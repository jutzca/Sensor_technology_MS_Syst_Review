We tested the hypothesis that physical activity was lower in a group of 17 MS patient (mean ± SD; age = 46 ± 6 yr, 11 females, 6 males) compared with 15 healthy sedentary control subjects (age = 44 ± 7 yr, 9 females, 6 males). Physical activity was measured with a three-dimensional accelerometer and with an activity questionnaire for 7 d. Vector magnitude values from the accelerometer for the MS and sedentary control subjects were 121,027 ± 59,336 and 185,892 ± 60,566 arbitrary units/day, respectively (P = 0.01). Estimated energy expenditure values derived from the questionnaire were 35.9 ± 3.0 and 36.2 ± 4.1 Kcal · kg(-1) · d(-1) (NS), respectively. Thus, when measured directly with an accelerometer, activity was lower in MS compared with sedentary control subjects. The data also suggest that the accelerometer was more sensitive than the questionnaire for detecting differences in activity between two relatively sedentary populations, including one with neurologic disease.";"Article";"10.1097/00005768-199704000-00014";"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=01959131&id=doi:10.1097%2F00005768-199704000-00014&atitle=Quantitation+of+lower+physical+activity+in+persons+with+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=MED.+SCI.+SPORTS+EXERC.&title=Medicine+and+Science+in+Sports+and+Exercise&volume=29&issue=4&spage=517&epage=523&aulast=Ng&aufirst=Alexander+V.&auinit=A.V.&aufull=Ng+A.V.&coden=MSCSB&isbn=&pages=517-523&date=1997&auinit1=A&auinitm=V";"Embase";"Yes";"";"";"yes";"";"";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

One method for increasing the level of participation in physical activity among MS patients involves the identification of factors that correlate with physical activity and that are modifiable by a well-designed intervention. Purpose: This study adopts a social cognitive perspective and examines self-efficacy, enjoyment, social support, and disability as correlates of participation in physical activity among individuals with MS. Methods: We recruited 196 individuals with a diagnosis of MS from the Midwest region of the United States. The participants completed a battery of questionnaires and then wore a belt with an accelerometer for a 7-day period. The data were analyzed using covariance modeling. Results: Enjoyment (γ = .38, p < .001), social support (γ = .15, p < .05), and disability (γ = .18, p < .01) had statistically significant direct relations with self-efficacy, and self-efficacy (β = .29, p < .001) and enjoyment (γ = .28, p < .001) had statistically significant direct relations with physical activity.

The literature suggests that individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) engage in less physical activity than non-diseased individuals. That conclusion, however, depends upon the validity of scores from measures of physical activity among the MS population. This study evaluated the validity of scores from two self-report surveys, a pedometer, and an accelerometer and during seven days of free-living conditions among individuals with MS. Method. Participants were 30 individuals (28 females, two males) with an established definite diagnosis of MS. The participants wore a pedometer and a single-axis accelerometer during the waking hours of a 7-day period. After the 7-day period, participants returned to the lab and completed a self-administered physical activity questionnaire and then underwent a 7-day physical activity recall. Results. There were strong correlations (a) between scores from the two self-report measures of physical activity and (b) between scores from the two objective measures of physical activity, and (c) weaker, but moderate-to-strong correlations between scores from the self-report and objective measures of physical activity.

The authors hypothesized that physical activity and symptoms would be interrelated and that physical activity would be indirectly associated with disability through a pathway that involved functional limitations, whereas symptoms would be directly associated with both functional limitations and disability. Methods: Individuals with MS (N= 133) who were recruited through a community organization wore an accelerometer for a 7-day period and completed a paper-and-pencil survey containing the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (G. Godin & R. J. Shephard, 1985), Symptom Inventory (C. E. Schwartz, T. Vollmer, & H. Lee, 1999), MS-Related Symptom Checklist (E. E. Gulick, 1989), and abbreviated Late-Life Function and Disability Inventory (E. McAuley, J. F. Konopack, R. W. Motl, K. Rosengren, & K. S. Morris, 2005).

Results: The standardized coefficients indicated that (a) physical activity and symptoms were negatively correlated (θ = -.59); (b) those who were more physically active had better function (γ = .40); (c) those with fewer symptoms had better function (γ = -.46) and less disability (γ = -.29); and (d) those with better function had less disability (β = .63).

Self-report instruments are commonly used to measure activity patterns; alternatively, actigraphs can be placed on several parts of the body. The aims of this study were to evaluate the superiority and specificity of actigraph placement ( wrist vs. ankle) in subjects with MS and healthy controls and explore the relationship between self-report and objective activity patterns. A total of 19 subjects with definite MS and 10 healthy volunteers wore actigraphs on the non-dominant wrist and ankle for three days while they kept a log to register performed activities every .5 h. Wrist and ankle actigraphs produced similar activity patterns during the most active hours (09:00-20:30 h) (ANOVA, time x location interaction: F = .901, df = 23, p = .597) in individuals with MS and healthy controls (between subjects factor F = 3.275, p = .083). Wrist placement of the actigraphs was better tolerated than ankle placement. Wrist actigraph data corresponded to a higher degree with self-reported activities of the upper limbs in the early afternoon, whereas ankle data seem to reflect better whole body movements in the later afternoon/early evening. Overall, actigraph data correlated moderately with self-reported activity (r = .57 for ankle and r = .59 for wrist). The regression model revealed that self-reported activities explained 44% of the variance in ankle and 50% of wrist data. Wrist and ankle actigraphs produce similar activity patterns in subjects with MS and in healthy controls; however, the placement of actigraphs on the wrist is better tolerated. Ankle actigraphs reflect general movement but underestimate upper body activity. Subjective registration of activity level partly matches with objective actigraph measurement. A combination of both objective and subjective activity registration is recommended to evaluate the physical activity pattern of subjects with MS.";"Article; Proceedings Paper";"10.1080/07420520701282364";"WOS:000246297100010";"WoS";"Yes";"";"";"yes";"";"";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Physical activity has been positively associated with QOL, but little is known about the factors that explain and/or confound the relationship in those with MS.

Ten people with MS (mean age 49 yr; Extended Disability Status Scale mean +/-standard deviation = 3.4 +/- 1.3) and ten nondisabled people (mean age 40 yr) wore the RT3 while they performed three discrete mobility tasks on two occasions separated by 1 week. The intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) calculated from the RT3 motion data for the group with MS were 0.64 for the 5-minute walk test (p = 0.01), 0.50 for the timed up and go test (p = 0.05), and 0.76 for the stair-climbing task (p = 0.002). For the control group, these values were 0.65 (p = 0.01), -0.04 (p = 0.54), and 0.39 (p = 0.11), respectively. We found that the RT3 can potentially provide stable data when measuring walking, but a more robust, yet participant-friendly, method of attaching the RT3 is required.

Design: Participants completed the PADS twice with seven days between repeated measures, while also wearing an Actical accelerometer. Semi-structured interview questions were used to explore the acceptability of the PADS. Subjects: Thirty participants were recruited from the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Auckland, New Zealand. Mean age of participants was 54 years (range 27-76). Main measures: Physical Activity and Disability Survey (PADS) and Actical accelerometer. Results: A wide range of standardized PADS scores were recorded at each time-point (ranges 6.7-83.3 and 6.7-87.4). While standardized PADS scores between time-points had a high intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.92 (95% confidence interval (Cl) 0.88, 0.98), Bland-Altman 95% limits of agreement (- 17.4, 17.4) were modest. Accelerometer activity counts were not accurately predicted by standardized PADS scores (wide 95% prediction intervals).

Protocol: Individuals with multiple sclerosis were recruited to inactive, moderately active and active groups as defined by Adjusted Activity Scores from the Human Activity Profile. Control participants were recruited to an active group. Free-living physical activity was recorded over four consecutive days. Main measures: A TriTrac RT3 accelerometer and a self-report physical activity diary were used to measure activity. Results: Thirty-six participants completed data collection.

Results: Accelerometer counts and GLTEQ scores had similarly sized correlations with scores from generic (SF-12) and the disease-specific (MSIS-29) measures of HRQL and generic (SWLS) and the disease-specific (LMSQOL) measures of QOL. Path analysis indicated a similar pattern of directional relationships between accelerometer counts and GLTEQ scores with physical and mental HRQL and, in turn, physical and mental HRQL with QOL using generic and disease-targeted instruments. Conclusions: Our results suggest that in cross-sectional analysis, physical activity is similarly related with QOL and HRQL using generic and disease-targeted instruments in persons with MS. © 2008 The Society of Behavioral Medicine.";"Article";"10.1007/S12160-008-9049-4";"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=08836612&id=doi:10.1007%2Fs12160-008-9049-4&atitle=Does+the+relationship+between+physical+activity+and+quality+of+life+differ+based+on+generic+versus+disease-targeted+instruments%3F&stitle=Ann.+Behav.+Med.&title=Annals+of+Behavioral+Medicine&volume=36&issue=1&spage=93&epage=99&aulast=Motl&aufirst=Robert+W.&auinit=R.W.&aufull=Motl+R.W.&coden=ABMEE&isbn=&pages=93-99&date=2008&auinit1=R&auinitm=W";"Embase";"Yes";"";"";"yes";"";"";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Measuring free-living physical activity in adults with and without neurologic dysfunction with a triaxial accelerometer. Objective: To investigate the reliability, validity, and utility of a triaxial accelerometer to measure physical activity in the free-living environment in adults with and without neurologic dysfunction. Design: Repeated-measures design. Setting: General community. Participants: Volunteer sample of 17 men and 30 women (age range, 28-91y) living in the community with stroke of greater than 6 months in duration (n=20), Parkinson disease (n=7), or multiple sclerosis (n=11), and healthy but sedentary controls (n=9). Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Physical activity measured with the TriTrac RT3 accelerometer, 7-day recall questionnaire, and activity diary. Results: The accelerometer reliably measured free-living physical activity (intraclass correlation coefficient, .85; 95% confidence interval, .74-.91; P=.000). The standard error of measurement indicated that a second test would differ from a baseline test by ±23%. Mean daily RT3 data collected in the first 3 days differed significantly from that of the mean daily RT3 data collected over 7 days. The RT3 appeared to distinguish level of mobility better than the 7-day recall questionnaire, and participants found the RT3 to be a user-friendly and acceptable measure of physical activity. Conclusions: The triaxial accelerometer provided a stable measure of free-living physical activity, was found to distinguish between people with varying levels of mobility, and was well tolerated by participants. The results indicate that collecting data for 3 days was not reflective of data collected over 7 days. © 2008 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.";"Article";"10.1016/J.APMR.2008.02.027";"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=00039993&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.apmr.2008.02.027&atitle=Measuring+Free-Living+Physical+Activity+in+Adults+With+and+Without+Neurologic+Dysfunction+With+a+Triaxial+Accelerometer&stitle=Arch.+Phys.+Med.+Rehabil.&title=Archives+of+Physical+Medicine+and+Rehabilitation&volume=89&issue=9&spage=1765&epage=1771&aulast=Hale&aufirst=Leigh+A.&auinit=L.A.&aufull=Hale+L.A.&coden=APMHA&isbn=&pages=1765-1771&date=2008&auinit1=L&auinitm=A";"Embase";"Yes";"";"";"yes";"";"";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

The present study examined the nature of the associations among MS-related symptoms, exercise self-efficacy, and physical activity behavior in 80 individuals with a definite diagnosis of MS. Participants completed a measure of MS-related symptoms and self-efficacy and then wore an accelerometer for seven days. Both the frequency of overall symptoms and the frequency of motor symptoms had significant moderate inverse relationships with physical activity behavior (r = -0.47, P < 0.0001 and r = -0.49, P < 0.0001, respectively). Additionally, exercise self-efficacy was significantly and moderately correlated with physical activity (r = 0.39, P < 0.0001) and had significant and moderate inverse relationships with overall symptom frequency (r = -0.40, P < 0.0001) and motor symptom frequency (r = -0.30, P = 0.008). Path analysis demonstrated that both overall symptoms and motor symptoms had direct effects on physical activity as well as indirect effects on physical activity by way of self-efficacy.

Calibration of accelerometer output for ambulatory adults with multiple sclerosis. Objectives: To examine the association between the rates of accelerometer activity counts and energy expenditure during walking in persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) versus controls and then to calibrate the output of accelerometers for computing time spent in light, moderate, and vigorous physical activity based on common metabolic equivalent unit categories in persons with MS. Design: Mixed-model design. Setting: Laboratory. Participants: People with MS (n=24) and people without MS (n=24) who were similar in age, sex, height, and weight. Interventions: The participants undertook three 6-minute periods of walking at 3.2, 4.8, and 6.4km·h(-1) on a motor-driven treadmill. Main Outcome Measures: Activity counts and energy expenditure were measured with an accelerometer worn on the right hip and open-circuit spirometry, respectively. Results: The results indicated that (1) persons with MS had greater energy expenditure, but not activity counts, during walking on a treadmill than did controls; (2) there was a strong linear relationship between activity counts and energy expenditure during treadmill walking, but the slope of the relationship was steeper in persons with MS than in controls; and (3) the cut-points for light, moderate, and vigorous physical activity were lower in persons with MS than in controls. Conclusions: Such findings provide evidence for a strong linear relationship between activity counts and energy expenditure during walking in persons with MS and cut-points based on counts per minute for quantifying time spent in light, moderate, and vigorous physical activity using accelerometers in this population. © 2009 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine.";"Article";"10.1016/J.APMR.2009.03.020";"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=00039993&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.apmr.2009.03.020&atitle=Calibration+of+Accelerometer+Output+for+Ambulatory+Adults+With+Multiple+Sclerosis&stitle=Arch.+Phys.+Med.+Rehabil.&title=Archives+of+Physical+Medicine+and+Rehabilitation&volume=90&issue=10&spage=1778&epage=1784&aulast=Motl&aufirst=Robert+W.&auinit=R.W.&aufull=Motl+R.W.&coden=APMHA&isbn=&pages=1778-1784&date=2009&auinit1=R&auinitm=W";"Embase";"Yes";"";"";"no";"Out of scope";"";"Included";"";"included";"accelerometer used as outcome measure";NA

Methods: The sample included 133 individuals with MS who completed the SI-L, Performance Scales (PS), EDSS, Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale-12 (MSWS-12), Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale-29 (MSIS-29), and Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ) and then wore an accelerometer for 7 days. The data were analyzed using SPSS, version 16.0. Results: There were large correlations between SI-S and SI-L total and subscale scores and between SI-S, SI-L, and PS total scores. The correlations were similar in magnitude between SI-S, SI-L, and PS scores with EDSS and MSIS-29 scores, but not with MSWS-12, accelerometer, and GLTEQ scores. Discriminant function analysis indicated that SI-S scores better differentiated groups with minimal, moderate, and severe disability than did SI-L and PS scores. Regression analysis indicated that SI-S and SI-L scores explained incrementally more variance in EDSS, MSWS-12, and MSIS-29 scores after accounting for PS scores alone. Conclusion: Such findings provide additional support for the validity of both SI-S and SI-L scores in individuals with MS and support the adoption of either the SI-S or SI-L by clinical MS researchers. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Exploring Actical accelerometers as an objective measure of physical activity in people with multiple sclerosis. Objective: To assess the feasibility, acceptability, and psychometric properties of Actical accelerometers in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). Design: Participants attended 2 testing sessions 7 days apart in which they completed 6 activities ranging in intensity while wearing an Actical accelerometer and Polar heart rate monitor. Perceived exertion was recorded after each activity. Setting: University research center. Participants: People (N=31) with a definite diagnosis of MS were purposefully selected, aiming for diversity in level of reported disability, age, sex, and type of MS. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Actical accelerometer, Polar S810i and RS800sd heart rate monitors, Borg rating of perceived exertion, six-minute walk test (6MWT), 30-second chair stand test. Results: Accelerometers had good feasibility and acceptability in people with MS. Test-retest reliability was poor for sedentary and free-living activities, with low to moderate intraclass correlation coefficients (.00-.75), but was better for more vigorous or rhythmic activities (.85-.90). Bland-Altman 95% limits of agreement for average accelerometer counts were wide, ranging from ±16 (newspaper reading) to ±1330 (6MWT). Validity was not established with 95% prediction intervals showing high variability for all activities.

The system uses microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) sensors to measure movements of the upper limb representative of everyday tasks. Surface electromyogram (EMG) measurements are taken simultaneously to provide gross muscle activity data. A dynamic model is used to simulate the movements, allowing particular sites to be studied in detail. Initial movement data is presented, comparing analysed EMG data and torque estimated by the dynamic model around the elbow joint. Despite the simple analysis, a good fit was obtained. The dynamic model includes a neuromuscular modelling system which will be used in future work to simulate the interactions between measured movements containing intention tremor and the intention behind them, allowing better understanding of the tremor and creating better descriptions of the tremor. Future work will use measured data and modelling to develop methods of attenuating intention tremor, by providing real-time feedback control of tremor reduction devices, without adversely affecting the underlying intended movement.";"Proceedings Paper";NA;"WOS:000265911300045";"WoS";"No";"Duplicate";"";"yes";"";"Multiple sensors on body";"Included";"";"included";"";NA

This study tested the assumption that a waist-worn accelerometer should capture the intra- and inter-person variation in walking behavior. Twenty-four participants with a neurologist-confirmed diagnosis of MS and who were ambulatory with minimal assistance undertook three 6-min periods of over-ground walking that involved comfortable (CWS) and then slower (SWS) and faster (FWS) walking speeds while wearing ActiGraph, model 7164, accelerometers around the waist and ankle. The experimental manipulation of walking was successful such that the CWS was 76.7±13.0m/min (range=55.6-105.14), whereas the SWS and FWS were 64.3±12.3m/min (range=44.5-90.1) and 89.1±13.8m/min (range=60.9-116.4), respectively. Movement counts from the waist and ankle-worn accelerometer were strongly associated with the manipulation of speed, but the association was stronger for the waist than ankle based on both eta-squared estimates (η(2) values=78 and 46) and the average squared multiple correlations from individual regression analyses (R(2) values=97±04 and 88±21). The bivariate correlation between movement counts from the waist-worn accelerometer and speed of walking (r=823, p=001) was large in magnitude and significantly different (z=3.22, p=001) from that between movement counts from the ankle-worn unit and walking speed (r=549, p=001).

Design: Test-retest design; 6 research assistants visited the participants twice within 1 week in the home situation. Setting: General community. Participants: A convenience sample of ambulatory patients (N=43; mean age +/- SD, 48.7 +/- 7.0y; 30 women; median Expanded Disability Status Scale scores, 3.5; interquartile range, 2.5) were recruited from the outpatient clinic of a university medical center.

"97";"Suh Y., Motl R.W., Mohr D.C.";"Physical activity, disability, and mood in the early stage of multiple sclerosis";"Disability and Health Journal";2010;"Background: Early multiple sclerosis (MS) may constitute a period of particular vulnerability to psychological distress such as anxiety and depression. Physical activity is a potentially modifiable, behavioral correlate of anxiety and depression in the early stages of MS. Objective: The present study provides an initial examination of the associations between physical activity and anxiety and depression in early MS. We hypothesized that physical activity might be a correlate of anxiety and depression in early MS and that this association might be indirect and accounted for by disability. Methods: The sample included 96 individuals with a mean duration of MS of 3.0 years (SD = 1.5, range = 0.5-5 years). The participants wore an accelerometer for 7 days as an objective measure of physical activity and then completed the Patient Determined Disease Steps (PDDS) scale and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Results: Descriptive analysis indicated that 41% and 43% of the sample had elevated levels of anxiety and depression, respectively, based on HADS scores (i.e., score ≥8). Correlation analysis indicated that physical activity was significantly associated with depression (r = -0.25; ρ = -.23), but not anxiety (r = -0.05; ρ = -.02). Path analysis indicated that the association between physical activity and depression was entirely indirect by way of disability (path coefficient = -0.23). Conclusions: Such results suggest that physical activity could be an important health promoting behavior for reducing depression in the early stages of MS and this should be the focus of subsequent randomized controlled clinical trials. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Fifty persons with multiple sclerosis (Expanded Disability Status Scale, EDSS, 1.5-6.5) were tested on leg muscle strength as well as walking and balance capacity, and completed self-report indices on perceived physical functioning. Habitual walking performance, that is, the real amount of steps that is performed in the customary living environment, was registered by means of an ambulant accelerometer-based monitor during seven consecutive days. Mild (EDSS 1.5-4.0, n = 29) and moderate (EDSS 4.5-6.5, n = 21) multiple sclerosis subgroups were additionally distinguished as predictor variables and values were hypothesized to differ depending on multiple sclerosis severity and concomitant ambulatory function. Multiple regression analyses yielded a single most significant predictor for each (sub)group with other variables making no independent contribution to the variation in habitual walking performance. For the total study sample, this was the 6-Minute Walking Test (R(2) = 0.458, p < 0.01). In the mild multiple sclerosis subgroup, the 6-Minute Walking Test was again most predictive, yet to a modest degree (R(2) = 0. 187, p = 0.02). In the moderate multiple sclerosis subgroup, the 2-Minute Walking Test explained over half of the variance (R(2) = 0.532, p < 0.01). Habitual walking performance is best reflected by longer walking capacity tests. The extent to which it can be predicted based on clinical testing is larger in a multiple sclerosis patient sample with more severe walking disability. Ambulatory monitoring, however, includes aspects of community ambulation not captured in the clinic, and must be considered as an additional outcome for evaluating interventions in multiple sclerosis. © 2010 The Author(s).";"Article";"10.1177/1352458510361357";"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13524585&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458510361357&atitle=Predicting+habitual+walking+performance+in+multiple+sclerosis%3A+Relevance+of+capacity+and+self-report+measures&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=16&issue=5&spage=618&epage=626&aulast=Gijbels&aufirst=Domien&auinit=D.&aufull=Gijbels+D.&coden=MUSCF&isbn=&pages=618-626&date=2010&auinit1=D&auinitm=";"Embase";"No";"Out of scope (topic)";"";"yes";"";"";"Included";"";"included";"accelerometer used as outcome measure";NA

We examined total movement counts and three novel methods of processing accelerometer data (i.e. standard deviation, approximate entropy and detrended fluctuation analysis) for quantifying real-life walking impairment in this population. A total of 70 individuals with a definite diagnosis of multiple sclerosis completed a battery of patient-rated measures of walking impairment and then wore an ActiGraph accelerometer for 7 days. The data were analyzed using multivariate analysis of variance and bivariate correlation analysis. The results indicated that total daily movement counts and standard deviation of daily movement counts differed between groups of persons with mild, moderate, and severe self-reported disability status and who were independently ambulatory or ambulatory with assistance. Those two metrics for the accelerometer data further demonstrated strong correlations with patient-rated measures of walking impairment. By comparison, there were smaller and often non-significant differences in approximate entropy and detrended fluctuation analysis metrics for the accelerometer data as a function of disability and ambulatory status, and only moderate correlations with patient-rated measures of walking impairment. The results confirm that the metric of total daily movement counts correlates with level of disability, ambulatory status, and patient reports of walking impairment in persons with multiple sclerosis. We further demonstrate that variability, indexed by the standard deviation of daily movement counts, correlates with multiple sclerosis-related disability, ambulatory status, and self-reported walking impairment. Such results provide preliminary evidence that variability in accelerometer counts is not simply noise and may provide important information about multiple sclerosis-related walking impairment.© 2010 The Author(s).";"Article";"10.1177/1352458510373111";"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13524585&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458510373111&atitle=Real-life+walking+impairment+in+multiple+sclerosis%3A+Preliminary+comparison+of+four+methods+for+processing+accelerometry+data&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=16&issue=7&spage=868&epage=877&aulast=Sosnoff&aufirst=Jacob+J.&auinit=J.J.&aufull=Sosnoff+J.J.&coden=MUSCF&isbn=&pages=868-877&date=2010&auinit1=J&auinitm=J";"Embase";"Yes";"";"";"yes";"";"";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

The evaluation of the effectiveness of an orthosis is generally based on subjective criteria, on functional scores or on motor performance tests [1-3]. Wearable inertial devices can be reliably used in these cases for outcome measurements with respect to the proposed treatment [4,5]. Material and methods A 62mm×36mm×16mm, Free4Act device, sampling frequency 50 Hz, was stuck at the L5 level, in 10 hemiplegic patients (5 with stroke and in 5 patients with Multiple Sclerosis). The equinus foot was corrected using an AFO. Subjects were asked to walk 20 meter distance at comfortable speed, and gait time-distance parameters were reconstructed by means of the device. Subjects performed three walking repetitions, with and without the orthosis. Data of patients were compared with those of normal subjects previously acquired and validated with a Vicon stereophotogrammetric system 612. Results Although many parameters showed improvement on an individual basis none of them resulted statistically significant when the entire sample of patients was analysed (Mann Whitney with exact method for small samples). (Table presented) Discussion These results show that the inertial device is sensitive to measure gait parameters providing a useful indicator of outcome in patients with AFO.

The sensors were placed on anatomical segments of the lower limb: foot, shank, thigh, and hip, and the motion data were then captured in conjunction with 3D ground reaction forces (GRFs). The method of relational matrix was applied to develop a rule-based system, an intelligent fuzzy computational algorithm. The rule-based system provides a feature matrix model representing the strength of association or interaction amongst the elements of the gait functions (limb-segments accelerations and GRFs) throughout the gait cycle. A comparison between the reference rule-based data and an input test data was evaluated using a fuzzy similarity algorithm. This system was tested and evaluated using two subject groups: 10 healthy subjects were recruited to establish the reference fuzzy rule-base, and 4 relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis subjects were used as an input test data; and the grade of similarity between them was evaluated. This similarity provides a quantitative assessment of mobility state of the impaired subject. This algorithmic tool may be helpful to the clinician in the identification of pathological gait impairments, prescribe treatment, and assess the improvements in response to therapeutic intervention.

To characterise the use of tilt-in-space systems and to form recommendations for tilt prescription and training based upon its use. Method. Wheelchair occupancy and seat position of 45 full-time power wheelchair users were monitored for 1-2 weeks using an accelerometer, occupancy switch and data logger. Demographics, pressure ulcer history, functional and physical presentations of their disability, and sensation were also documented. Results. Participants spent 12.1 h in their wheelchairs daily, with a median typical position of 8° (0°-47°). The median participant tilted every 27 min (0.1-16.6 tilts per occupancy hour). Pressure-relieving tilts (i.e. a tilt ≥ 30° for ≥ 1 min) were performed, on average, once every 10 h (0-2.2/h). Participants spent 19% of their seated time tilted past 15°. Seventeen participants utilised the tilt feature frequently and spent >20% of the time in multiple positions. The remaining participants sat in a single tilt range for >80% of the time. Conclusions. Given the limited pressure relief compliance, alternative approaches to pressure relief and improved training may be needed for some clients.

Methods: In 13 CS and 12 controls, CAF was assessed by the Piper Fatigue Scale (PFS), Epworth Sleepiness Scale-Depression subscale (CES-D), physical activity (accelerometer), and hemoglobin levels (Hb). Muscle measures included strength, activation, contractile properties, and endurance during intermittent dorsiflexion. Testing occurred before and after 6 weeks of AT in CS. Results: After RT, the PFS score increased from initial levels in CS only without changes in sleepiness, depression, or physical activity. Hb decreased in CS only [mean (SD): pre, 15 (1.1); post, 14.5 (1.1) g/dl; P = 0.04]. Endurance decreased in CS [mean (SD): pre, 519 (340) s; post, 388 (203) s; P = 0.04] and increased in controls [mean (SD): pre, 616 (387) s; post, 753 (553) s; P = 0.03].

Material/Methods: The study included 49 consecutive patients with relapsing-remitting MS who received Solu-Medrol 1000 mg/day over 3 days for relapse with difficulties in walking. The following walking-based measures were administered before and a month after IVMP: the Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale-12 (MSWS-12), the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), the 2-minute timed walk (2-minTW), the 25-foot walk test (25FWT), the Six Spot Step Test (SSST). All patients had worn the step activity monitor accelerometer (SAM) 1 week prior to IVMP was applied and wore it again the fourth week upon the corticosteroid therapy was completed. The SAM analysis utilized the average daily step count and data regarding frequency and intensity of walking over a continuous time interval. We examined: (1) the impact of IVMP on the recovery of walking ability; (2) the responsiveness of each walking-based measure; (3) the relative responsiveness of competing walking-based measures; and (4) the impact of different walking-based measures responsiveness on clinical trials. Results: All walking-based measures showed significant improvement of walking ability 1 month after the IVMP. The most responsive were MSWS-12 and EDSS. Different responsiveness implied a greater than 6-fold impact on sample size estimates. Conclusions: All applied walking-based measures showed significant improvement of walking ability 1 month after the IVMP.

This study examined the effects of gait disability on 1) the association between rates of energy expenditure and accelerometer output in overground walking and 2) the calibration of accelerometer output for quantifying time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in people with MS. The sample consisted of 24 individuals with MS, of whom 10 reported gait disability based on Patient-Determined Disease Steps (PDDS) scores. The participants undertook three 6-minute periods of overground walking while wearing an accelerometer and a portable metabolic unit (K4b2, Cosmed, Rome, Italy). In the first period of walking, the participants walked at a self-selected, comfortable speed. In the two subsequent walking periods, participants walked at speeds above and below (±0.5 mph) the comfortable walking speed, respectively. Strong linear relationships were observed between rates of accelerometer activity counts and energy expenditure during walking in the overall sample (R(2) = 0.90) and subsamples with (R(2) = 0.88) and without gait disability (R(2) = 0.91). The slope of the relationship was significantly steeper in the subsample with gait disability (β= 0.0049) than in the subsample without gait disability (β= 0.0026). The difference in slopes resulted in a significantly lower cut-point for MVPA (1886 vs. 2717 counts/min) in those with gait disability.

Self-report questionnaires rely on the participant's cognitive function and reporting accuracy, while the association between clinical timed walk tests and community ambulation may not be strong. Progress toward the identification of an appropriate clinical tool to measure strides in PD and MS populations is hampered by the lack of meaningful research and reference standards in this area. Purpose: The objective of the present study was to explore the validity of the StepWatch Step Activity Monitor (SAM) in assessing stride count in persons with PD or MS. The SAM is a 2-dimensional accelerometer that counts strides and is calibrated for individual participants. Methods: A convenience sample of 20 participants completed a health history interview. Participants ambulated approximately 15 m while wearing the SAM to establish appropriate baseline calibrations, matching their stride with the device settings. Next, participants took 3 passes over the GaitMat II (GM II) while wearing the SAM. Strides counted by the GM were compared with the strides counted by the SAM. Results: The Pearson correlation coefficients (r) for MS and PD, respectively, were 0.99 and 1.0. Conclusions: Our investigation presents preliminary data that shows the concurrent validity of the SAM when compared with the gold standard GM. The SAM appears to be a valid tool for use in persons with PD and MS. The validity was apparent in a population of widely varying impairment levels.

The physiological and functional parameters related to fatigue in MS patients are currently not well established. A new wearable wireless body measurement system, named Fatigue Monitoring System (FAMOS), was developed to study fatigue in MS. It can continuously measure electrocardiogram, body-skin temperature, electromyogram and motions of feet. The goal of this study is to test the ability of distinguishing fatigued MS patients from healthy subjects by the use of FAMOS. This paper presents the realization of the measurement system including the design of both hardware and dedicated signal processing algorithms. Twenty-six participants including 17 MS patients with fatigue and 9 sex- and age-matched healthy controls were included in the study for continuous 24h monitoring. The preliminary results show significant differences between fatigued MS patients and healthy controls. In conclusion, the FAMOS enables continuous data acquisition and estimation of multiple physiological and functional parameters. It provides a new, flexible and objective approach to study fatigue in MS, which can distinguish between fatigued MS patients and healthy controls.

Thirty-one MS and twenty-eight age- and sex-matched control subjects were tested using body-worn sensors both during quiet stance and gait (Timed Up and Go test, TUG). Results were compared to stopwatch-timed measures. Stopwatch durations of the TUG and Timed 25 Foot Walk tests were not significantly different between groups. However, during quiet stance with eyes closed, people with MS had significantly greater sway acceleration amplitude than controls (. p=. 0.02). During gait, people with MS had greater trunk angular range of motion in roll (medio-lateral flexion, . p=. 0.017) and yaw (axial rotation, . p=. 0.026) planes. Turning duration through 180° was also longer in MS (. p=. 0.031). Thus, body-worn motion sensors detected mobility differences between MS and healthy controls when traditional timed tests could not.

Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: University research room. Participants: People with MS who used at most a stick to walk outdoors (MS-A; n=19), people with MS who used bilateral support for gait (MS-B; n=11), and healthy controls (n=15). Interventions: Participants completed 85 minutes of 9 scripted everyday activities. Main Outcome Measures: Estimates of metabolic equivalent thresholds (METs) and kilocalories from a portable metabolic system, and steps counted from video of the activities. Step and MET estimates from an integrative accelerometer and from a uniaxial accelerometer, and kilocalorie estimates from the integrative accelerometer. Results: The uniaxial accelerometer had >30% error for steps for all groups. MET estimates had an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) <0.2 for all groups. For the integrative accelerometer, step estimates for controls had an ICC of.69 and <1% error. The step estimates for MS-A and MS-B groups had >20% error. The MET estimates had an ICC of.50 to.65 and 6% to 15% error. Kilocalorie estimates had 2.9% error for controls, 8.16% for MS-A, and 2.56% for MS-B groups. ICCs were all >.67, and mean differences from criterion were <20kcal. Conclusions: The agreement between steps and MET estimates from both devices and the criterion was poor, particularly for people with MS. Only the step and MET estimates for the control group for the integrative accelerometer were not significantly different from the criterion.

Ambulatory persons (5 males/17 females; 13 without aid/9 with aid) with MS wore a triaxial accelerome-ter (ActiGraph GT3X, Health One Technologies; Fort Walton Beach, Florida) as well as an IDEEA system (MiniSun, Inc; Fresno, Florida) over the course of a single day. Outcome mea-sures for the accelerometer included movement counts/hour for the vertical, anterior-posterior, and mediolateral axes. Outcomes for the IDEEA system included percent time walking, sitting, and standing, as well as walking speed. Pearson product corre-lations (r) were used to examine the associations between out-comes from the accelerometer and IDEEA system. Significant correlations were observed between percent walking time and movement counts/hour along the vertical (r = 0.84) and ante-rior-posterior (r = 0.69) axes. Significant correlations were fur-ther noted between movement counts/hour along the vertical axis and walking speed (r = 0.45) and self-report walking impairment (r =-0.50) and disability (r =-0.46).

To examine the association between fall history and physical activity using an objective measure of physical activity (i.e., accelerometry) in persons with multiple sclerosis. Design. A community-based sample of 75 ambulatory persons with multiple sclerosis volunteered for the investigation. Participants self-reported fall history in the last year, underwent a neurological exam to determine Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score, and wore an accelerometer around the waist for 7 consecutive days to determine physical activity. Results. Overall, 37 persons (49.3 of the sample) reported falling in the last year with 28 of the 37 falling more than once. Persons who fell in the last year had a significantly lower number of steps/day than nonfallers (3510 versus 4940 steps/day; P .05). However, when controlling for disability status there was no statistically significant difference between fallers and nonfallers (4092 versus 4373 steps/day; P >.05). Conclusions. Collectively, the findings suggest that fall history may have little impact on current physical activity levels in persons with multiple sclerosis. © 2012 J. J.

This study compared physical activity levels between large samples of persons with mild MS and matched controls using validated measures of physical activity. Materials and methods: The sample included 77 cases of MS and 77 controls matched on age, height, weight, and gender. Physical activity was assessed using five measures, namely the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ), International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), and activity counts per day, step counts per day, and time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) per day by accelerometry. Results: There were statistically significant differences between groups in accelerometer activity counts (t = -3.87, P = 0.0001), accelerometer step counts (t = -4.29, P = 0.0001), time spent in MVPA (t = -2.39, P = 0.01), GLTEQ scores (t = -3.83, P = 0.0001), and IPAQ scores (t = -3.42, P = 0.0001). The average effect size across all five measures was d = -0.59 and indicated that persons with MS overall were moderately less physically active than the matched controls. Conclusions: The primary finding was a moderate reduction in physical activity among those with MS, but the magnitude was substantially smaller than reported in a published meta-analysis. Importantly, the degree of physical inactivity can likely be overcome through the delivery of behavioral interventions for increasing physical activity and this should translate into meaningful consequences for persons with MS. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.";"Article";"10.1111/J.1600-0404.2011.01634.X";"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=00016314&id=doi:10.1111%2Fj.1600-0404.2011.01634.x&atitle=Physical+activity+and+multiple+sclerosis%3A+New+insights+regarding+inactivity&stitle=Acta+Neurol.+Scand.&title=Acta+Neurologica+Scandinavica&volume=126&issue=4&spage=256&epage=262&aulast=Sandroff&aufirst=B.M.&auinit=B.M.&aufull=Sandroff+B.M.&coden=ANRSA&isbn=&pages=256-262&date=2012&auinit1=B&auinitm=M";"Embase";"Yes";"";"";"yes";"";"";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Despite this, very little is known about the antecedents and consequences of self-esteem in persons with MS. Objectives: To examine (1) physical activity and social support as potentially modifiable correlates (i.e., antecedents) of self-esteem and (2) physical and psychological health-related quality of life as possible consequences of self-esteem in persons with MS. Methods: Participants (N = 46) wore an Actigraph accelerometer for 7 days and then completed a battery of questionnaires, including the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES), Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29), and Social Provisions Scale (SPS). The data were analyzed using PASW Statistics 18. Results: Bivariate correlation analysis indicated that average daily step counts (r = .298, p = .026) and social support (r = .366, p = .007) were significantly correlated with self-esteem. Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that only social support was a significant predictor of self-esteem scores (β = .411, p = .004); pedometer steps approached significance as a predictor of self-esteem (β = .178, p = .112). Bivariate correlation analysis further indicated significant negative associations between self-esteem and physical (r = -.391, p = .004) and psychological (r = -.540, p = .0001) domains of health-related quality of life (HRQOL), indicating that higher self-esteem was associated with more positive HRQOL.

However, in the literature there are only a few papers that address this disorder. The aim of this study is to identify objectively subclinical abnormal gait strategies in these patients. Methods: Eleven patients affected by self-reported unsteadiness during gait (4 TBI and 7 MS) and ten healthy subjects underwent gait analysis while walking back and forth on a 15-m long corridor. Time-distance parameters, ankle sagittal motion, and muscular activity during gait were acquired by a wearable gait analysis system (Step32, DemItalia, Italy) on a high number of successive strides in the same walk and statistically processed. Both self-selected gait speed and high speed were tested under relatively unconstrained conditions. Non-parametric statistical analysis (Mann-Whitney, Wilcoxon tests) was carried out on the means of the data of the two examined groups. Results: The main findings, with data adjusted for velocity of progression, show that increased double support and reduced velocity of progression are the main parameters to discriminate patients with self-reported unsteadiness from healthy controls. Muscular intervals of activation showed a significant increase in the activity duration of the Rectus Femoris and Tibialis Anterior in patients with respect to the control group at high speed. Conclusions: Patients with a subjective sensation of instability, not clinically documented, walk with altered strategies, especially at high gait speed. This is thought to depend on the mechanisms of postural control and coordination. The gait anomalies detected might explain the symptoms reported by the patients and allow for a more focused treatment design. The wearable gait analysis system used for long distance statistical walking assessment was able to detect subtle differences in functional performance monitoring, otherwise not detectable by common clinical examinations.";"Article";"10.1186/1743-0003-9-64";"WOS:000310270200001";"WoS";"Yes";"";"";"no";"";"";"Out of scope (topic)";"";"included";"";"in"

Disability status and progression are associated with reduced physical activity (PA) and cardiovascular function. Lack of adequate PA combined with inflammation may create high susceptibility to subclinical atherosclerosis and vascular dysfunction. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to compare subclinical atherosclerosis and arterial function between individuals with and without MS matched for age, sex, and body mass index. Methods: Thirty-three individuals diagnosed with MS and 33 controls underwent strain gauge plethysmography for resting forearm blood flow (FBF) and peak reactive hyperemia for the microvascular function. Intima-media thickness and arterial compliance (AC) were measured using carotid ultrasound for vascular function. C-reactive protein and PA (7-d accelerometer data) were also measured. Results: There was a significant difference (P G 0.05) in resting FBF, peak reactive hyperemia, central pulse wave velocity, and AC between the MS and control groups. PA was associated with peak FBF and central pulse wave velocity but not FBF and carotid AC. Individuals with MS exhibit reduced arterial function but similar intima-media thickness compared with controls. Persons with MS had significantly reduced PA levels compared with controls, and PA accounted for differences in arterial function between groups. Conclusions: These results indicate that subclinical markers of atherosclerosis are higher in individuals with MS, suggesting a higher risk of cardiovascular disease in this population. However, the higher levels of subclinical atherosclerosis were accounted for by the low PA in persons with MS, suggesting that increasing PA may reduce the increase in cardiovascular disease risk in patients with MS.

For pathological populations, changes in variability during gait signal the presence of abnormal motor control strategies. For persons with multiple sclerosis (PwMS), extensive gait problems have been reported including changes in gait variability. While previous studies have focused on footfall variability, the present study used accelerometers on the trunk to measure variability during walking. Thus, the purpose of this study was to examine the variability of the acceleration pattern of the upper and lower trunk in PwMS compared to healthy controls. We extracted linear and nonlinear measures of gait variability from 30 s of steady state walking for 15 PwMS and 15 age-matched healthy controls. PwMS had altered variability compared to controls with greater Lyapunov exponent in the ML (p < 0.001) and AP (p < 0.001) directions, and greater frequency dispersion in the ML direction (p = 0.034). PwMS also demonstrated greater mean velocity in the ML direction (p = 0.045) and lower root mean square of acceleration in the AP direction (p = 0.040).

The SAM analysis included the average daily step count, the average steps/min of the highest 1 min of a day, and the average steps/min of the highest continuous 60 min of a day. The WA-VAS scores significantly and strongly correlated with EDSS (ρ = 0.679, P < 0.001), 25FWT (ρ = 0.606, P < 0.001), SSST (ρ = 0.729, P < 0.001), 2 min TW (ρ = -0.643, P < 0.001), MSWS-12 (ρ = 0.746, P < 0.001), average daily step count (ρ = -0.507, P < 0.001), average steps/min of the highest 1 min of a day (ρ = -0.544, P < 0.001), and average steps/min of the highest continuous 60 min of a day (ρ = -0.473, P < 0.001). Correlations between WA-VAS and measures of walking ability used in clinical research of MS were satisfactory. The results obtained in this research indicate that the WA-VAS could be an instrument for simple measurement of walking limitations in MSPs in the clinical setting. © 2013 Belgian Neurological Society.";"Article";"10.1007/S13760-013-0187-5";"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=22402993&id=doi:10.1007%2Fs13760-013-0187-5&atitle=Correlation+analysis+of+visual+analogue+scale+and+measures+of+walking+ability+in+multiple+sclerosis+patients&stitle=Acta+Neurol.+Belg.&title=Acta+Neurologica+Belgica&volume=113&issue=4&spage=397&epage=402&aulast=Filipovi%C4%87+Gr%C4%8Di%C4%87&aufirst=Petar&auinit=P.&aufull=Filipovi%C4%87+Gr%C4%8Di%C4%87+P.&coden=ANUBB&isbn=&pages=397-402&date=2013&auinit1=P&auinitm=";"Embase";"Yes";"";"";"yes";"";"";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

We studied 17 patients affected by Parkinson's disease, 24 with ataxic gait due to different diseases and 24 healthy subjects supplied with a triaxial accelerometer with a portable datalogger which measures acceleration and deceleration on an anterior-posterior, mediolateral and vertical plane at an approximate level of the center of mass (back sacral localization) and in other two positions (sternal and frontal sacral region) during a steady-state walking. Analyses of the basic accelerometric parameters associated with a jerk analysis allowed us to differentiate between the population groups. We observed a significant reduction of acceleration parameters in neurological patients when compared with healthy subjects, with a reduction of the mean acceleration of 0.30 m/s(2) for ataxic and 0.64 m/s(2) for parkinsonian patients (t test, p < 0.01). The root-mean square of the accelerations was used to quantify the attenuations of accelerations. This study suggests that a triaxial accelerometer is a good practical and an economic tool for assessing the alteration of perambulation. Moreover, it is plausible to use these data to obtain objective parameters in the evaluation of the progression of the disease and the efficacy of therapeutic tools. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.";"Article";"10.1007/S10072-012-1017-X";"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=15901874&id=doi:10.1007%2Fs10072-012-1017-x&atitle=Gait+measures+with+a+triaxial+accelerometer+among+patients+with+neurological+impairment&stitle=Neurol.+Sci.&title=Neurological+Sciences&volume=34&issue=4&spage=435&epage=440&aulast=Fazio&aufirst=Patrik&auinit=P.&aufull=Fazio+P.&coden=NESCC&isbn=&pages=435-440&date=2013&auinit1=P&auinitm=";"Embase";"Yes";"";"";"yes";"";"";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Local Dynamic Stability (LDS), a non-linear gait stability index, has been advocated as an early indicator of risk for falls. With this longitudinal study over three weeks, we aimed to assess the responsiveness of Local Dynamic Stability to a rehabilitation program and to compare it to other measures. Eighteen patients (mean 54 years, median EDSS score: 5) participated. They were admitted to inpatient rehabilitation and received a three weeks individually tailored program. They performed a 3-minute walking test at the beginning and at the end of the stay, as well as pain, wellbeing, fatigue, and balance assessment. The Local Dynamic Stability was computed from the acceleration signals measured with a 3D-accelerometer. At the end of the rehabilitation process, patients reported reduced pain (Effect Size: -0.7), fatigue (ES:-0.6), and increased wellbeing (ES: 1.1). A small positive effect on static balance was observed (ES: 0.3). LDS was improved (ES: 0.6), and the effect was higher than walking speed improvement (ES: 0.4). The Local Dynamic Stability seemed responsive to assess rehabilitation effects in patients with multiple sclerosis. It could constitute a valuable gait quality index, which could evaluate potential effects of rehabilitation on fall risk.

Objective: This study aimed to determine the relation between real-life arm performance and clinical tests in MS. Methods: Thirty wheelchair-bound MS patients and 30 healthy controls were included. Actual and perceived real-life arm performance was measured by using accelerometry and a self-reported measure (Motor Activity Log). Clinical tests on 'body functions and structures' (JAMAR handgrip strength, Motricity Index (MI), Fugl Meyer (FM)) and 'activity' level (Nine Hole Peg Test (NHPT), Action Research Arm test) of the International Classification of Functioning were conducted. Statistical analyses were performed separately for current dominant and non-dominant arm. Results: For all outcome measures, MS patients scored with both arms significantly lower than the control group. Higher correlations between actual arm performance and clinical tests were found for the non-dominant arm (0.63-0.80). The FM (55%) was a good predictor of actual arm performance, while the MI (46%) and NHPT (55%) were good predictors of perceived arm performance. Conclusions: Real-life arm performance is decreased in wheelchair-bound MS patients and can be best predicted by measures on 'body functions and structures' level and fine motor control.

There further are unresolved methodological issues such as the appropriate mode (i.e., written or oral administration) and measure (e.g., Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) & the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT)) of cognitive assessment. This prospective study further examined methodological issues influencing the association between physical activity and IPS in 82 persons with MS. Methods Participants wore an accelerometer during the waking hours over 7 days for measuring physical activity as steps/day and six-months later completed two versions of the SDMT and the PASAT. Results Steps/day was significantly, moderately, and similarly associated with oral (r(s) =.45, p <.01) and written (r(s) =.51, p <.01) SDMT performance, but weakly associated with scores on the PASAT (r(s) =.23, p =.02). After controlling for age and disability status as covariates of IPS, the associations among steps/day and oral (pr(s) =.25, p =.02) and written (pr(s) =.29, p =.01) SDMT performance were attenuated, but statistically significant, whereas after controlling for age and disability status, the association between steps/day and PASAT performance was not statistically significant (pr(s) =.12, p =.34). Conclusions These results support inclusion of either oral or written administrations of the SDMT, rather than the PASAT, as measures of IPS in future physical activity interventions. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

One consequence of this disease is the emergence of enhanced tremor. This study was designed to (1) compare the tremor responses of persons with MS to that of healthy adults and to (2) examine the impact of whole body position (i.e., seated/standing) on tremor. Bilateral postural tremor was recorded using accelerometers attached to each index finger. Results revealed some similarity of tremor between groups in regard to the principal features (e.g., presence of peaks in similar frequency ranges). However, significant differences were observed with tremor for the MS persons being of greater amplitude, more regular (lower ApEn) and more strongly coupled across limbs compared to the elderly. The effects of body position were consistent across all subjects, with tremor increasing significantly from sitting-to-standing. However, the tremor increase for the MS group was greater than the elderly. Overall, the tremor for MS group was negatively affected by both this disease process and the nature of the task being performed. This latter result indicates that tremor does not simply reflect the feed-forward output of the neuromotor system but that it is influenced by the task constraints. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

To date, there is limited evidence regarding the validity of PDDS scores, despite its sound conceptual development and broad inclusion in MS research. This study examined the validity of the PDDS based on (1) the association with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores and (2) the pattern of associations between PDDS and EDSS scores with Functional System (FS) scores as well as ambulatory and other outcomes.Methods: 96 persons with MS provided demographic/clinical information, completed the PDDS and other PROs including the Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale-12 (MSWS-12), and underwent a neurological examination for generating FS and EDSS scores. Participants completed assessments of cognition, ambulation including the 6-minute walk (6 MW), and wore an accelerometer during waking hours over seven days.Results: There was a strong correlation between EDSS and PDDS scores (ρ = .783).

This requires development of a cut-point for interpreting the rate of accelerometer output based on its association with energy expenditure during physical activity. Objective The current study measured activity counts from a waist-worn accelerometer and energy expenditure based on indirect calorimetry during three speeds of over-ground walking for deriving cut-points for interpreting accelerometer output in persons with mild, moderate, and severe MS disability. Methods 54 participants with MS initially completed a neurological examination for generation of an EDSS score. Participants were then fitted with an ActiGraph model GT3X + accelerometer and a Cosmed portable metabolic system, and completed three, 6-minute walk (6 MW) tests that were interspersed with 10-15 min of rest. The first 6 MW was undertaken at a comfortable walking speed (CWS), and the two remaining 6 MW tests were undertaken above (faster walking speed) or below (slower walking speed) the participant's CWS in a counterbalanced order. Results The linear association between activity counts per minute and energy expenditure did not differ between persons with mild and moderate MS disability, but it was significantly different among persons with severe disability. This resulted in disability-specific cut-points for MVPA of 1980 and 1185 counts per minute for groups with mild/moderate disability and severe disability, respectively. Conclusions We believe that this research will facilitate a better understanding of time spent in MVPA across a broad range of MS disability. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Methods Eighty four participants with MS, without ocular disease or high myopia underwent a neurological examination for Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scoring, followed by OCT. Participants then wore an accelerometer during the waking hours of a 7-day period to objectively measure physical activity as steps/day. Results Mean RNFL thickness for the sample was 91.46 μm (SD=15.0), and mean TMV was 6.61 mm(3) (SD=0.5). The mean score from the accelerometer was 4287 steps/day (SD=2563). Steps/day was significantly associated with both RNFL thickness (Wald χ(2)= 46.48, p<0.001) and TMV (Wald χ(2)=1798.27, p<0.001).

The current investigation examined and compared the accuracy of the StepWatch activity monitor and ActiGraph model GT3X+ accelerometer for capturing steps taken during various speeds of prolonged, over-ground ambulation in persons with MS who had mild, moderate, and severe disability. Methods: Sixty-three persons with MS underwent a neurological examination for generation of an EDSS score and undertook two trials of walking on the GAITRite electronic walkway. Participants were fitted with accelerometers, and undertook three modified six-minute walk (6MW) tests that were interspersed with 10-15 minutes of rest. The first 6MW was undertaken at a comfortable walking speed (CWS), and the two remaining 6MW tests were undertaken above (faster walking speed; FWS) or below (slower walking speed; SWS) the participant's CWS. The actual number of steps taken was counted through direct observation using hand-tally counters. Results: The StepWatch activity monitor (99.8%-99.9%) and ActiGraph model GT3X+ accelerometer (95.6%-97.4%) both demonstrated highly accurate measurement of steps taken under CWS and FWS conditions. The StepWatch had better accuracy (99.0%) than the ActiGraph (95.5%) in the overall sample under the SWS condition, and this was particularly apparent in those with severe disability (StepWatch: 95.7%; ActiGraph: 87.3%). The inaccuracy in measurement for the ActiGraph was associated with alterations of gait (e.g., slower gait velocity, shorter step length, wider base of support). Conclusions: This research will help inform the choice of accelerometer to be adopted in clinical trials of MS wherein the monitoring of free-living walking behavior is of particular value. © 2014 Sandroff et al.";"Article";"10.1371/JOURNAL.PONE.0093511";"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=19326203&id=doi:10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0093511&atitle=Accuracy+of+StepWatch%E2%84%A2+and+ActiGraph+accelerometers+for+measuring+steps+taken+among+persons+with+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=PLoS+ONE&title=PLoS+ONE&volume=9&issue=4&spage=&epage=&aulast=Sandroff&aufirst=Brian+M.&auinit=B.M.&aufull=Sandroff+B.M.&coden=POLNC&isbn=&pages=-&date=2014&auinit1=B&auinitm=M";"Embase";"Yes";"";"";"yes";"";"";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Body-worn accelerometers and gyroscopes are able to detect gait and balance abnormalities in people with MS who have normal walking speeds. Few longitudinal studies exist using this technology to study the evolution of mobility deficits. The purpose of this study was to determine if body-worn sensors detected any decline in gait and balance measures in people with MS over time. Twenty-seven people with MS (13 mildly disabled, self-rated expanded disability status scale 0-3.5; 14 moderately disabled, SR-EDSS 4.0-5.5) who had normal walking speeds and 18 matched control subjects underwent gait and balance testing using body-worn sensors every 6 months for 18 months. While no parameter worsened over time, the moderately disabled MS cohort performed more poorly than the mildly disabled MS cohort who, in turn, was worse than control subjects for both objective and subjective walking and balance measures. Furthermore, the moderately disabled MS cohort demonstrated greater variation in between-visit performance than did the less disabled MS cohort or controls (Bonferroni-corrected p<. 0.05).

Contemporary methods to assess the level of physical activity in PwMS are regular clinical observation. However, these methods either rely on high recall and accurate reporting from the patients (e.g. self-report questionnaires), or they are conducted during a particular clinical assessment with predefined activities. Therefore, the main aim of this pilot study was to develop an objective method to gather information about the real type and intensity of daily activities performed by PwMS in every-day living situations using an accelerometer. Furthermore, the accelerometer-derived measures are investigated regarding their potential for discriminating between different MS groups. Methods: Eleven PwMS that were able to walk independently (EDSS ≤ 5) were divided into two groups: mild disability (EDSS 1-2.5; n = 6) and moderate disability (EDSS 3 -5; n = 5). Participants made use of an activity monitor device attached to their waist during their normal daily activities over 4 measurements. Activity parameters were assessed and compared for the time of each participant's first measurement and follow-up measurement. Furthermore, differences between both subgroups, and the correlation of activity parameters with the clinical neurological variable (EDSS) were investigated. Results: Participants showed significant decline in step count (p = 0.008), maximum walking speed (p = 0.02) and physical activity intensity (p = 0.03) throughout the study period. Compared to the mild subgroup, moderate affected participant accumulated less number of steps (G1: 9214.33 ± 2439.11, G2: 5018.13 ± 2416.96; p < 0.005) and were slower (G1: 1.48 ± 0.19, G2: 1.12 ± 0.44; p = 0.03). Additionally, the EDSS correlated negatively with mean walking speed (r = - 0.71, p = 0.01) and steps count (r = - 0.54, p = 0.08). Conclusions: In this study, we used a portable activity monitoring sensor to gather information about everyday physical activity in PwMS at home. We showed that objective measurements using simple 3D accelerometers can track daily physical activity fluctuation. Furthermore, they track disability changes better than clinical measures. Thus, they can help to develop activity based treatments for PwMS. © 2014 Shammas et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.";"Article";"10.1186/1475-925X-13-10";"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=1475925X&id=doi:10.1186%2F1475-925X-13-10&atitle=Home-based+system+for+physical+activity+monitoring+in+patients+with+multiple+sclerosis+%28Pilot+study%29&stitle=Biomed.+Eng.+Online&title=BioMedical+Engineering+Online&volume=13&issue=1&spage=&epage=&aulast=Shammas&aufirst=Layal&auinit=L.&aufull=Shammas+L.&coden=BEOIB&isbn=&pages=-&date=2014&auinit1=L&auinitm=";"Embase";"Yes";"";"";"yes";"";"";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

This study examined spasticity of the legs and its association with multiple measures of ambulation in persons with MS. Methods. The sample included 84 patients with MS. Spasticity of the legs was measured using a 5-point rating scale ranging between 0 (normal) and 4 (contracted). Patients completed the 6-minute walk (6 MW), timed 25 foot walk (T25FW), and timed up-and-go (TUG), and O(2) cost of walking was measured during the 6 MW. The patients undertook two walking trials on a GAITRite (CIR systems, Inc.) for measuring spatial and temporal parameters of gait. The patients completed the Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale-12 (MSWS-12) and wore an accelerometer over a seven-day period. Results. 52% (n=44) of the sample presented with spasticity of the legs. Those with leg spasticity had significantly worse ambulation as measured by 6 MW (P=0.0001, d=-0.86), T25FW (P=0.003,d=0.72), TUG (P=0.001, d=0.84), MSWS-12 (P=0.0001,d=1.09), O (2) cost of walking (P=0.001, d=0.75), average steps/day (P<0.05, d=-0.45), and walking velocity (P<0.05, d=-0.53) and cadence (P<0.05, d=-0.46).

Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: University medical center. Participants: Persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) (n=40) were compared with similar aged control subjects (n=20). There were 20 subjects with MS in the normal walking velocity group and 20 subjects with MS who had slow walking velocity based on a timed 25-foot walk (T25FW) of <5 seconds. Interventions: None. Main Outcome Measures: Postural response latency, sway variables, trunk motion variables. Results: We found that subjects with MS with both slow or normal walking velocities had significantly longer postural response latencies than the healthy control group. Postural response latency was not correlated with the T25FW. Postural response latency was significantly correlated with center of pressure sway variables during quiet standing (root mean square: rho=.334, P=.04; range: rho=.385, P=.017; mean velocity: rho=.337, P=.038; total sway area: rho=.393, P=.015). Postural response latency was also significantly correlated with motion of the trunk during walking (sagittal plane range of motion: rho=.316, P=.05; SD of transverse plane range of motion: rho=-.43, P=.006).

"279";"Carpinella I., Cattaneo D., Ferrarin M.";"Quantitative assessment of upper limb motor function in Multiple Sclerosis using an instrumented Action Research Arm Test";"Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation";2014;"Background: Arm impairment in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is commonly assessed with clinical scales, such as Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) which evaluates the ability to handle and transport smaller and larger objects. ARAT provides a complete upper limb assessment, as it considers both proximal arm and hand, but suffers from subjectivity and poor sensitivity to mild impairment. In this study an instrumented ARAT is proposed to overcome these limitations and supplement the assessment of arm function in MS. Methods. ARAT was executed by 12 healthy volunteers and 21 MS subjects wearing a single inertial sensor on the wrist. Accelerometers and gyroscopes signals were used to calculate the duration of each task and its sub-phases (reaching, manipulation, transport, release and return). A jerk index was computed to quantify movement smoothness. For each parameter, z-scores were calculated to analyze the deviation from normative data. MS subjects were clinically assessed with ARAT score, Nine-Hole Peg test (9HPT) and Fahn Tremor Rating Scale (FTRS). Results: ARAT tasks executed by MS patients were significantly slower (duration increase: 70%) and less smooth (jerk increase: 16%) with respect to controls. These anomalies were mainly related to manipulation, transport and release sub-movements, with the former showing the greatest alterations. A statistically significant decrease in movement velocity and smoothness was also noticed in patients with normal ARAT score. Z-scores related to duration and jerk were strongly correlated with ARAT rating (r < -0.80, p < 0.001) and 9HPT (r < -0.75, p < 0.001) and were significantly different among MS sub-groups with different levels of arm impairments (p < 0.001). Moreover, Z-score related to manipulation-phase jerk was significantly correlated with the FTRS rating of intention tremor (r = 0.84, p < 0.001). Conclusions: The present study showed that the proposed method is able to discriminate between control and MS groups and to reveal subtle arm alterations not detectable from ARAT score. Validity was shown by high correlations between instrumental variables and clinical ratings. These results suggested that instrumented ARAT could be a valid quick and easy-to-use method for a sensitive quantification of arm function in MS.

This study compared physical activity level (PAL) and recovery of upper limb muscle function following exercise between MS patients and healthy inactive controls. Furthermore, the relationship between PAL and muscle recovery was examined. Methods PAL of 19 MS patients and 32 controls was measured using an accelerometer for 7 consecutive days. Afterwards, recovery of muscle function was assessed by performing a fatiguing upper limb exercise test with subsequent recovery measures. Results Muscle recovery of the upper limb muscles was similar in both groups. Average activity counts were significantly lower in MS patients than in the control group. MS patients spent significantly more time being sedentary and less time on activities of moderate intensity compared with the control group. No significant correlation between PAL and recovery of muscle function was found in MS patients. Conclusions Recovery of upper limb muscle function following exercise is normal in MS patients.

This has motivated the search for variables that act as determinants of physical activity. Such variables are derived from theory and presumably represent targets of behavioral interventions for increasing physical activity.PURPOSE: This prospective, observational study examined variables from social cognitive theory as determinants of physical activity 6 weeks later in persons with RRMS.METHODS: Persons (N = 68) with RRMS initially completed a questionnaire battery that included measures of self-efficacy, physical, social, and self-evaluative outcome expectations, functional limitations as an impediment, social support as a facilitator, and goal setting for physical activity. The participants wore an accelerometer and completed a self-reported physical activity measure 6 weeks later.

This study examined the validity of those MCID values based on capturing corresponding changes in other walking outcomes in persons with multiple sclerosis (MS). Methods: On 2 occasions separated by 6 months, 82 persons with MS completed the MSWS-12, timed 25-ft walk (T25FW), 6-min walk (6MW), and gait analysis, and then wore an accelerometer over a 7-day period. We generated change scores for the MSWS-12 and formed groups of stable, worsened, and improved perceived walking based on both 4- and 6-point changes. The groups were compared for corresponding changes in other walking measures over time using mixed-model ANOVAs. Results: The mixed-model ANOVAs did not identify statistically significant group-by-time interactions on the T25FW (p = 0.98 and p = 0.67), the 6MW (p = 0.89 and p = 0.72), gait (p = 0.54 and p = 0.21), or accelerometry (p = 0.40 and p = 0.68) for MCID values of 4- or 6-point changes in MSWS-12 scores.

Even though there are several tools available to quantify ambulatory behavior in a home environment, reliable measurement of joint motion is still limited to laboratory tests. The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a novel inertial sensor system for ambulatory behavior and joint motion measurement in the everyday environment. An algorithm for behavior classification, step detection, and knee angle calculation was developed. The validation protocol consisted of simulated daily activities in a laboratory environment. The tests were performed with ten healthy subjects and eleven patients with multiple sclerosis. Activity classification showed comparable performance to commercially available activPAL sensors. Step detection with our sensor system was more accurate. The calculated flexion-extension angle of the knee joint showed a root mean square error of less than 5° compared with results obtained using an electro-mechanical goniometer. This new system combines ambulatory behavior assessment and knee angle measurement for long-term measurement periods in a home environment.

Accelerometric (ACC) and electromyographic (EMG) recordings were performed in 26 MS patients complaining of clumsiness, associated (n= 16) or not associated (n= 10) with visible tremor. Seventeen healthy subjects with physiological tremor (PT) and eight patients with essential tremor (ET) served as controls. Signals were analyzed using non-linear Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and related Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT), compared to the standard linear spectral analysis using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The presence of cerebellar signs and motor deficit was assessed on clinical examination. Using FFT, tremor was found in all patients with ET and 12% of subjects with PT, but in none of the MS patients, even in the presence of visible tremor. In contrast, EMD-HHT analysis of ACC-EMG coupling showed common frequency peaks characterizing tremor related to a central generator in 62.5% of MS patients with visible tremor, 40% of MS patients without visible tremor, 29% of subjects with PT, and all patients with ET. In EMD-HHT analysis, tremor characteristics were similar in subjects with PT and MS patients, regardless of the presence of a visible tremor, but these characteristics clearly differed in patients with ET. A visible tremor in MS patients was associated with more frequent cerebellar signs and less motor deficit at the upper limb. The low-frequency tremor observed in MS patients could therefore originate in lesions of the brainstem (midbrain) or cerebellothalamic circuits, or may correspond to an enhanced PT, partly favored by cerebellar dysfunction and being more visible during movement execution in the absence of concomitant motor deficit.";"Article";"10.1016/J.NEUCLI.2015.09.013";"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=17697131&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.neucli.2015.09.013&atitle=Analysis+of+tremor+in+multiple+sclerosis+using+Hilbert-Huang+Transform&stitle=Neurophysiol.+Clin.&title=Neurophysiologie+Clinique&volume=45&issue=6&spage=475&epage=484&aulast=Ayache&aufirst=S.-S.&auinit=S.-S.&aufull=Ayache+S.-S.&coden=NCLIE&isbn=&pages=475-484&date=2015&auinit1=S&auinitm=-S";"Embase";"Yes";"";"";"no";"Out of scope";"";"Included";"";"Out of scope (outcomes)";"";"in"

Instrumented measurement of standing postural sway with inertial motion sensors may provide sensitive measures of balance impairment and better correspond with patient reports. Methods: While wearing wireless inertial sensors, 20 subjects with MS - Expanded Disability Status Scale of less than 3.0 and a Timed 25 Foot Walk of 5 sec or less - and 20 age- and sex-matched control subjects stood with eyes open and eyes closed on a foam surface. Forty-six outcome measures of postural sway were derived. A stepwise logistic regression model determined which measures of instrumented sway provide independent predictors of group status. Subjects with MS also completed the Activities-Specific Balance Confidence (ABC) scale and the 12-Item MS Walking Scale (MSWS-12) as measures of subject-reported balance and mobility impairment. Results: The regression model identified medio-lateral sway path length and medio-lateral range of sway acceleration amplitude, each in the eyes-open condition, as the only two significant independent predictors to differentiate subjects with MS from those without MS (model chi-squared∈=∈34.55, p∈<∈0.0001): accuracy∈=∈87.5 %, positive likelihood ratio∈=∈6 (2.09-17.21), negative likelihood ratio∈=∈0.12 (0.03-0.44).

There are several studies about factors affecting physical activity in pwMS. However, these factors have not investigated in minimally impaired pwMS who do not have remarkable symptoms and walking disturbance. The objective was to determine factors affecting physical activity in minimally impaired pwMS. Patients and Methods: We recruited 52 minimally impaired pwMS and measured physical activity with Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ) and an accelerometer used for the 7-day period. Demographic data were recorded. Walking (speed, endurance, dexterity, and quality), fatigue, depression, and quality of life were measured.

Results: The walking speed assessed by the Timed 25-Foot Walk and gender were found the determinants of physical activity level assessed by the GLTEQ and accelerometer, respectively. Walking (speed, endurance, and dexterity), gender, employment status, and quality of life were associated with physical activity. Either female or unemployed participants had significantly less physical activity. There were no significant difference between physical activity levels and the other subgroups.

ANOVA were used to evaluate the effects of testing session on the Brief-BESTest, instrumented stance and gait recordings by inertial motion sensors, lower-limb strength recorded by force transducers, accelerometry-based activity, the 12-item MS Walking Scale (MSWS-12), the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 (MSQOL-54) questionnaire, the Modified Fatigue Impact scale (MFIS) and the Activity-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) scale.RESULTS: The intervention associated with significantly improved scores on the MSQOL-54 mental component, MFIS, MSWS-12 and Brief-BESTest. Sway amplitude significantly decreased and jerk significantly increased during instrumented standing on foam with eyes closed. Instrumented gait recordings of sagittal trunk range of motion also significantly decreased. ABC scores, strength measures and activity measures were not significantly changed.CONCLUSIONS: Ten weeks of functional balance exercises provided a feasible intervention for individuals with MS that improved components of balance, mental well-being and perceived fatigue impact and ambulation disability. A future randomized, controlled clinical trial should confirm these preliminary findings. Implications for Rehabilitation A balance-specific exercise program is both safe and feasible for individuals with mild-to-moderate MS. Comprehensive exercise interventions that are conceptually driven and employ well-designed progressive exercise across multiple contexts of balance control can facilitate improvements in balance impairments associated with MS.

Methods: Thirty-eight participant pairs (MS and cohabitant) aged 18-55 years participated in the study. Each participant received an Android HTC Sensation 4G smartphone containing a custom application suite of 19 tests capturing participant performance and patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Over 1 year, participants were prompted daily to complete one assigned test. Results: A total of 22 patients with MS and 17 cohabitants completed the entire study. Among patients with MS, low scores on PROs relating tomental and visual function were associated with dropout (p < 0.05). We illustrate several novel features of a smartphone platform. First, fluctuations in MS outcomes (e.g., fatigue) were assessed against an individual's ambient environment by linking responses to meteorological data. Second, both response accuracy and speed for the Ishihara color vision test were captured, highlighting the benefits of both active and passive data collection. Third, a new trait, a person-specific learning curve in neuropsychological testing, was identified using spline analysis. Finally, averaging repeated measures over the study yielded the most robust correlation matrix of the different outcome measures.

To date, this assessment has not been subject to the same rigor and extent of psychometric evaluation as other widely-accepted measures of ambulatory (e.g., timed 25-foot walk (T25FW)). Objective: This study aimed to provide additional validity evidence for the SSST in 96 persons with MS, based on construct validity and precision. Construct validity involves examining the pattern of associations between the SSST and other measures, and precision involves comparing SSST performance relative to other valid measures of ambulation for differentiating between levels of disability status, MS clinical course, and fall risk based on balance confidence. Methods: All participants completed the SSST, T25FW, Timed Up-and-Go (TUG), six-minute walk, Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale-12, Late-Life Function and Disability Inventory, Activities-specific Balance Confidence, and Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test. All participants further underwent a neurological examination for generating EDSS scores, and then wore an ActiGraph accelerometer for the waking hours of a 7-day period. Results: SSST performance was strongly associated with other valid measures of ambulation (|ρ| = .65-.90) and disability status (ρ=.73), moderately-to-strongly associated with balance confidence (ρ=.58), and weakly-to-moderately associated with cognitive processing speed and non-ambulatory measures (|ρ| = .35-.39). The SSST demonstrated stronger relative precision in discriminating between levels of disability status, MS clinical course, and fall risk based on balance confidence than the T25FW and TUG.

Approach. HHT was applied on gyroscope data collected on 20 MS subjects and 13 healthy controls (CO) during finger-to-nose tests (FNTs) instrumented with an inertial sensor placed on the hand. The results were compared to those obtained after traditional linear filtering. The tremor amplitude was quantified with instrumental indexes (TIs) and clinical FTRS ratings. Main results. The TIs computed after HHT-based filtering discriminated between CO and MS subjects with clinically-detected intention tremor (MS-T). In particular, TIs were significantly higher in the final part of the movement (TI<inf>2</inf>) with respect to the first part (TI<inf>1</inf>), and, for all components (X, Y, Z), MS-T showed a TI<inf>2</inf> significantly higher than in CO subjects. Moreover, the HHT detected subtle alterations not visible from clinical ratings, as TI<inf>2</inf> (Z-component) was significantly increased in MS subjects without clinically-detected tremor (MS-NT). The method's validity was demonstrated by significant correlations between clinical FTRS scores and TI<inf>2</inf> related to X (r<inf>s</inf> = 0.587, p = 0.006) and Y (r<inf>s</inf> = 0.682, p < 0.001) components. Contrarily, fewer differences among the groups and no correlation between instrumental and clinical indexes emerged after traditional filtering. Significance. The present results supported the use of the HHT-based procedure for a fully-automated quantitative and objective measure of intention tremor in MS, which can overcome the limitations of clinical scales and provide supplementary information about this sign.";"Article";"10.1088/1741-2560/12/4/046011";"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=17412552&id=doi:10.1088%2F1741-2560%2F12%2F4%2F046011&atitle=Hilbert-Huang+transform+based+instrumental+assessment+of+intention+tremor+in+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=J.+Neural+Eng.&title=Journal+of+Neural+Engineering&volume=12&issue=4&spage=&epage=&aulast=Carpinella&aufirst=Ilaria&auinit=I.&aufull=Carpinella+I.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2015&auinit1=I&auinitm=";"Embase";"Yes";"";"";"no";"Out of scope";"";"Included";"";"included";"tremor hand acc correlated with FTRS";NA

However, the manner in which daily activity is accumulated is currently unknown in this population. Methods: A secondary analysis was performed on a combined data set of persons with MS from two previous investigations of physical activity and symptomatic or quality of life outcomes in the United States over a two year period (2007-2009). Mobility disability status was determined using the Patient Determined Disease Steps (PDDS) while activity behavior was objectively monitored using an ActiGraph accelerometer for 7. days. Results: Persons with MS who have mobility disability were involved in sedentary behavior, light and moderate intensity activity for 65%, 34% and 1% of the day, respectively compared to 60%, 37%, and 3%, respectively in those without mobility disability (p<. 0.05).

Purpose: This study examined the association between levels of physical activity and brain volumetric measures from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in MS. Method: 39 persons with MS wore an accelerometer for a 7-day period and underwent a brain MRI. Normalized GM volume (NGMV), normalized WM volume (NWMV), and deep GM structures were calculated from 3D T1-weighted structural brain images. We conducted partial correlations (pr) controlling for demographic and clinical variables.

Design Randomized controlled trial, 3-month postintervention follow-up. Setting Home and general community, and university research laboratory. Participants Nonambulatory individuals with MS (N=14; mean age ± SD, 53.6±8.7y) were randomly assigned to an intervention group (IG) or a control group (CG). Interventions After baseline testing, the IG participants received custom-fit, ultralightweight manual wheelchairs with propulsion/skills training, followed by 3 months of at-home use with the custom ultralightweight wheelchair and weekly phone calls to deliver support through a multifactorial intervention. The CG participants received no training and used their own wheelchairs at home during this time. Main Outcome Measures All subjects were assessed at baseline and 3 months later for fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale), upper extremity strength (digital handheld dynamometer), and propulsion technique (on a treadmill [0.5m/s] with instrumented wheels). Two 1-week bouts of physical activity were measured in both groups from home with wrist-worn accelerometry at the beginning (IG and CG in own wheelchairs) and end (IG in study wheelchair, CG in own) of the 3-month period of home use. Results The intervention was well tolerated, and no adverse events were reported. The IG demonstrated increased strength (P=.008) and a trend toward less fatigue (P=.068), both with large effect sizes (d>0.8), as well as reduced application of braking torque during propulsion (P=.003) with a moderate/large effect size (d=.73), compared with the CG.

"346";"Sandroff B.M., Klaren R.E., Motl R.W.";"Relationships among physical inactivity, deconditioning, and walking impairment in persons with multiple sclerosis";"Journal of neurologic physical therapy : JNPT";2015;"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We have previously proposed a conceptual model of physical inactivity, physiological deconditioning, and walking impairment in persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) that suggests engaging in physical activity and improving physiological conditioning may lead to improvements in walking performance. This cross-sectional study examined the nature of associations among physical activity, aerobic capacity, and walking performance in persons with MS and healthy controls.METHODS: The sample included 31 persons with MS and 31 controls matched by age, sex, height, and weight. Participants completed the 6-minute walk (6MW), wore an ActiGraph model GT3X accelerometer for 7 days as an objective measure of physical activity (expressed as time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity [MVPA]), and completed an incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer as a measure of aerobic capacity (VO2peak).RESULTS: Hierarchical linear regression analyses indicated that MVPA and VO2peak partially explained group differences in 6MW performance (R = 0.782), although group remained a significant predictor of 6MW performance (β = 0.304; P < 0.001). Path analysis indicated that group had both statistically significant direct and indirect effects on 6MW performance, and the indirect effect operated through pathways involving MVPA and VO2peak.DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: These results provide direct preliminary evidence that physiological deconditioning, perhaps occurring as a result of physical inactivity, may explain variability in walking impairment in persons with MS. These findings support the design and implementation of targeted interventions for improving walking impairment in this population.VIDEO ABSTRACT AVAILABLE: for more insights from the authors (see Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A93).";"Article";"10.1097/NPT.0000000000000087";"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=15570584&id=doi:10.1097%2FNPT.0000000000000087&atitle=Relationships+among+physical+inactivity%2C+deconditioning%2C+and+walking+impairment+in+persons+with+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=J+Neurol+Phys+Ther&title=Journal+of+neurologic+physical+therapy+%3A+JNPT&volume=39&issue=2&spage=103&epage=110&aulast=Sandroff&aufirst=Brian+M.&auinit=B.M.&aufull=Sandroff+B.M.&coden=&isbn=&pages=103-110&date=2015&auinit1=B&auinitm=M";"Embase";"Yes";"";"";"yes";"";"";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

However, gait variability's link to falls in persons with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS) is not well established. This investigation examined the relationship between stride-time variability, fall risk, and physiological fall risk factors in PwMS. 17 PwMS (62.8±7.4 years) and 17 age-matched controls (62.8±5.9 years) performed the 6-minute walk test. Stride-time was assessed with accelerometers attached to the participants' shanks. Stride-time variability was measured by interstride coefficient of variation (CV) of stride-time. The participant's fall risk was measured by the short form physiological profile assessment (PPA). A Spearman correlation analysis was used to determine the relationship between variables. Increased fall risk was strongly associated with increased stride-time CV in both PwMS (?=0.71, p<0.01) and the controls (?=0.67, p<0.01). Fall risk was not correlated with average stride-time (p>0.05). In PwMS, stride-time CV was related to postural sway (?=0.74, p<0.01) while in the control group, it was related to proprioception (?=0.61, p<0.01) and postural sway (?=0.78, p<0.01). Current observations suggest that gait variability is maybe more sensitive marker of fall risk than average gait parameters in PwMS.

We performed accelerometric (ACC) and electromyographic (EMG) assessment of tremor in 32MS patientswithmanual clumsiness. In addition to clinical examination, patients underwent a neurophysiological exploration of the brainstemand cerebellar functions,which consisted of blink and masseter inhibitory reflexes, cerebello-thalamo-cortical inhibition (CTCi), and somatosensory evoked potentials. Tremor was clinically visible in 18 patients and absent in 14. Patients with visible tremor had more severe score of ataxia and clinical signs of cerebellar dysfunction, as well as a more reduced CTCi on neurophysiological investigation. However, ACC and EMG recordings confirmed the presence of a real rhythmic activity in only one patient. In most MS patients, the clinically visible tremor corresponded to a pseudorhythmic activity without coupling between ACC and EMG recordings.

Objective: This study examined the accuracy and precision of common smartphone applications and motion sensors for measuring steps taken by MS patients while walking on a treadmill. Methods: Forty-five MS patients (Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) = 1.0–5.0) underwent two 500-step walking trials at comfortable walking speed on a treadmill. Participants wore five motion sensors: the Digi-Walker SW-200 pedometer (Yamax), the UP2 and UP Move (Jawbone), and the Flex and One (Fitbit). The smartphone applications were Health (Apple), Health Mate (Withings), and Moves (ProtoGeo Oy). Results: The Fitbit One had the best absolute (mean = 490.6 steps, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 485.6–495.5 steps) and relative accuracy (1.9% error), and absolute (SD = 16.4) and relative precision (coefficient of variation (CV) = 0.0), for the first 500-step walking trial; this was repeated with the second trial. Relative accuracy was correlated with slower walking speed for the first (r(s) = −.53) and second (r(s) = −.53) trials. Conclusion: The results suggest that the waist-worn Fitbit One is the most precise and accurate sensor for measuring steps when walking on a treadmill, but future research is needed (testing the device across a broader range of disability, at different speeds, and in real-life walking conditions) before inclusion in clinical research and practice with MS patients.";"Article";"10.1177/2055217316634754";"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=20552173&id=doi:10.1177%2F2055217316634754&atitle=Accuracy+and+precision+of+smartphone+applications+and+commercially+available+motion+sensors+in+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.+Exp.+Transl.+Clin.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal+-+Experimental%2C+Translational+and+Clinical&volume=2&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Balto&aufirst=Julia+M&auinit=J.M.&aufull=Balto+J.M.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2016&auinit1=J&auinitm=M";"Embase";"Yes";"";"";"yes";"";"";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Methods One hundred and five pwMS (Expanded Disability Status Scale, EDSS in the range 0–6.5) classified in three sub-groups (EDSS 0–1.5, EDSS 2–4, EDSS 4.5–6.5) and 47 healthy controls (HC) participated in the study. All the subjects were evaluated with the timed 25-foot walking test (T25FW) while wearing a commercially available accelerometer. PwMS also rated the impact of the disease on their walking abilities using the 12-item MS walking scale (MSWS-12). Results All parameters objectively measured, except stride length, were significantly modified in pwMS with higher EDSS, with respect to HC and lower disability participants. Moderate to high correlations (r =0.57–0.79) were observed between gait parameters and MSWS-12 for pwMS of higher EDSS. The correlation was found moderate for the intermediate EDSS category (r =0.42–0.62). Conclusion Wearable accelerometers are a useful tool for assessing gait performance for pwMS in a clinical setting, especially in cases of mild to moderate disability.

The impact on habitual mobility and its correlation with clinical tests has not been analysed. Objective To investigate the association between clinical response criteria and habitual mobility in MS patients starting a fampridine treatment. Methods During a four-week baseline-to-treatment study, we assessed in 28 patients (median EDSS 4.75, range 4–6.5) walking tests as the Timed-25-Foot-Walk (T25FW) and mobility questionnaires at day 0, 14 (start of treatment) and 28. Habitual steps and distance per day, total activity and walking speed was measured by accelerometry over four weeks. Beside improvement in real-life mobility, we investigated if such measures differed between non-responders and responders defined by a 20% improvement in clinical tests. Results All clinical test, patient reported outcomes and total activity improved significantly (p < 0.05). 46% improved (any change > 0) in three of four real-life measures. Change of the T25FW predicted only an increase of distance per day. Subjective rating of patients performed better by predicting distance and walking speed changes correctly.

However, many health benefits have not been realised because of issues with data quality that results from gravitational ‘cross-talk’ when the wearable device is tilted. Here we present an adaptive filter designed to improve the quality of accelerometer data prior to measuring dynamic pelvic sway patterns during a six minute walk test in people with and without Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Optical motion capture was used as the gold standard. Improved wearable device accuracy (?4.4% NRMSE) was achieved using gyroscopic corrections and scaling filter thresholds by step frequency. The people with MS presented significantly greater pelvis sway range to compensate for their lower limb weaknesses and joint contractures. The visualisation of asymmetric pelvic sway in people with MS illustrates the potential to better understand their mobility impairments for reducing fall risk.";"Article";"10.1080/10255842.2016.1140747";"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14768259&id=doi:10.1080%2F10255842.2016.1140747&atitle=Gyroscopic+corrections+improve+wearable+sensor+data+prior+to+measuring+dynamic+sway+in+the+gait+of+people+with+Multiple+Sclerosis&stitle=Comput.+Methods+Biomech.+Biomed.+Eng.&title=Computer+Methods+in+Biomechanics+and+Biomedical+Engineering&volume=19&issue=12&spage=1339&epage=1346&aulast=Brodie&aufirst=Matthew+A.+D.&auinit=M.A.D.&aufull=Brodie+M.A.D.&coden=&isbn=&pages=1339-1346&date=2016&auinit1=M&auinitm=A.D.";"Embase";"No";"Out of scope (outcomes)/Teamdiscussion";"";"yes";"";"";"Included";"";"included";"";NA

However, there is very little known about physical activity participation in older adults with conditions such as MS. This study compared levels of physical activity (i.e., sedentary behavior, light physical activity (LPA), and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA)) and rates of meeting public health guidelines for MVPA (i.e., ≥30 min/day) among young (i.e., ages 20-39 years), middle-aged (i.e., ages 40-59 years) and older adults (i.e., ages ≥60 years) with MS. The sample included 963 persons with MS who provided demographic and clinical information and wore an accelerometer for a 7-day period. The primary analysis involved a between-subjects ANOVA on accelerometer variables (i.e., accelerometer wear time; number of valid days; sedentary behavior in min/day; LPA in min/day; and MVPA in min/day). Collectively, our data indicated that older adults with MS engaged in less MVPA and more sedentary behavior than middle-aged and young adults with MS.

A Randomized Parallel Group Trial";"Physiotherapy research international : the journal for researchers and clinicians in physical therapy";2016;"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The most effective treatment approach to improve walking in people with multiple sclerosis (MS) is not known. The aim of this trial was to assess the efficacy of treadmill training and progressive strength training on walking in people with MS.METHODS: A single blinded randomized parallel group trial was carried out. Eligible participants were adults with MS with Expanded Disability Status Scale score ?6. A total of 29 participants were randomized and 28 received the allocated exercise intervention, treadmill (n?=?13) or strength training (n?=?15). Both groups exercised 30?minutes, three times a week for 8?weeks. Primary outcome was The Functional Ambulation Profile evaluated by the GAITRite walkway. Secondary outcomes were walking work economy and balance control during walking, measured by a small lightweight accelerometer connected to the lower back. Testing was performed at baseline and the subsequent week after completion of training.RESULTS: Two participants were lost to follow-up, and 11 (treadmill) and 15 (strength training) were left for analysis. The treadmill group increased their Functional Ambulation Profile score significantly compared with the strength training group (p?=?.037). A significant improvement in walking work economy (p?=?.024) and a reduction of root mean square of vertical acceleration (p?=?.047) also favoured the treadmill group.DISCUSSION: The results indicate that task-specific training by treadmill walking is a favourable approach compared with strength training to improve walking in persons with mild and moderate MS. Implications for Physiotherapy practice, this study adds knowledge for the decision of optimal treatment approaches in people with MS.

However, assessment of gait speed in coordination with delivery of comprehensive care is usually constrained to clinical environments and is often limited due to mounting demands on the availability of trained clinical staff. These limitations in assessment design could give rise to poor ecological validity and limited ability to tailor interventions to individual patients. Recent advances in wearable sensor technologies have fostered the development of new methods for monitoring parameters that characterize mobility impairment, such as gait speed, outside the clinic, and therefore address many of the limitations associated with clinical assessments. However, these methods are often validated using normal gait patterns; and extending their utility to subjects with gait impairments continues to be a challenge. In this paper, we present a machine learning method for estimating gait speed using a configurable array of skin-mounted, conformal accelerometers. We establish the accuracy of this technique on treadmill walking data from subjects with normal gait patterns and subjects with multiple sclerosis-induced gait impairments. For subjects with normal gait, the best performing model systematically overestimates speed by only 0.01 m/s, detects changes in speed to within less than 1%, and achieves a root-mean-square-error of 0.12 m/s. Extending these models trained on normal gait to subjects with gait impairments yields only minor changes in model performance. For example, for subjects with gait impairments, the best performing model systematically overestimates speed by 0.01 m/s, quantifies changes in speed to within 1%, and achieves a root-mean-square-error of 0.14 m/s. Additional analyses demonstrate that there is no correlation between gait speed estimation error and impairment severity, and that the estimated speeds maintain the clinical significance of ground truth speed in this population. These results support the use of wearable accelerometer arrays for estimating walking speed in normal subjects and their extension to MS patient cohorts with gait impairment.";"Article";"10.1371/JOURNAL.PONE.0178366";"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=19326203&id=doi:10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0178366&atitle=A+machine+learning+approach+for+gait+speed+estimation+using+skin-mounted+wearable+sensors%3A+From+healthy+controls+to+individuals+with+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=PLoS+ONE&title=PLoS+ONE&volume=12&issue=6&spage=&epage=&aulast=McGinnis&aufirst=Ryan+S.&auinit=R.S.&aufull=McGinnis+R.S.&coden=POLNC&isbn=&pages=-&date=2017&auinit1=R&auinitm=S";"Embase";"Yes";"";"";"yes";"";"";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Clinical tools and instrumental techniques are available for testing static and dynamic balance, but the relationship between such abilities is still not clear. Having information about this link would be important in properly planning the type and number of tests to administer. Methods One hundred and six pwMS (Expanded Disability Status Scale, EDSS 0−6.5) stratified in three sub-groups (Class 1 EDSS 0–1.5, Class 2 EDSS 2–4 and Class 3 EDSS 4.5–6.5) and 42 healthy controls (HC) participated in the study. All underwent static posturography and instrumented Timed-Up-and-Go (TUG) performed using a wearable inertial sensor. Raw data were processed to extract postural sway features, overall duration of TUG and its main sub-phases (i.e. sit-to-stand, 180° turns and stand-to-sit). Results All sway parameters of pwMS of Classes 2 and 3, as well as total TUG duration and time necessary to perform 180° turns, were found significantly higher than HC and Class 1 participants. However, poor correlations were found between sway and TUG parameters. When pwMS are grouped, small/moderate correlations (in the range 0.20–0.41) were found between all sway parameters and total TUG duration. Conclusions Static and dynamic balance in pwMS appear scarcely correlated, although both worsen as disability increases.

Behaviour change interventions may assist people with MS to increase physical activity and reduce sedentary behaviour. However, few studies have investigated their effectiveness using objective measures of physical activity, particularly in the long term. Further, interventions that have proven effective in the short term may not be feasible in clinical practice because of the large amount of support provided. The iStep-MS trial aims to determine the safety, feasibility and acceptability of a behaviour change intervention to increase physical activity and reduce sedentary behaviour among people with MS. Methods and analysis Sixty people with MS will be randomised (1:1 ratio) to receive a 12-week intervention or usual care only. The intervention consists of four physical activity consultations with a physiotherapist supported by a handbook and pedometer. Outcomes assessed at baseline, 12 weeks and 9 months are physical activity (ActiGraph wGT3X-BT accelerometer), sedentary behaviour (activPAL3μ), self-reported activity and sitting time, walking capability, fatigue, self-efficacy, participation, quality of life and health service use. The safety of the intervention will be determined by assessing change in pain and fatigue and the incidence of adverse events during the follow-up period. A parallel process evaluation will assess the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention through assessment of fidelity to the programme and semistructured interviews exploring participants' and therapists' experiences of the intervention. The feasibility of conducting an economic evaluation will be determined by collecting data on quality of life and resource use. Ethics and dissemination Research ethics committee approval has been granted from Brunel University London. Results of the trial will be submitted for publication in journals and distributed to people with MS and physiotherapists. Trial registration number ISRCTN15343862 (doi 10.1186/ISRCTN15343862).

Wireless inertial sensors can accurately measure numerous walking and balance parameters but these measures require evaluation of reliability in PwMS. The current study determined the test-retest reliability of wireless inertial sensor measures obtained during an instrumented standing balance test and an instrumented Timed Up and Go test in PwMS. Methods: Fifteen PwMS and 15 healthy control subjects (HC) performed an instrumented standing balance and instrumented Timed Up and Go (TUG) test on two separate days. Ten instrumented standing balance measures and 18 instrumented TUG measures were computed from the wireless sensor data. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated to determine test-retest reliability of all instrumented standing balance and instrumented TUG measures. Correlations were evaluated between the instrumented standing balance and instrumented TUG measures and self-reported walking and balance performance, fall history, and clinical disability. Results: For both groups, ICCs for instrumented standing balance measures were best for spatio-temporal measures, while frequency measures were less reliable. All instrumented TUG measures exhibited good to excellent (ICCs > 0.60) test-retest reliability in PwMS and in HC. There were no correlations between self-report walking and balance scores and instrumented TUG or instrumented standing balance metrics, but there were correlations between instrumented TUG and instrumented standing balance metrics and fall history and clinical disability status. Conclusions: Measures from the instrumented standing balance and instrumented TUG tests exhibit good to excellent reliability, demonstrating their potential as objective assessments for clinical trials.

This study investigated PA levels in persons with MS as a function of fall risk categories. Forty-seven persons with MS participated in the study and were categorized into either increased fall risk (IFR; n = 21; 55.5 ± 9.0 years) or normal fall risk (NFR; n = 26; 51.2 ± 12.9 years) groups based on scores from the Activities-Balance Confidence scale. PA was measured by accelerometer and expressed as average steps per day, and time spent in sedentary behavior, light PA, and moderate to vigorous physical activity over the course of 7 consecutive days. Univariate and covariate analyses were used to compare the differences in PA between fall risk groups. The average steps per day of the NFR group was significant higher compared with the IFR group (6024 ± 2533.1 vs. 2599 ± 1622.7 steps; P < 0.001), and the difference remained after controlling for disability level (5351 ± 2298.6 vs. 3432 ± 2363.6 steps; P = 0.016). There were no differences in light PA and moderate to vigorous physical activity between groups after controlling for disability level.

Methods Seven days of activity monitor data were collected for 26 participants with MS (age = 44.5 ± 11.9 years; time since diagnosis = 6.5 ± 6.2 years; Patient Determined Disease Steps = ≤3). Mean daily step count and mean daily EE (kcal) were calculated for all combinations of days (127 combinations), and compared to the respective 7-day mean daily step count or mean daily EE using intra-class correlations (ICC), the Generalizability Theory and Bland-Altman. Results For step count, ICC values of 0.94–0.98 and a G-coefficient of 0.81 indicate a minimum of any random 2-day combination is required to reliably calculate mean daily step count. For EE, ICC values of 0.96–0.99 and a G-coefficient of 0.83 indicate a minimum of any random 4-day combination is required to reliably calculate mean daily EE.

METHODS: Forty-seven persons with MS completed the Activities-Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale and underwent a battery of assessments of mobility, balance, and cognition. Participants further wore an accelerometer for 7 days as an assessment of steps/day. Participants were allocated into fall risk groups based on ABC scale scores (increased fall risk (IFR); and normal fall risk (NFR)). We examined univariate differences between groups using ANOVA, and discriminant function analysis (DFA) identified the significant multivariate predictors of FR status. RESULTS: After controlling for disability level, the IFR group had significantly (p<0.05) worse scores on measures of mobility (i.e., MSWS-12, 6MW, and steps/day) compared to the NFR group.

Yet there is no method to objectively measure tremor and effectiveness of interventions on tremor. This study aimed to test validity and reliability of a new objective measurement for upper limb tremor in people with multiple sclerosis. Method: Twelve participants with multiple sclerosis who self-reported tremor were observed performing standardised tasks. Validity and reliability of a new method to detect tremor from wrist movement was established against occupational therapist observation of tremor (FAHN). Concurrent validity of severity (displacement) of tremor was assessed. Responsiveness to change in tremor characteristics was explored in a sub-set of participants using weighted wrist-cuffs. Results: The new method correctly predicted 98.2% of tremor cases identified by the occupational therapist, with high sensitivity (0.988) and specificity (0.976). Calculated displacement of tremor correlated with FAHN tremor severity scores moderately (rs=.452, p=.004). The new measure was responsive to changes in tremor characteristics due to change in weight of wrist-cuffs.

Such assessment is usually based on patients' estimates or on the measures the neurologists observe during periodic visits. Objectives and methods We evaluated the agreement between patients' and neurologists' estimates of maximum walking ability and patients' mean maximum walking ability measured in their daily life through a GPS smartwatch, and assessed limitations of the current methods. Results Seventy-three patients with a median walking ability of 500 m (IQR 400–800) were enrolled in the study. The agreement between patients' estimates and GPS measurements was modest (ICC 0.29, 95% CIs 0.06–0.49) and was influenced by course of the disease, patients' mood and inaccuracy at estimating long distances. A better reliability was found between neurologists' and GPS measures (ICC 0.68, 95% CIs 0.53–0.78), but the variability increased for longer distances and was influenced by patients' depressive symptoms, fatigue and course of the disease. Conclusions This study showed a poor agreement between patients' and neurologists' estimates of maximum walking ability and patients' mean maximum walking ability measured in their daily life through a GPS smartwatch, with many factors affecting patient's and neurologists' estimates of the EDSS.

The results show no differences in terms of gait velocity, stride length, stance/swing and double support phases duration, while HR in the direction of motion was significantly lower in pwMS (2.92 vs. 3.67, p < 0.001), thus indicating a less smooth gait. The study of trunk accelerations through calculation of HR represents a fast, non-intrusive technique that allows early identification of anomalies in gait patterns of pwMS in absence of disability.";"Article";"10.1016/J.GAITPOST.2017.08.023";"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=18792219&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.gaitpost.2017.08.023&atitle=Smoothness+of+gait+detects+early+alterations+of+walking+in+persons+with+multiple+sclerosis+without+disability&stitle=Gait+Posture&title=Gait+and+Posture&volume=58&issue=&spage=307&epage=309&aulast=Pau&aufirst=Massimiliano&auinit=M.&aufull=Pau+M.&coden=GAPOF&isbn=&pages=307-309&date=2017&auinit1=M&auinitm=";"Embase";"Yes";"";"";"yes";"";"";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

We here aimed to explore two standard methods (subjective plus objective) to assess PA reduction in PwMS and to describe the relation of PA to health-related quality of life (hrQoL). Methods: PA was objectively measured over a 7-day period in 26 PwMS (EDSS 1.5-6.0) and 30 matched healthy controls (HC) using SenseWear mini® armband (SWAmini) and reported as step count, mean total and activity related energy expenditure (EE) as well as time spent in PA of different intensities. Measures of EE were also derived from self-assessment with IPAQ (International Physical Activity Questionnaire) long version, which additionally yielded information on the context of PA and a classification into subjects' PA levels. To explore the convergence between both types of assessment, IPAQ categories (low, moderate, high) were related to selected PA parameters from objective assessment using ANOVA. Group differences and associated effect sizes for all PA parameters as well as their relation to clinical and hrQoL measures were determined. Results: Both, SWAmini and IPAQ assessment, captured differences in PA between PwMS and HC. IPAQ categories fit well with common cut-offs for step count (p=0.002) and mean METs (p=0.004) to determine PA levels with objective devices. Correlations between specifically matched pairs of IPAQ and SWAmini parameters ranged between r.288 and r.507. Concerning hrQoL, the lower limb mobility subscore was related to four PA measures, while a relation with patients' report of general contentment was only seen for one. Conclusions: Both methods of assessment seem applicable in PwMS and able to describe reductions in daily PA at group level. Whether they can be used to track individual effects of interventions to enhance PA levels needs further exploration. The relation of PA measures with hrQoL seen with lower limb mobility suggests lower limb function not only as a major target for intervention to increase PA but also as a possible surrogate for PA changes.";"Article";"10.1186/S12883-016-0783-0";"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14712377&id=doi:10.1186%2Fs12883-016-0783-0&atitle=Subjective+and+objective+assessment+of+physical+activity+in+multiple+sclerosis+and+their+relation+to+health-related+quality+of+life&stitle=BMC+Neurol.&title=BMC+Neurology&volume=17&issue=1&spage=&epage=&aulast=Kr%C3%BCger&aufirst=Theresa&auinit=T.&aufull=Kr%C3%BCger+T.&coden=BNMEC&isbn=&pages=-&date=2017&auinit1=T&auinitm=";"Embase";"Yes";"";"";"yes";"";"";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

However, objective assessment of balance usually requires clinical expertise and/or the use of expensive and obtrusive measuring equipment. These barriers to the objective assessment of balance may be overcome with the development of a lightweight inertial sensor system. In this study, we examined the concurrent validity of a novel wireless, skin-mounted inertial sensor system (BioStamp®, MC10 Inc.) to measure postural sway in individuals with MS by comparing measurement agreement between this novel sensor and gold standard measurement tools (force plate and externally validated inertial sensor). A total of 39 individuals with MS and 15 healthy controls participated in the study. Participants with MS were divided into groups based on the amount of impairment (MS(Mild): EDSS 2-4, n = 19; MS(Severe): EDSS ≥6, n = 20). The balance assessment consisted of two 30-s quiet standing trials in each of three conditions: Eyes open/firm surface, eyes closed/firm surface, and eyes open/foam surface. For each trial, postural sway was recorded with a force plate (Bertec) and simultaneously using two accelerometers (BioStamp and Xsens) mounted on the participant's posterior trunk at L5. Sway metrics (sway area, sway path length, root mean square amplitude, mean velocity, JERK, and total power) were derived to compare the measurement agreement among the measurement devices. Excellent agreement (intraclass correlation coefficients >0.9) between sway metrics derived from the BioStamp and the MTx sensors were observed across all conditions and groups. Good to excellent correlations (r >0.7) between devices were observed in all sway metrics and conditions. Additionally, the acceleration sway metrics were nearly as effective as the force plate sway metrics in differentiating individuals with poor balance from healthy controls. Overall, the BioStamp sensor is a valid and objective measurement tool for postural sway assessment.

Methods: Balance control during stance and gait tasks of 24 remitting-phase patients (mean age 43.7 ± 10.5, 15 women, mean EDSS at baseline 2.45 ± 1.01) was examined every 3 months over 9 months and compared to that of nine relapsing patients (age 42.0 ± 12.7, all women, mean EDSS at relapse onset 3.11 ± 0.96) examined at relapse onset and 3 months later. Balance was also compared to that of 40 healthy controls (HCs) (age 39.7 ± 12.6, 25 women). Balance control was measured as lower-trunk sway angles with body-worn gyroscopes. Expanded Disability Status Scale scores (EDSS) were used to monitor, clinically, disease progression. Results: Remitting-phase patients showed more unstable stance balance control than HCs (p < 0.04) with no worsening over the observation period of 9 months. Gait balance control was normal (p > 0.06). Relapsing patients had stance balance control significantly worse at onset compared to remitting-phase patients and HCs (p < 0.04). Gait tasks showed a significant decrease of gait speed and trunk sway in relapsing patients (p = 0.018) compatible with having increased gait instability at normal speeds. Improvement to levels of remitting patients generally took longer than 3 months. Balance and EDSS scores were correlated for remitting but not for relapse patients. Conclusions: Balance in remitting RRMS patients does not change significantly over 9 months and correlated well with EDSS scores. Our results indicate that balance control is a useful measure to assess recovery after a relapse, particularly in patients with unchanged EDSS scores.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate segmental control during quiet standing in PwMS and controls to understand whether MS alters use of the ankle and hip strategies to manage postural sway. Coherence of acceleration between the trunk and legs was evaluated with accelerometers placed on the sacrum and lower leg. Thirty-six PwMS and 20 healthy control subjects performed quiet standing with eyes open and closed while center of pressure (CoP) and acceleration of postural sway was measured. Acceleration frequencies were divided into lower frequencies (?1.0 Hz) and higher frequencies (>1.0 Hz) to categorize sway characteristics. With eyes open, coherence was significantly lower in PwMS compared to controls at lower frequencies only. With eyes closed, coherence was significantly lower in PwMS compared to controls, who use an ankle strategy at lower frequencies only, at both lower and higher frequencies. Both groups showed decreased coherence with increasing frequency when eyes were open and closed. Coherence was significantly correlated with CoP sway area in PwMS during the eyes closed condition only. The reduced coherence in PwMS during both lower and higher frequency sway indicates PwMS utilize a mixed ankle-hip sway strategy regardless of sway frequency. This is in contrast to sway in healthy subjects which utilizes an ankle strategy at lower frequencies and a mixed strategy at higher frequencies.

The aim of this study was to characterise gait in both laboratory and daily life conditions for a group of patients with moderate to severe ambulatory impairment due to MS. To this purpose, algorithms to detect and characterise gait from wearable inertial sensors data were also validated. Methods Fourteen patients with MS were divided into two groups according to their disability level (EDSS 6.5–6.0 and EDSS 5.5–5.0, respectively). They performed both intermittent and continuous walking bouts (WBs) in a gait laboratory wearing waist and shank mounted inertial sensors. An algorithm (W-CWT) to estimate gait events and temporal parameters (mean and variability values) using data recorded from the waist mounted sensor (Dynaport, Mc Roberts) was tested against a reference algorithm (S-REF) based on the shank-worn sensors (OPAL, APDM). Subsequently, the accuracy of another algorithm (W-PAM) to detect and classify WBs was also tested. The validated algorithms were then used to quantify gait characteristics during short (sWB, 5–50 steps), intermediate (iWB, 51–100 steps) and long (lWB, >100 steps) daily living WBs and laboratory walking. Group means were compared using a two-way ANOVA. Results W-CWT compared to S-REF showed good gait event accuracy (0.05–0.10 s absolute error) and was not influenced by disability level. It slightly overestimated stride time in intermittent walking (0.012 s) and overestimated highly variability of temporal parameters in both intermittent (17.5%–58.2%) and continuous walking (11.2%–76.7%). The accuracy of W-PAM was speed-dependent and decreased with increasing disability. The ANOVA analysis showed that patients walked at a slower pace in daily living than in the laboratory. In daily living gait, all mean temporal parameters decreased as the WB duration increased. In the sWB, the patients with a lower disability score showed, on average, lower values of the temporal parameters. Variability decreased as the WB duration increased. Conclusions This study validated a method to quantify walking in real life in people with MS and showed how gait characteristics estimated from short walking bouts during daily living may be the most informative to quantify level of disability and effects of interventions in patients moderately affected by MS. The study provides a robust approach for the quantification of recog-nised clinically relevant outcomes and an innovative perspective in the study of real life walking.";"Article";"10.1371/JOURNAL.PONE.0196463";"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=19326203&id=doi:10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0196463&atitle=Free-living+and+laboratory+gait+characteristics+in+patients+with+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=PLoS+ONE&title=PLoS+ONE&volume=13&issue=5&spage=&epage=&aulast=Storm&aufirst=Fabio+A.&auinit=F.A.&aufull=Storm+F.A.&coden=POLNC&isbn=&pages=-&date=2018&auinit1=F&auinitm=A";"Embase";"Yes";"";"";"yes";"";"";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

The objectives of this study were to advance the literature on the utility of free-living physical activity tracking from secondary analyses of a pilot study in MS patients. Method: The original observational study was conducted in participants with MS at PatientsLikeMe (www.PatientsLikeMe.com), an online network of patients with chronic diseases. Participants completed a baseline self-assessment, and received a Fitbit One(TM) wearable device with instructions to upload data. Eligible participants (1) self-reported MS, (2) logged on to the PatientsLikeMe website 90 days prior to enrollment, and (3) consented to participate electronically. Participants (1) < 18 years, (2) living outside the United States, and (3) requiring wheelchair assistance for most daily activities were excluded. The secondary analyses were limited to participants with complete data on MS type, disease duration, and Multiple Sclerosis Rating Scale (MSRS) and at least 7 days of wearable data. Step count was used as a measure of physical activity. Results: The analysis cohort of 114 participants uploaded a mean of 20.1 days of wearable data over the 23-day study (87% adherence); participants averaged 4,393 steps per day. The mean age of participants was 52 years, predominantly female (75%), relapsing-remitting type (79%), with mean disease duration of 16 years. Mean MSRS score within 30-day of baseline was 32; 72% reported mild-moderate walking disability. The reliability of step count measured by intraclass correlation was 0.55 for a single day, ≥0.7 for 2-day average, and ≥0.9 for 7-day average. After controlling for covariates, self-reported disease severity (MSRS quartile) was an independent predictor of step count (p < 0.001). Least square means (LS means) for participants that were least disabled (lowest quartile) was 5,937 steps, which was significantly higher than participants in the second, third, and fourth quartiles (4,570, 3,490, and 3,272, respectively). Similarly, LS means of participants with no ambulatory disability (measured by MSRS walk component) was 6,931 steps, significantly higher than participants with greater disability (4,743, 4,394, 2,727 steps for symptomatic, mild, and moderate disability, respectively, p < 0.001). Discussion: Using an interactive platform, this study captured free-living mobility data in MS patients. Important metrics such as the use of a minimum of 2-day estimates and self-reported disability were found to be robust indicators and correlates, respectively, of participant activity levels. Further triangulation of such metrics may reduce the burden on patients, clinicians, and researchers when monitoring clinical status.";"Article";"10.1159/000488040";"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=2504110X&id=doi:10.1159%2F000488040&atitle=Free-living+physical+activity+monitoring+in+Adult+US+Patients+with+multiple+sclerosis+using+a+consumer+wearable+device&stitle=Digit.+Biomarkers&title=Digital+Biomarkers&volume=2&issue=1&spage=47&epage=63&aulast=Dasmahapatra&aufirst=Pronabesh&auinit=P.&aufull=Dasmahapatra+P.&coden=&isbn=&pages=47-63&date=2018&auinit1=P&auinitm=";"Embase";"Yes";"";"Fitbit";"yes";"";"";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

METHODS: A total of eight functional tests were conducted and physical activity was objectively measured (Actigraph GT3X accelerometer) for one week in 34 people with multiple sclerosis. A corrected Akaike Information Criterion analysis was performed to identify the strongest correlates with moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, total activity and sedentary time. RESULTS: The multiple regression analysis converged on a model for moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (R2?=?0.31, F?=?6.97, p=?0.003) that included total strength of the less-affected leg (partial r?=?0.46, p?=?0.007) and average peg test performance (partial r?=?-0.30, p?=?0.087). The model for total activity (R2?=?0.40, F?=?10.51, p?<?0.001) included five times sit-to-stand performance (partial r=?-0.44, p?=?0.010) and total strength of the less-affected leg (partial r?=?0.31, p?=?0.077). The model for sedentary time (R2=0.22, F?=?9.23, p?=?0.005) only included total strength of the more affected leg (r=?-0.47, p?=?0.005). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that leg strength, manual dexterity and the ability to perform functional tasks may be important correlates with physical activity levels in people with multiple sclerosis. The findings of this pilot study can inform future investigations aiming to increase physical activity levels or develop improved rehabilitation protocols for people with multiple sclerosis. Implications for Rehabilitation Physical activity is an effective means of improving the symptoms associated with multiple sclerosis. Participation in physical activity by people with multiple sclerosis may be affected by functional factors such as leg strength, manual dexterity and the ability to rise from a seated position. Bilateral leg strength differences should be assessed and addressed in people with multiple sclerosis.";"Article";"10.1080/09638288.2017.1336647";"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14645165&id=doi:10.1080%2F09638288.2017.1336647&atitle=Functional+factors+that+are+important+correlates+to+physical+activity+in+people+with+multiple+sclerosis%3A+a+pilot+study&stitle=Disabil+Rehabil&title=Disability+and+rehabilitation&volume=40&issue=20&spage=2416&epage=2423&aulast=Ketelhut&aufirst=Nathaniel+B.&auinit=N.B.&aufull=Ketelhut+N.B.&coden=&isbn=&pages=2416-2423&date=2018&auinit1=N&auinitm=B";"Embase";"Yes";"";"";"no";"Out of scope";"";"Included";"";"included";"accelerometer used as outcome measure";NA

These estimations require knowledge of 3D forces and moments (F&#x0026;M), and accurate foot positions. Though an existing Ambulatory Gait and Balance System (AGBS) consisting of 3D F&#x0026;M sensors, and inertial measurement units (IMUs) can be used for the purpose, it is bulky and conspicuous. Resistive pressure sensors were investigated as an alternative to the onboard 3D F&#x0026;M sensors. Subject specific regression models were built to estimate 3D F&#x0026;M from 1D plantar pressures. The model was applicable for different walking speeds. Different pressure sensor configurations were studied to optimise system complexity and accuracy. Using resistive sensors only under the toe and heel, we were able to estimate the XCoM with a mean absolute RMS error of 2.2&#x00B1;0.3 cm in the walking direction while walking at a preferred speed, when compared to the AGBS. For the same case, the XCoM was classified as ahead or behind the Base of Support correctly at 97.7 &#x00B1; 1.7%.

We hypothesized that aggregating data from two simple smartphone tests of fine finger movements with differing contribution of specific neurological domains (i.e., strength & cerebellar functions, vision, and reaction time) will allow establishment of secondary outcomes that reflect domain-specific deficit. This hypothesis was tested by assessing correlations of smartphone-derived outcomes with relevant parts of neurological examination in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. We developed MS test suite on Android platform, consisting of several simple functional tests. This paper compares cross-sectional and longitudinal performance of Finger tapping and Balloon popping tests by 76 MS patients and 19 healthy volunteers (HV). The primary outcomes of smartphone tests, the average number of taps (per two 10-s intervals) and the average number of pops (per two 26-s intervals) differentiated MS from HV with similar power to traditional, investigator-administered test of fine finger movements, 9-hole peg test (9HPT). Additionally, the secondary outcomes identified patients with predominant cerebellar dysfunction, motor fatigue and poor eye-hand coordination and/or reaction time, as evidenced by significant correlations between these derived outcomes and relevant parts of neurological examination. The intra-individual variance in longitudinal sampling was low. In the time necessary for performing 9HPT, smartphone tests provide much richer and reliable measurements of several distinct neurological functions.

This task is usually assessed with clinical scales suffering from partial subjectivity and limited detail in evaluating different task aspects. In this paper, we instrumented the assessment of stair ascent in people with multiple sclerosis (MS), stroke (ST), and Parkinson's disease (PD) to analyze the validity of the proposed quantitative indexes and characterize subjects' performances. Participants climbed 10 steps wearing a magneto-inertial sensor [magneto-inertial measurement unit (MIMU)] at sternum level. Gait pattern features (step frequency, symmetry, regularity, and harmonic ratios), and upper trunk sway were computed from MIMU signals. Clinical modified dynamic gait index (mDGI) and mDGI-Item 8 'Up stairs' were administered. Significant correlations with clinical scores were found for gait pattern features (rs≥ 0.536) and trunk pitch sway (rs≤-0.367) demonstrating their validity. Instrumental indexes showed alterations in the three pathological groups compared to healthy subjects and significant differences, not clinically detected, among MS, ST, and PD. MS showed the worst performance, with alterations of all gait pattern aspects and larger trunk pitch sway. ST showed worsening in gait pattern features but not in trunk motion. PD showed fewer alterations consisting in reduced step frequency and trunk yaw sway. These results suggest that the use of an MIMU provided valid objective indexes revealing between-group differences in stair ascent not detected by clinical scales. Importantly, the indexes include upper trunk measures, usually not present in clinical tests, and provide relevant hints for tailored rehabilitation.";"Article";"10.1109/TNSRE.2018.2881324";"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=15344320&id=doi:10.1109%2FTNSRE.2018.2881324&atitle=Instrumental+Assessment+of+Stair+Ascent+in+People+with+Multiple+Sclerosis%2C+Stroke%2C+and+Parkinson%27s+Disease%3A+A+Wearable-Sensor-Based+Approach&stitle=IEEE+Trans.+Neural+Syst.+Rehabil.+Eng.&title=IEEE+Transactions+on+Neural+Systems+and+Rehabilitation+Engineering&volume=26&issue=12&spage=2324&epage=2332&aulast=Carpinella&aufirst=Ilaria&auinit=I.&aufull=Carpinella+I.&coden=ITNSB&isbn=&pages=2324-2332&date=2018&auinit1=I&auinitm=";"Embase";"Yes";"";"";"yes";"";"Conference paper with sufficient data";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Outcome measures included the Symbol Digit Modalities Test to assess cognition. Texting measures included accuracy (%) and duration(s). Gait was assessed with axial accelerometers to quantify temporal measures. The dual-task cost percentage for the walking tests and texting accuracy was determined by calculating the percentage change from a single task to a double task. The impact of texting while walking on gait measures was significantly higher in PwMS; furthermore, texting was less accurate compared to the healthy controls. The dual-task cost for texting accuracy in the PwMS group was 153.3 (SD = 105.7) compared to 8.9 (SD = 26.6) in the healthy group.

Objective To develop specific measures of MS-associated walking capacity through statistically sophisticated HPA analysis, thereby more precisely defining the real-world impact of disease. Methods Eighty-eight MS and 38 control subjects completed timed walks and patient-reported outcomes in clinic, then wore an accelerometer for 7 days. HPA was analyzed with several new statistics, including the maximum step rate (MSR) and habitual walking step rate (HWSR), along with conventional methods, including average daily steps. HPA statistics were validated using clinical walking outcomes. Results The six-minute walk (6MW) step rate correlated most strongly with MSR (r = 0.863, p < 10(−25)) and HWSR (r = 0.815, p < 10(−11)) rather than average daily steps (r = 0.676, p < 10(−11)). The combination of MSR and HWSR correlated more strongly with the 6 MW step rate than either measure alone (r = 0.884, p < 10(−14)). The MSR overestimated the 6 MW step rate (μ = 10.4, p < 10(−7)), whereas the HWSR underestimated it (μ = −18.2, p < 10(−19)).

Objectives: To develop an accurate method for remote assessment of walking speed and to test how predictive the clinic T25FW is for real-life walking. Methods: An AX3-Axivity tri-axial accelerometer was positioned on 32 MS patients (Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS] 0-6) in the clinic, who subsequently wore it at home for up to 7 days. Gait speed was calculated from these data using both a model developed with healthy volunteers and individually personalized models generated from a machine learning algorithm. Results: The healthy volunteer model predicted gait speed poorly for more disabled people with MS. However, the accuracy of individually personalized models was high regardless of disability (R-value = 0.98, p-value = 1.85 × 10(-22)). With the latter, we confirmed that the clinic T25FW is strongly predictive of the maximum sustained gait speed in the home environment (R-value = 0.89, p-value = 4.34 × 10(-8)).

However, no specific investigations have been performed on people with Multiple Sclerosis (pwMS), who are already characterized by gait dysfunctions caused by the disease. Objective To assess the existence of possible alterations in spatio-temporal parameters of gait in pwMS when simultaneously texting on a smartphone and walking. Methods Fifty-four pwMS (mean age 40.5 ± 10.5) and 40 age-matched unaffected individuals were tested in two conditions: walking, and walking while texting on a smartphone. Spatio-temporal parameters of gait were assessed using a wearable accelerometer located on the lower back. Results Texting induces reduction of gait speed, stride length and cadence in both groups, but such changes were smaller in magnitude in pwMS. An increase of stance and double support and reduction of swing phase were observed in pwMS only. Conclusions Texting alters gait patterns of pwMS differently from unaffected individuals, probably due to a different prioritization of the task, which appears to take into account the motor and sensory impairments associated with the disease by favoring the motor task.";"Article";"10.1016/J.MSARD.2017.11.021";"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=22110356&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.msard.2017.11.021&atitle=Texting+while+walking+differently+alters+gait+patterns+in+people+with+multiple+sclerosis+and+healthy+individuals&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+Relat.+Disord.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+and+Related+Disorders&volume=19&issue=&spage=129&epage=133&aulast=Pau&aufirst=Massimiliano&auinit=M.&aufull=Pau+M.&coden=&isbn=&pages=129-133&date=2018&auinit1=M&auinitm=";"Embase";"Yes";"";"";"yes";"";"";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

The Timed-Up-And-Go (TUG) task is used to assess patient mobility because it incorporates clinically-relevant submovements during standing. Most sensor-based TUG research has focused on the placement of sensors at the spine, hip or ankles; an examination of thigh activity in TUG in multiple sclerosis is wanting. Methods: We used validated sensors (x-IMU by x-io) to derive transparent metrics for the sit-to-stand (SI-ST) transition and the stand-to-sit (ST-SI) transition of TUG, and compared effect sizes for metrics from inertial sensors on the thighs to effect sizes for metrics from a sensor placed at the L3 level of the lumbar spine. Twenty-three healthy volunteers were compared to 17 ambulatory persons with MS (PwMS, HAI = 2). Results: During the SI-ST transition, the metric with the largest effect size comparing healthy volunteers to PwMS was the Area Under the Curve of the thigh angular velocity in the pitch direction-representing both thigh and knee extension; the peak of the spine pitch angular velocity during SI-ST also had a large effect size, as did some temporal measures of duration of SI-ST, although less so. During the ST-SI transition the metric with the largest effect size in PwMS was the peak of the spine angular velocity curve in the roll direction. A regression was performed. Discussion: We propose for PwMS that the diminished peak angular velocity during SI-ST directly represents extensor weakness, while the increased roll during ST-SI represents diminished postural control. Conclusions: During the SI-ST transition of TUG, angular velocities can discriminate between healthy volunteers and ambulatory PwMS better than temporal features. Sensor placement on the thighs provides additional discrimination compared to sensor placement at the lumbar spine.";"Article";"10.3389/FNEUR.2018.00684";"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=16642295&id=doi:10.3389%2Ffneur.2018.00684&atitle=Thigh-derived+inertial+sensor+metrics+to+assess+the+sit-to-stand+and+stand-to-sit+transitions+in+the+timed+up+and+go+%28TUG%29+Task+for+quantifying+mobility+impairment+in+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Front.+Neurol.&title=Frontiers+in+Neurology&volume=9&issue=SEP&spage=&epage=&aulast=Witchel&aufirst=Harry+J.&auinit=H.J.&aufull=Witchel+H.J.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2018&auinit1=H&auinitm=J";"Embase";"Yes";"";"";"yes";"";"";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

The HCS yields categories of insufficiently active (less substantial or low benefits), moderately active (some benefits), and active (substantial benefits). The present study examined the validity of the GLTEQ HCS and its categories as reflecting levels of MVPA in multiple sclerosis (MS). Method: The sample included 684 persons with MS. Participants wore an accelerometer on an elastic belt around the waist above the nondominant hip during the waking hours of the day over a 7-day period and completed the GLTEQ. Results: The data analyses supported a large correlation between the GLTEQ HCS and accelerometer-measured MVPA, r = .46, p ≤ .0001, but small correlations with accelerometer-measured light physical activity (LPA), r = .16, p ≤ .001 and sedentary time, r =-.13, p = .001. There further was a large difference in accelerometer-measured MVPA between categories of physical activity levels (i.e., insufficiently active vs. active) based on the GLTEQ HCS (d = 0.89), but small differences in LPA (d = 0.39) and sedentary time (d=-0.31). Those results were unchanged in additional data analyses accounting for LPA and sedentary behavior. Conclusions: The GLTEQ HCS and categories primarily reflect MVPA rather than LPA and sedentary behavior in persons with MS.";"Article";"10.1037/REP0000162";"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=19391544&id=doi:10.1037%2Frep0000162&atitle=Validation+of+the+godin+leisure-time+exercise+questionnaire+classification+coding+system+using+accelerometry+in+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Rehabil.+Psychol.&title=Rehabilitation+Psychology&volume=63&issue=1&spage=77&epage=82&aulast=Motl&aufirst=Robert+W.&auinit=R.W.&aufull=Motl+R.W.&coden=RHBPB&isbn=&pages=77-82&date=2018&auinit1=R&auinitm=W";"Embase";"Yes";"";"";"yes";"";"";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Ankle joint contractures in PwMS are common and often result in compensatory gait patterns to accommodate reduced ankle range of motion (ROM). APPROACH: Using advances in wearable technology, the aim of this study was to quantify head and pelvis movement patterns that occur in PwMS with disability and determine how these secondary gait compensations impact on gait stability. Twelve healthy participants and 12 PwMS participated in the study. Head and pelvis movements were measured using two tri-axial accelerometers. Measures of gait compensation, mobility, variability, asymmetry, stability and fatigue were assessed during a 6 min walking test. MAIN RESULTS: Compared to healthy controls, PwMS had greater vertical asymmetry in their head and pelvic movements (Cohen's d  =  1.85 and 1.60). Lower harmonic ratios indicated that PwMS were more unstable than controls (Cohen's d  =  -1.61 to  -3.06), even after adjusting for their slower walking speeds. In the PwMS, increased compensatory movements were correlated with reduced ankle active ROM (r  =  -0.71), higher disability (EDSS) scores (r  =  0.58), unstable gait (r  =  -0.76), reduced mobility (r  =  -0.76) and increased variability (r  =  0.83). SIGNIFICANCE: Wearable device technology provides an efficient and reliable way to screen for excessive compensatory movements often present in PwMS and provides clinically important information that impacts on mobility, stride time variability and gait stability. This information may help clinicians identify PwMS at high risk of falling and develop better rehabilitation interventions that, in addition to improving mobility, may help target the underlying causes of unstable gait.";"Article";"10.1088/1361-6579/AAC0A3";"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13616579&id=doi:10.1088%2F1361-6579%2Faac0a3&atitle=Wearable+technology+reveals+gait+compensations%2C+unstable+walking+patterns+and+fatigue+in+people+with+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Physiol+Meas&title=Physiological+measurement&volume=39&issue=7&spage=075004&epage=&aulast=Psarakis&aufirst=Michael&auinit=M.&aufull=Psarakis+M.&coden=&isbn=&pages=075004-&date=2018&auinit1=M&auinitm=";"Embase";"Yes";"";"";"yes";"";"";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Currently, assessment of these patients is mainly subjective. New assessment options using wearables may provide complementary and more objective information. Methods: In this prospective cross-sectional feasibility study performed over a four-month period, all patients referred to a normal neurology ward of a university hospital and aged between 40 and 89years were asked to participate. Gait and balance deficits were assessed with wearables at the ankles and the lower back. Frailty, sarcopenia, Parkinsonism, depression, quality of life, fall history, fear of falling, physical activity, and cognition were evaluated with questionnaires and surveys. Results: Eighty-two percent (n=384) of all eligible patients participated. Of those, 39% (n=151) had no gait and balance deficit, 21% (n=79) had gait deficits, 11% (n=44) had balance deficits and 29% (n=110) had gait and balance deficits. Parkinson's disease, stroke, epilepsy, pain syndromes, and multiple sclerosis were the most common diseases. The assessment was well accepted. Conclusions: Our study suggests that the use of wearables for the assessment of gait and balance features in a clinical setting is feasible. Moreover, preliminary results confirm previous epidemiological data about gait and balance deficits among neurological inpatients.

OBJECTIVE: The goal of the research was to assess the feasibility of remote active testing and passive monitoring using smartphones and smartwatch technology in people with multiple sclerosis with respect to adherence and satisfaction with the FLOODLIGHT test battery. METHODS: People with multiple sclerosis (aged 20 to 57 years; Expanded Disability Status Scale 0-5.5; n=76) and healthy controls (n=25) performed the FLOODLIGHT test battery, comprising active tests (daily, weekly, every two weeks, or on demand) and passive monitoring (sensor-based gait and mobility) for 24 weeks using a smartphone and smartwatch. The primary analysis assessed adherence (proportion of weeks with at least 3 days of completed testing and 4 hours per day passive monitoring) and questionnaire-based satisfaction. In-clinic assessments (clinical and magnetic resonance imaging) were performed. RESULTS: People with multiple sclerosis showed 70% (16.68/24 weeks) adherence to active tests and 79% (18.89/24 weeks) to passive monitoring; satisfaction score was on average 73.7 out of 100. Neither adherence nor satisfaction was associated with specific population characteristics. Test-battery assessments had an at least acceptable impact on daily activities in over 80% (61/72) of people with multiple sclerosis. CONCLUSIONS: People with multiple sclerosis were engaged and satisfied with the FLOODLIGHT test battery. FLOODLIGHT sensor-based measures may enable continuous assessment of multiple sclerosis disease in clinical trials and real-world settings.

More sensitive and ecologically valid outcome measures are needed to advance MS research. Objectives: To assess continuous step count activity remotely among individuals with MS for 1 year and determine how average daily step count is associated with other measures of MS disability. Design, Setting, and Participants: In a prospective longitudinal observational cohort study, 95 adults with relapsing or progressive MS who were able to walk more than 2 minutes with or without an assistive device were recruited between June 15, 2015, and August 8, 2016, and remotely monitored in their natural environment for 1 year. Patients were excluded if they had a clinical relapse within 30 days or comorbidity contributing to ambulatory impairment. Longitudinal analysis was performed from October 2017 to March 2018. Revised analysis was performed in December 2018. Intervention: Activity monitoring of step count using a wrist-worn accelerometer. Main Outcomes and Measures: Average daily step count compared with in-clinic assessments and patient-reported outcomes. Results: Of the 95 participants recruited (59 women and 36 men; mean [SD] age, 49.6 [13.6] years [range, 22.0-74.0 years]), 35 (37%) had progressive MS, and the median baseline Expanded Disability Status Scale score was 4.0 (range, 0-6.5). At 1 year, 79 participants completed follow-up (83% retention). There was a modest reduction in accelerometer use during the 1 year of the study. A decreasing average daily step count during the study was associated with worsening of clinic-based outcomes (Timed 25-Foot Walk, ??=?-13.09; P?<?.001; Timed-Up-and-Go, ??=?-9.25; P?<?.001) and patient-reported outcomes (12-item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale, ??=?-17.96; P?<?.001). A decreasing average daily step count occurred even when the Expanded Disability Status Scale score remained stable, and 12 of 25 participants (48%) with a significant decrease in average daily step count during the study did not have a reduction on other standard clinic-based metrics. Participants with a baseline average daily step count below 4766 (cohort median) had higher odds of clinically meaningful disability (Expanded Disability Status Scale score) worsening at 1 year, adjusting for age, sex, and disease duration (odds ratio, 4.01; 95% CI, 1.17-13.78; P?=?.03). Conclusions and Relevance: Continuous remote activity monitoring of individuals with MS for 1 year appears to be feasible. In this study, a decreasing average daily step count during a 1-year period was associated with worsening of standard ambulatory measures but could also occur even when traditional disability measures remained stable. These results appear to support the prospect of using the average daily step count as a sensitive longitudinal outcome measure in MS and as a clinically relevant metric for targeted intervention.";"Article";"10.1001/JAMANETWORKOPEN.2019.0570";"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=25743805&id=doi:10.1001%2Fjamanetworkopen.2019.0570&atitle=Association+of+Continuous+Assessment+of+Step+Count+by+Remote+Monitoring+With+Disability+Progression+Among+Adults+With+Multiple+Sclerosis&stitle=JAMA+Netw+Open&title=JAMA+network+open&volume=2&issue=3&spage=e190570&epage=&aulast=Block&aufirst=Valerie+J.&auinit=V.J.&aufull=Block+V.J.&coden=&isbn=&pages=e190570-&date=2019&auinit1=V&auinitm=J";"Embase";"Yes";"";"";"no";"Out of scope";"";"Included";"";"included";"";NA

Methods: Ambulatory adults with MS (N = 107) completed 7 days of home monitoring. Continuous physical activity data (assessed via wrist-worn accelerometer) and concurrent ecological momentary assessment (5X/day) of pain, fatigue, depressed mood, and perceived cognitive function were collected. Data were analyzed using multilevel mixed modeling. Results: Fatigue and depressed mood demonstrated bidirectional associations with physical activity, whereas pain and cognitive function did not. Higher than usual fatigue (B = -5.83, p = .001) and depressed mood (B = -4.12, p = .03) were followed by decreased physical activity. In contrast, higher than usual physical activity was associated with subsequent decline in fatigue (B = -0.001, p = .02) and depressed mood (B = -0.0007, p = .02); however, the association between physical activity and fatigue varied across the day.

We aimed to determine which gait features become worse during sustained walking and to examine the clinical correlates of gait fatigability in pwMS. Fifty-eight pwMS performed the 6-min walk test while wearing body-fixed sensors. Multiple gait domains (e.g., pace, rhythm, variability, asymmetry and complexity) were compared across each minute of the test and between mild- and moderate-disability patient groups. Associations between the decline in gait performance (i.e., gait fatigability) and patient-reported gait disability, fatigue and falls were also determined. Cadence, stride time variability, stride regularity, step regularity and gait complexity significantly deteriorated during the test. In contrast, somewhat surprisingly, gait speed and swing time asymmetry did not change. As expected, subjects with moderate disability (n = 24) walked more poorly in most gait domains compared to the mild-disability group (n = 34). Interestingly, a group × fatigue interaction effect was observed for cadence and gait complexity; these measures decreased over time in the moderate-disability group, but not in the mild group. Gait fatigability rate was significantly correlated with physical fatigue, gait disability, and fall history. These findings suggest that sustained walking affects specific aspects of gait, which can be used as markers for fatigability in MS. This effect on gait depends on the degree of disability, and may increase fall risk in pwMS.

Purpose: This study involved a secondary analysis of data focused on SCT constructs as correlates of individual-level changes (i.e., response heterogeneity)following a behavioral intervention. Method: Twenty-two persons with MS who completed a 6-month SCT-based behavioral intervention for increasing physical activity were included in analyses. The intervention consisted of two primary components, namely a dedicated Internet website and one-on-one video chats with a behavioral coach. Outcomes included objectively-measured moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA)using Actigraph model GT3X+ accelerometers and self-reported physical activity using the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ)as well as SCT variables of exercise self-efficacy, barriers self-efficacy, outcome expectations, goal setting and planning and facilitators/impediments. Results: There was individual variability in physical activity change following the intervention. For example, 4/22 participants demonstrated a reduction in MVPA, 1/22 participants had no change, 9/22 participants had less than 0.5 standard deviation (SD)increase in MVPA, and 8/22 participants had an increase in MVPA of more than 0.5 SD. Baseline SCT variables, particularly outcome expectations, goal setting, planning, and barriers self-efficacy, correlated with increased physical activity.

However, their ecological validity has recently been questioned. The aim of the present study was to investigate the ecological validity of the 2- and 6-minutes walking tests (2MWT and 6MWT) and the timed 25-foot walk (T25FW) after 28 days of multidisciplinary inpatient rehabilitation (MIR) in pwMS using accelerometry. Methods PwMS wore an accelerometer on 7 consecutive days within a 14-day period prior to MIR, performed 2/6MWT and T25FW at the beginning and at the end of MIR, followed by another 7 consecutive days of accelerometry. Results Significant improvements in 2/6MWT and T25FW after MIR in a cohort of 76 pwMS (mean age = 47.9, SD 8.3 years) were overall correlated to a significant gain in everyday life mobility (total steps/day). However, the correlation was strongly dependent on pre-existing walking disability defined by EDSS and only pwMS with “mild” walking impairment (EDSS 2–3.5) were able to transfer benefits measurable by walking capacity tests into improved everyday life mobility, while pwMS with “moderate to severe” walking disability (EDSS 4–6.5) were not.

Methods This two-phase study recruited online research network members reporting MS and who were utilizing Fitbit One (TM) activity trackers. In the first phase, participant interviews assessed demand based on physical activity and the use of behavior-change techniques. The second phase assessed the demand, limited efficacy, acceptability, and practicality of a Wearables 101 course that integrated behavior change and self-experimentation principles. Tracker data were used to determine the percent of matches between daily symptom-based step goals and step counts. Results Participants expressed demand in the form of interest in gaining insights about a possible sweet spot behavioral target, if a system could be produced to support that. Limited efficacy results were mixed, with approximately one-third of participants dropping out and only half matching their daily target goals for at least 50% of days. In terms of practicality, participants commented on the burden of daily measurement and the need for a longer baseline period. Participants noted that tracking helped support an understanding of the link between activities and symptom severity, suggesting acceptability. Conclusions Results suggested that the intervention demand and acceptability criteria were demonstrated more strongly than limited efficacy and practicality. The matching intervention tested in this study will require refinement in baseline measurement, goal definition, and reduced data-gathering burden. Such changes may improve efficacy and practicality requirements and, by extension, later impact of the intervention on MS outcomes. Overall, these results provide justification for additional work on refining the intervention to increase practicality and efficacy.";"Article";"10.1177/2055207619872077";"WOS:000483763900001";"WoS";"Yes";"";"Fitbit";"no";"Out of scope";"Read for discussion";"Included";"";"Out of scope (outcomes)";"Fitbit";"in"

However, instrumental assessment is needed to provide quantitative measures. Objective: To develop and validate an instrumented version of the mDGI. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Clinical setting. Participants: Thirty adults with neurologic disorders (10 with multiple sclerosis, 10 with Parkinson disease, and 10 with stroke) and 20 healthy volunteers. Methods: Participants were assessed with the Timed Up and Go test (TUG) and with the mDGI. During the assessment of mDGI, data were collected by a single Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) positioned on the sternum. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the instrumented data extracting eight PC scores (ImPC) describing dynamic balance. The instrumented overall score (ImDGI) was then calculated as the sum of the mPCs. PCA revealed two components associated with stride features and regularity (ImDGI_Gait_Pattern) and trunk movements (ImDGI_Trunk_Sway). Spearman coefficients were calculated between mDGI and ImDGI, whereas Mann-Whitney (U) and Kruskal-Wallis (H) tests assessed differences between groups and neurologic conditions. Main Outcome Measurements: ImDGI. Results: ImDGI did not show ceiling effects, and good correlations were found between ImDGI and mDGI (r =.84), and TUG (r =.84) for people with neurologic disorders (P <.001). Significant differences among pathologies (H test((2))=12.5, P =.002) and between healthy participants and adults with neurologic disorders (U test = 47.0, P =.001) were found. ImDGI_Trunk_Sway discriminated between people using or not using walking aids and among the three pathologies (H((2)) = 10.0, P =.007).

Nonetheless, it is not clear how IMU-based metrics might be influenced by pragmatic aspects associated with clinical translation of this approach, such as data collection settings and gait protocols. In this study, we hypothesised that these aspects do not significantly alter those characteristics of gait that are more related to quality and energetic efficiency and are quantifiable via acceleration related metrics, such as intensity, smoothness, stability, symmetry, and regularity. To test this hypothesis, we compared 33 IMU-based metrics extracted from data, retrospectively collected by two independent centres on two matched cohorts of pwMS. As a worst-case scenario, a walking test was performed in the two centres at a different speed along corridors of different lengths, using different IMU systems, which were also positioned differently. The results showed that the majority of the temporal metrics (9 out of 12) exhibited significant between-centre differences. Conversely, the between-centre differences in the gait quality metrics were small and comparable to those associated with a test-retest analysis under equivalent conditions.

To date, this relationship has been predominantly examined in young and middle-aged adults rather than in the rapidly-growing population of older adults with MS who often times have greater walking problems and are less physically active. This study examined whether physical activity was differentially associated with walking performance across three age groups of young (20–39 years), middle-aged (40–59 years), and older (60–79 years) adults with MS. Methods: The sample included 124 persons with MS who attended one testing session and provided demographic information, completed the Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW) and the Six Minute Walk (6MW) as measures of walking speed and walking endurance, respectively, and wore an accelerometer for a 7-day period. Results: Trend analysis indicated light physical activity did not significantly differ with increasing age; however, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), walking speed, and walking endurance declined with increasing age. Partial spearman's rank-order correlations between physical activity and walking outcomes that controlled for disease duration, race, and ambulatory disability within each age group indicated that the relationship between MVPA and walking performance was strong among older adults with MS (pr(s) for MVPA and T25FW: young = –0.01, middle-aged = –0.16, older = –0.63*; pr(s) for MVPA and 6MW: young = 0.10, middle-aged = 0.08, older = 0.68*).

Methods: 91 patients with multiple sclerosis were enrolled. Assessments included physical activity by 7-day thigh-worn accelerometry, knee extensor neuromuscular function by dynamometry (maximal isometric muscle strength, rate of force development (0-50 ms)), and physical function by 5× sit-to-stand, 2-min walk test, and timed 25 ft walk test. Physical activity tertile comparisons along with simple and multiple regressions (adjusting for age, gender, EDSS, time since diagnosis) were performed. Results: Physical activity tertiles revealed differences (p < 0.05) in maximal muscle strength (1.77 ≈ 1.97 < 2.28 Nm/kg), rate of force development (4.66 < 8.03 ≈ 10.55 Nm/kg/s), 5× sit-to-stand (11.4 ≈ 9.7 > 8.5 s), 2-min walk test (153 < 183 < 207 m), and timed 25 ft walk test (6.3 > 4.4 > 4.3 s). Moreover, physical activity was associated (p < 0.05) with maximal muscle strength and rate of force development (r2  =  0.13-0.15) along with 5× sit-to-stand, 2-min walk test, and timed 25 ft walk test (r2 = 0.18-0.24), also after adjusting for age + gender + EDSS + time since diagnosis (r2 = 0.25-0.37 and 0.24-0.52), with physical activity consistently being a strong predictor. Conclusions: Higher levels of physical activity are associated with greater neuromuscular and physical function in ambulatory patients with multiple sclerosis independent of disease severity. These findings emphasize the importance of performing regular physical activity at all stages of multiple sclerosis. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION Physical activity is associated with neuromuscular and physical function, independent of disease severity. Physical activity may be important in improving or preserving neuromuscular and physical function at all stages of ambulatory multiple sclerosis patients, yet longitudinal studies are warranted.

However, the extent to which impairments in physical and cognitive functions are manifestations of MS and disease progression, reflective of the general aging process, or perhaps 2 detrimental processes exacerbating the synergistic effects of the other is relatively unknown. This study compared physical and cognitive functions, sedentary behavior, and physical activity between 40 older adults with MS (ie, 60 years of age and older) and 40 age- and sex-matched healthy older adults. We further examined whether physical activity and/or sedentary behavior explained differences between groups in physical and cognitive functions. METHODS: Participants initially underwent the cognitive assessments, followed by the physical function assessments. The order of tests was standardized and participants were provided seated-rest between the administrations of the physical function assessments. Participants were then instructed to wear an accelerometer and document wear time in a log book for a 7-day period after the testing session. RESULTS: Multivariate analyses of variance indicated that older adults with MS (n = 40) performed worse on all measures of physical function, and 1 measure of cognitive function (ie, information-processing speed), compared with healthy controls (n = 40). Older adults with MS engaged in less moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, more sedentary behavior, and longer duration of long sedentary bouts than healthy controls. Pearson correlations demonstrated that levels and patterns of physical activity were significantly associated with a majority of physical function variables but not cognitive function variables in both older adults with MS and healthy controls but to a greater extent in older adults with MS. Partial Pearson correlations further demonstrated that levels and patterns of sedentary behavior were significantly associated with a majority of physical function variables but not cognitive function variables primarily in older adults with MS. Linear regression analyses indicated that levels and patterns of physical activity and sedentary behavior partially accounted for differences in physical and cognitive function variables between older adults with MS and healthy controls. CONCLUSION: There is evidence of reduced function in older adults with MS, and this might be partially managed by behavioral interventions that target physical activity and sedentary behavior for the promotion of healthy aging in older adults with MS.";"Article";"10.1519/JPT.0000000000000163";"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=21520895&id=doi:10.1519%2FJPT.0000000000000163&atitle=Physical+and+Cognitive+Functions%2C+Physical+Activity%2C+and+Sedentary+Behavior+in+Older+Adults+With+Multiple+Sclerosis&stitle=J+Geriatr+Phys+Ther&title=Journal+of+geriatric+physical+therapy+%282001%29&volume=42&issue=4&spage=304&epage=312&aulast=Bollaert&aufirst=Rachel+E.&auinit=R.E.&aufull=Bollaert+R.E.&coden=&isbn=&pages=304-312&date=2019&auinit1=R&auinitm=E";"Embase";"Yes";"";"";"yes";"";"";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Here, we studied multiple sclerosis (MS) as a model neurological disease for investigating physiometric and environmental signals. The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility and correlation of wearable biosensors with traditional clinical measures of disability both in clinic and in free-living in MS patients. This is a single site observational cohort study conducted at an academic neurological center specializing in MS. A cohort of 25 MS patients with varying disability scores were recruited. Patients were monitored in clinic while wearing biosensors at nine body locations at three separate visits. Biosensor-derived features including aspects of gait (stance time, turn angle, mean turn velocity) and balance were collected, along with standardized disability scores assessed by a neurologist. Participants also wore up to three sensors on the wrist, ankle, and sternum for 8 weeks as they went about their daily lives. The primary outcomes were feasibility, adherence, as well as correlation of biosensor-derived metrics with traditional neurologist-assessed clinical measures of disability. We used machine-learning algorithms to extract multiple features of motion and dexterity and correlated these measures with more traditional measures of neurological disability, including the expanded disability status scale (EDSS) and the MS functional composite-4 (MSFC-4). In free-living, sleep measures were additionally collected. Twenty-three subjects completed the first two of three in-clinic study visits and the 8-week free-living biosensor period. Several biosensor-derived features significantly correlated with EDSS and MSFC-4 scores derived at visit two, including mobility stance time with MSFC-4 z-score (Spearman correlation ?0.546; p = 0.0070), several aspects of turning including turn angle (0.437; p = 0.0372), and maximum angular velocity (0.653; p = 0.0007). Similar correlations were observed at subsequent clinic visits, and in the free-living setting. We also found other passively collected signals, including measures of sleep, that correlated with disease severity.

The interim goal is to develop simple smartphone tests (apps) and evaluate the clinical utility of these tests by selecting optimal outcomes that correlate well with clinician-measured disability in different neurological domains. In this paper, we used prospectively-acquired data from 112 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and 15 healthy volunteers (HV) to assess the performance and optimize outcomes of a Level Test. The goal of the test is to tilt the smartphone so that a free-rolling ball travels to and remains in the center of the screen. An accelerometer detects tilting and records the coordinates of the ball at set time intervals. From this data, we derived five features: path length traveled, time spent in the center of the screen, average distance from the center, average speed while in the center, and number of direction changes underwent by the ball. Time in center proved to be the most sensitive feature to differentiate MS patients from HV and had the strongest correlations with clinician-derived scales. Its superiority was validated in an independent validation cohort of 29 MS patients. A linear combination of different Level features failed to outperform time in center in an independent validation cohort. Limited longitudinal data demonstrated that the Level features were relatively stable intra-individually within 4 months, without definitive evidence of learning. In contrast to previously developed smartphone tests that predominantly measure motoric functions, Level features correlated strongly with reaction time and moderately with cerebellar functions and proprioception, validating its complementary clinical value in the MS app suite. The Level Test measures neurological disability in several domains in two independent cross-sectional cohorts (original and validation).

Objective: Hypothesis: This preliminary, cross-sectional study examined social-cognitive theory(SCT) variables as correlates of sedentary behavior in MS. We hypothesized that scores from SCT variables for sedentary behavior change would correlate with scores from self-reported and device-measured volumes of sedentary behavior in MS. We further hypothesized that the correlations would be stronger for self-reported than device-measured sedentary behavior, and that the primary correlate of sedentary behavior would be self-efficacy. Methods: We recruited participants through a random sample of 1,000 persons enrolled in the North American Research Committee on MS registry, and 275 of the 296 persons who underwent screening volunteered for the study. Participants wore an ActiGraph accelerometer on a belt around the waist for measuring minutes per day of sedentary behavior.

Each subject completed a sequence of 3 consecutive tests under 3 different task conditions: normal tandem walking, backward tandem walking and cognitive tandem walking. Tandem walking tests were evaluated via three small, lightweight axial wearable accelerometers (APDM, Oregon, USA). Results: The mean EDSS for the MS group was 1.6 (S.D = 0.6) indicating minimal disability. PwMS walked slower and at a slower pace, with a prolonged double support and decreased swing phase compared to healthy subjects in normal and backward conditions. In contrast, during the cognitive task, non-significant differences were found in gait measures between the PwMS and the healthy controls. Significant differences were found between task conditions for all participants. All reduced their walking speed and walked at a slower pace in both the cognitive and backward conditions compared to the normal tandem walk condition. However, non-significant scores were found for the condition X group factor. Significance: The study provides new insights into the 3-meter tandem walk test. Findings should improve evaluation and training of dynamic balance in fully ambulatory PwMS.";"Article";"10.1016/J.GAITPOST.2019.02.022";"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=18792219&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.gaitpost.2019.02.022&atitle=The+ability+of+the+instrumented+tandem+walking+tests+to+discriminate+fully+ambulatory+people+with+MS+from+healthy+adults&stitle=Gait+Posture&title=Gait+and+Posture&volume=70&issue=&spage=90&epage=94&aulast=Grinberg&aufirst=Yevgenia&auinit=Y.&aufull=Grinberg+Y.&coden=GAPOF&isbn=&pages=90-94&date=2019&auinit1=Y&auinitm=";"Embase";"Yes";"";"";"yes";"";"";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Changes in PB are often assumed as a consequence of fatigue, but effects of interventions that aim to reduce fatigue by improving PB are not sufficient. Since the heterogeneous nature of MS related symptoms, levels of PB of fatigued patients at the start of interventions might vary substantially. Better understanding of the variability by identification of PB subtypes in fatigued patients may help to develop more effective personalized rehabilitation programs in the future. This study aimed to identify PB subtypes in fatigued patients with multiple sclerosis based on multidimensional PB outcome measures. Methods: Baseline accelerometer (Actigraph) data, demographics and clinical characteristics of the TREFAMS-ACE participants (n = 212) were used for secondary analysis. All patients were ambulatory and diagnosed with severe fatigue based on a score of ?35 on the fatigue subscale of the Checklist Individual Strength (CIS20r). Fifteen PB measures were used derived from 7 day measurements with an accelerometer. Principal component analysis was performed to define key outcome measures for PB and two-step cluster analysis was used to identify PB types. Results: Analysis revealed five key outcome measures: percentage sedentary behavior, total time in prolonged moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, number of sedentary bouts, and two types of change scores between day parts (morning, afternoon and evening). Based on these outcomes three valid PB clusters were derived. Conclusions: Patients with severe MS-related fatigue show three distinct and homogeneous PB subtypes. These PB subtypes, based on a unique set of PB outcome measures, may offer an opportunity to design more individually-tailored interventions in rehabilitation.

Objectives: To compare the output of a newer consumer-grade accelerometer to a previous model in people with multiple sclerosis (MS) and to the ActiGraph, a waist-worn device widely used in MS research. Methods: Thirty-one individuals with MS participated in a 7-day validation by the Fitbit Flex (Flex), Fitbit Flex-2 (Flex2) and ActiGraph GT3X. Primary outcome was step count. Valid epochs of 5-min block increments, where there was overlap of ≥1 step/min for both devices were compared and summed to give a daily total for analysis. Results: Bland–Altman plots showed no systematic difference between the Flex and Flex2; mean step-count difference of 25 more steps-per-day more recorded by Flex2 (95% confidence intervals (CI) = 2, 48; p = 0.04),interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = 1.00. Compared to the ActiGraph, Flex2 (and Flex) tended to record more steps (808 steps-per-day more than the ActiGraph (95% CI= –2380, 765; p < 0.01), although the ICC was high (0.98) indicating that the devices were likely measuring the same kind of activity.

Method: Persons with MS were recruited through the distribution of printed letters to a random sample of 1,000 persons from the North American Research Committee on MS registry. Two hundred ninety-five persons with MS were interested and volunteered to wear an ActiGraph accelerometer for a 7-day period and complete a battery of questionnaires that included the IPAQ-SF and Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire over this period of time. Results: IPAQ-SF sitting time scores were consistently and moderately correlated with all of the sedentary behavior metrics from the accelerometer (range of r between .295 and .431), and the correlations were stronger than those between self-reported physical activity and sedentary metrics from the accelerometer (range of r between -.087 and .163). The correlations between IPAQ-SF sitting time scores with the accelerometer-derived sedentary behavior metrics were still statistically significant in the analyses controlling for physical activity (range of parametric correlations between .281 and .411). Conclusions: The correlation analysis indicated consistent, moderate correlations between IPAQ-SF sitting time scores and device-measured estimates of both the volume and pattern of sedentary behavior, and the correlations were (a) stronger than those for self-reported physical activity and (b) independent of self-reported physical activity.

Participants (n = 63 [15M and 48F], age: 56.6 ± 7.3 years) wore an accelerometer on the hip for a 7-day period and completed the MSQ. Sedentary behaviour (SB) estimates were computed as min/day for both the MSQ and accelerometer. Associations between the two methods were examined using the Pearson correlation and agreement was assessed using a Bland-Altman plot. A linear prediction model was developed to improve the accuracy of the MSQ estimates using a selection of predictor variables routinely collected in MS research. There was a moderate correlation between MSQ and accelerometer SB estimates (r = 0.34, p < 0.01). The Bland-Altman plot indicated that the MSQ overestimated SB (mean bias: 80.54 min/day, 95% limits of agreement: -410.5 to 571.5 min/day). The prediction model improved the MSQ estimates by 39% and virtually eliminated measurement bias (mean bias:-0.21 min/day; 95% limits of agreement:-109.8 to 109.4 min/day). The results indicate preliminary evidence for the validity of the MSQ in people with MS, and support the application of an alternative prediction model to improve the accuracy of the MSQ estimates.

MS can, for example, cause pain, changes in mood and fatigue, and may impair a person's movement, speech and visual functions. Diagnosis of MS typically involves a combination of complex clinical assessments and tests to rule out other diseases with similar symptoms. New technologies, such as smartphone monitoring in free-living conditions, could potentially aid in objectively assessing the symptoms of MS by quantifying symptom presence and intensity over long periods of time. Here, we present a deep-learning approach to diagnosing MS from smartphone-derived digital biomarkers that uses a novel combination of a multilayer perceptron with neural soft attention to improve learning of patterns in long-term smartphone monitoring data. Using data from a cohort of 774 participants, we demonstrate that our deep-learning models are able to distinguish between people with and without MS with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.70, 0.88).

These changes in gait have been well studied in laboratory and clinical settings. A thorough investigation of gait alterations during community ambulation and their contributing factors, however, is lacking. The aim of the present study was to evaluate community ambulation and physical activity in pwMS and healthy controls and to compare in-lab gait to community ambulation. To this end, 104 subjects were studied: 44 pwMS and 60 healthy controls (whose age was similar to the controls). The subjects wore a tri-axial, lower back accelerometer during usual-walking and dual-task walking in the lab and during community ambulation (1 week) to evaluate the amount, type, and quality of activity. The results showed that during community ambulation, pwMS took fewer steps and walked more slowly, with greater asymmetry, and larger stride-to-stride variability, compared to the healthy controls (p < 0.001). Gait speed during most of community ambulation was significantly lower than the in-lab usual-walking value and similar to the in-lab dual-tasking value. Significant group (pwMS /controls)-by-walking condition (in-lab/community ambulation) interactions were observed (e.g., gait speed). Greater disability was associated with fewer steps and reduced gait speed during community ambulation. In contrast, physical fatigue was correlated with sedentary activity, but was not related to any of the measures of community ambulation gait quality including gait speed. This disparity suggests that more than one mechanism contributes to community ambulation and physical activity in pwMS. Together, these findings demonstrate that during community ambulation, pwMS have marked gait alterations in multiple gait features, reminiscent of dual-task walking measured in the laboratory. Disease-related factors associated with these changes might be targets of rehabilitation.";"Article";"10.1007/S00415-020-09759-7";"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14321459&id=doi:10.1007%2Fs00415-020-09759-7&atitle=A+wearable+sensor+identifies+alterations+in+community+ambulation+in+multiple+sclerosis%3A+contributors+to+real-world+gait+quality+and+physical+activity&stitle=J.+Neurol.&title=Journal+of+Neurology&volume=267&issue=7&spage=1912&epage=1921&aulast=Shema-Shiratzky&aufirst=Shirley&auinit=S.&aufull=Shema-Shiratzky+S.&coden=JNRYA&isbn=&pages=1912-1921&date=2020&auinit1=S&auinitm=";"Embase";"Yes";"";"";"yes";"";"";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

A major limitation in fall detection algorithm development is an absence of real-world falls data. Fall detection algorithms are typically trained on simulated fall data that contain a well-balanced number of examples of falls and activities of daily living. However, real-world falls occur infrequently, making them difficult to capture and causing severe data imbalance. People with multiple sclerosis (MS) fall frequently, and their risk of falling increases with disease progression. Because of their high fall incidence, people with MS provide an ideal model for studying falls. This paper describes the development of a context-aware fall detection system based on inertial sensors and time of flight sensors that is robust to imbalance, which is trained and evaluated on real-world falls in people with MS. The algorithm uses an auto-encoder that detects fall candidates using reconstruction error of accelerometer signals followed by a hyper-ensemble of balanced random forests trained using both acceleration and movement features. On a clinical dataset obtained from 25 people with MS monitored over eight weeks during free-living conditions, 54 falls were observed and our system achieved a sensitivity of 92.14%, and false-positive rate of 0.65 false alarms per day.";"Article in Press";"10.1109/JBHI.2020.3041035";"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=21682208&id=doi:10.1109%2FJBHI.2020.3041035&atitle=Automated+Detection+of+Real-World+Falls%3A+Modeled+from+People+with+Multiple+Sclerosis&stitle=IEEE+J.+Biomedical+Health+Informat.&title=IEEE+Journal+of+Biomedical+and+Health+Informatics&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Mosquera-Lopez&aufirst=Clara&auinit=C.&aufull=Mosquera-Lopez+C.&coden=ITIBF&isbn=&pages=-&date=2020&auinit1=C&auinitm=";"Embase";"Yes";"";"";"yes";"";"MotioWear";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

However, one overarching limitation of this research is that researchers have not recruited samples who have the actual problem of being studied (i.e., cognitive processing speed impairment). This study examined associations between device-measured PA and cognitive processing speed in a large sample of persons with MS overall and between those with and without cognitive processing speed impairment. METHOD: Three hundred eighty-five persons with MS underwent the oral Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) and wore an accelerometer for 7 days for PA measurement. We divided the overall sample into subsamples with (n = 140) and without (n = 245) cognitive processing speed impairment based on age, sex, and education-adjusted SDMT Z-scores. RESULTS: After controlling for age and disability status, higher levels of device-measured PA were significantly associated with faster cognitive processing speed overall, and the association was significantly stronger among persons with MS who presented with cognitive processing speed impairment. CONCLUSIONS: This examination provides initial cross-sectional support for informing the development of PA interventions as a possible approach for managing MS-related cognitive processing speed impairment.

Methods: We developed a smartphone application called MS Screen Test (MSST) to explore several dimensions of the neurological exam such as finger tapping speed, agility, hand synchronization, low contrast vision and cognition during a short evaluation. This app was tested on a cohort of healthy volunteers including a subset of subjects who underwent two evaluations on the same day to assess reproducibility. In a second step, the app was tested on a cohort of RIS subjects. Performances of RIS subjects were compared with age and genre-matched HC. Results: HC underwent two consecutive evaluations on MSST. The analysis showed good reproducibility for all measures. Then 21 RIS subjects were compared to 32 matched HC. Compared to HC, we found that RIS subjects had a lower finger tapping speed on the dominant hand (5.6 versus 6.5 taps per second; p = 0.005), a longer inter hand interval during the hand synchronization task (14.4 versus 11.3 ms; p = 0.03) and significantly poorer scores on the low contrast vision and cognition tests. Conclusion: MSST only requires a smartphone to obtain digital biomarkers relative to several dimensions of the neurological examination.

A quantitative study based on wearable accelerometers";"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health";2020;"In people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS), fatigue, weakness and spasticity may reduce mobility and promote sedentary behavior. However, little is known about the existence of possible differences in the way MS modifies the propensity to perform physical activity (PA) in men and women. The present study aimed to partly close this gap by means of quantitative analysis carried out using wearable sensors. Forty-five pwMS (23 F, 22 M, mean age 50.3) and 41 unaffected age-and sex-matched individuals wore a tri-axial accelerometer 24 h/day for 7 consecutive days. Raw data were processed to calculate average number of daily steps, vector magnitude (VM) counts, and percentage of time spent in sedentary behavior and in PA of different intensities (i.e., light and moderate-to-vigorous, MVPA). Women with MS spent more time in sedentary behavior and exhibited a reduced amount of light intensity activity with respect to men, while MVPA was similar across sexes. However, in comparison with unaffected individuals, the overall PA patterns appear significantly modified mostly in women who, in presence of the disease, present increased sedentary behavior, reduced MVPA, number of daily steps and VM counts.

As most gold standards measure infrequently and require clinician presence, fluctuations in the daily progression are not accounted for. Due to the underlying conditions of homogeneity and stationarity (the main tenets of ergodicity) not being met for the majority of the statistical methods employed in the clinical setting, alternative approaches should be investigated. A solution is to use a non-linear time series analysis approach. Here, Early-Warning Signals (EWS) in the form of critical fluctuations in Keystroke Dynamics (KD), collected using participant's smartphones, are investigated as indicators for a clinical change in three groups. These are patients with MS and changes in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), patients with MS but without changes in MRI, and healthy controls (HCs). Here, we report examples of EWS and changes in KD coinciding with clinically relevant changes in outcome measures in both patients with and without differences in the amount of MRI enhancing lesions. We also report no clinically relevant changes in EWS in the HC population.

Current monitoring practices predominantly rely on brief and infrequent assessments, which may not be representative of the real-world patient experience. Smartphone technology provides an opportunity to assess people's daily-lived experience of MS on a frequent, regular basis outside of episodic clinical evaluations. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to evaluate the feasibility and utility of capturing real-world MS-related health data remotely using a smartphone app, """"elevateMS,"""" to investigate the associations between self-reported MS severity and sensor-based active functional tests measurements, and the impact of local weather conditions on disease burden. METHODS: This was a 12-week, observational, digital health study involving 3 cohorts: self-referred participants who reported an MS diagnosis, clinic-referred participants with neurologist-confirmed MS, and participants without MS (controls). Participants downloaded the elevateMS app and completed baseline assessments, including self-reported physical ability (Patient-Determined Disease Steps [PDDS]), as well as longitudinal assessments of quality of life (Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders [Neuro-QoL] Cognitive, Upper Extremity, and Lower Extremity Function) and daily health (MS symptoms, triggers, health, mobility, pain). Participants also completed functional tests (finger-tapping, walk and balance, voice-based Digit Symbol Substitution Test [DSST], and finger-to-nose) as an independent assessment of MS-related cognition and motor activity. Local weather data were collected each time participants completed an active task. Associations between self-reported baseline/longitudinal assessments, functional tests, and weather were evaluated using linear (for cross-sectional data) and mixed-effects (for longitudinal data) regression models. RESULTS: A total of 660 individuals enrolled in the study; 31 withdrew, 495 had MS (n=359 self-referred, n=136 clinic-referred), and 134 were controls. Participation was highest in clinic-referred versus self-referred participants (median retention: 25.5 vs 7.0 days). The top 5 most common MS symptoms, reported at least once by participants with MS, were fatigue (310/495, 62.6%), weakness (222/495, 44.8%), memory/attention issues (209/495, 42.2%), and difficulty walking (205/495, 41.4%), and the most common triggers were high ambient temperature (259/495, 52.3%), stress (250/495, 50.5%), and late bedtime (221/495, 44.6%). Baseline PDDS was significantly associated with functional test performance in participants with MS (mixed model-based estimate of most significant feature across functional tests [β]: finger-tapping: β=-43.64, P<.001; DSST: β=-5.47, P=.005; walk and balance: β=-.39, P=.001; finger-to-nose: β=.01, P=.01). Longitudinal Neuro-QoL scores were also significantly associated with functional tests (finger-tapping with Upper Extremity Function: β=.40, P<.001; walk and balance with Lower Extremity Function: β=-99.18, P=.02; DSST with Cognitive Function: β=1.60, P=.03). Finally, local temperature was significantly associated with participants' test performance (finger-tapping: β=-.14, P<.001; DSST: β=-.06, P=.009; finger-to-nose: β=-53.88, P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The elevateMS study app captured the real-world experience of MS, characterized some MS symptoms, and assessed the impact of environmental factors on symptom severity. Our study provides further evidence that supports smartphone app use to monitor MS with both active assessments and patient-reported measures of disease burden. App-based tracking may provide unique and timely real-world data for clinicians and patients, resulting in improved disease insights and management.";"Article";"10.2196/22108";"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=22915222&id=doi:10.2196%2F22108&atitle=Evaluating+the+Utility+of+Smartphone-Based+Sensor+Assessments+in+Persons+With+Multiple+Sclerosis+in+the+Real-World+Using+an+App+%28elevateMS%29%3A+Observational%2C+Prospective+Pilot+Digital+Health+Study&stitle=JMIR+Mhealth+Uhealth&title=JMIR+mHealth+and+uHealth&volume=8&issue=10&spage=e22108&epage=&aulast=Pratap&aufirst=Abhishek&auinit=A.&aufull=Pratap+A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=e22108-&date=2020&auinit1=A&auinitm=";"Embase";"Yes";"";"";"yes";"";"";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Enhancing physical activity (PA) might promote neuroregeneration in multiple sclerosis (MS) and positively influence disability, thus providing an alternative to medical treatment. Previous studies indicate that evidence-based patient information (EBPI) is essential for inducing behavioral change, e.g. enhancing PA. Objective: To investigate feasibility of a smartphone app providing EBPI about the benefit of PA and a simple activity feedback to enhance PA in people with CPMS in a pilot randomized controlled trial over 3 months. Methods: Thirty-eight people with CPMS (mean age 51 years, median Expanded Disability Status Scale 4.0) were 1:1 randomized into either a control group (n = 20) or an intervention group (n = 18). The intervention group received access to a multimedia EBPI app including activity feedback, texts, figures and videos. In the control group, participants received a leaflet with unspecific information about exercising in general. The EPBI itself was designed based on a systematic review. At baseline and after 3 months, all participants underwent clinical performance tests, filled in questionnaires and received an activity monitor (Actigraph(Ò)) for 7 days. The primary endpoint was the rate of responders defined as participants with a 20% increase of physical acitivity (time of moderate or vigiorous PA—MVPA) or 20% increase of the number of steps, both assessed with the activity monitor. As secondary endpoints, we compared accelerometry, performance and questionnaires adjusted for baseline measurments between the groups (ANCOVA). Moreover, we used questionnaires to compare knowledge about exercise (activity requiring physical effort, carried out to improve or improve health and fitness) in MS, usability of the app in general and motivation towards a more active lifestyle after 3 months in both groups. Results: The groups showed significant differences in disease duration and PA according to the Godin–Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire at baseline. After 3 months, we detected no difference in the rate of responders, which was an overall 22%. However, MVPA significantly increased in both groups (p < 0.001) and the intervention group tended to have a higher motivation towards a more active lifestyle (Cohens D = 0.7, p = 0.09) as measured by the questionnaire. Reponses also showed, that participants appreciated the app but claimed a lack of interactivity as a shortcoming. Conclusion: Just providing information in a multimedia smartphone app did not enhance physical activitiy more than a simple leaflet in this small pilot trial in CPMS. However, the group of app users tended to have a higher motivation towards a more active lifestyle. Overall, the concept of a smartphone app to support an active lifestyle in MS is highly appreciated by participants.";"Article";"10.7717/PEERJ.9303";"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=21678359&id=doi:10.7717%2Fpeerj.9303&atitle=Feasibility+of+a+smartphone+app+to+enhance+physical+activity+in+progressive+MS%3A+A+pilot+randomized+controlled+pilot+trial+over+three+months&stitle=PeerJ&title=PeerJ&volume=2020&issue=6&spage=&epage=&aulast=Nasseri&aufirst=Navina+N.&auinit=N.N.&aufull=Nasseri+N.N.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2020&auinit1=N&auinitm=N";"Embase";"No";"Out of scope (topic)";"";"yes";"";"";"Included";"";"included";"accelerometer used as outcome measure, Actigraph";NA

The purpose of this study is to determine the test-retest reliability, standard error of measurement (SEM) and minimum detectable change (MDC) of features calculated on gait characteristics, harvested during a self-administered 2MWT in a home environment, in 51 PwMS and 11 healthy control (HC) subjects over 24 weeks, using a single waist-worn inertial sensor-based smartphone. Excellent, or good to excellent test-retest reliability were observed in 58 of the 92 temporal, spatial and spatiotemporal gait features in PwMS. However, these were less reliable for HCs. Low SEM% and MDC% values were observed for most of the distribution measures for all gait characteristics for PwMS and HCs. This study demonstrates the inter-session test-retest reliability and provides an indication of clinically important change estimates, for interpreting the outcomes of gait characteristics measured using a body-worn smartphone, during a self-administered 2MWT. This system thus provides a reliable measure of gait characteristics in PwMS, supporting its application for the longitudinal assessment of gait deficits in this population.";"Article";"10.3390/S20205906";"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14248220&id=doi:10.3390%2Fs20205906&atitle=Gait+Characteristics+Harvested+During+a+Smartphone-Based+Self-Administered+2-Minute+Walk+Test+in+People+with+Multiple+Sclerosis%3A+Test-Retest+Reliability+and+Minimum+Detectable+Change&stitle=Sensors+%28Basel%29&title=Sensors+%28Basel%2C+Switzerland%29&volume=20&issue=20&spage=&epage=&aulast=Bourke&aufirst=Alan+K.&auinit=A.K.&aufull=Bourke+A.K.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2020&auinit1=A&auinitm=K";"Embase";"Yes";"";"";"yes";"";"";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

However, differences in methods of determining stability such as sensor type and placements, may lead to different results and affect their interpretation when comparing to controls and other studies. Questions: Do people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) exhibit lower gait stability? Do location and type of data used to calculate stability metrics affect comparisons? Methods: 30 PwMS with no walking impairments as clinically measured and 15 healthy controls walked on a treadmill at 1.2 ms(?1) while 3D acceleration data was obtained from sacrum, shoulder and cervical markers and from an accelerometer placed at the sacrum. The local divergence exponent was calculated for the four data sources. An ANOVA with group (multiple sclerosis and control) and data source as main factors was used to determine the effect of disease, data source and their interaction on stability metrics. Results: PwMS walked with significantly less stability according to all sensors (no interaction). A significant effect of data source on stability was also found, indicating that the local divergence exponent derived from sacrum accelerometer was lower than that derived from the other 3 sensor locations. Significance: PwMS with no evident gait impairments are less stable than healthy controls when walking on a treadmill. Although different data sources can be used to determine MS-related stability deterioration, a consensus about location and data source is needed. The local divergence exponent can be a useful measure of progression of gait instability at early stages of MS.";"Article";"10.1016/J.GAITPOST.2020.02.006";"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=18792219&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.gaitpost.2020.02.006&atitle=Gait+stability+at+early+stages+of+multiple+sclerosis+using+different+data+sources&stitle=Gait+Posture&title=Gait+and+Posture&volume=77&issue=&spage=214&epage=217&aulast=Cofr%C3%A9+Lizama&aufirst=L.+Eduardo&auinit=L.E.&aufull=Cofr%C3%A9+Lizama+L.E.&coden=GAPOF&isbn=&pages=214-217&date=2020&auinit1=L&auinitm=E";"Embase";"Yes";"";"";"no";"Out of scope";"";"Included";"";"included";"";NA

Fatigue is the most common symptom in MS with a prevalence of 80%. Previous research studied the relation between fatigue and gait impairment using stationary gait analysis systems and short gait tests (e.g. timed 25 ft walk). However, wearable inertial sensors providing gait data from longer and continuous gait bouts have not been used to assess the relation between fatigue and gait parameters in MS. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the association between fatigue and spatio-temporal gait parameters extracted from wearable foot-worn sensors and to predict the degree of fatigue. Methods: Forty-nine patients with MS (32 women; 17 men; aged 41.6 years, EDSS 1.0–6.5) were included where each participant was equipped with a small Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) on each foot. Spatio-temporal gait parameters were obtained from the 6-min walking test, and the Borg scale of perceived exertion was used to represent fatigue. Gait parameters were normalized by taking the difference of averaged gait parameters between the beginning and end of the test to eliminate inter-individual differences. Afterwards, normalized parameters were transformed to principle components that were used as input to a Random Forest regression model to formulate the relationship between gait parameters and fatigue. Results: Six principal components were used as input to our model explaining more than 90% of variance within our dataset. Random Forest regression was used to predict fatigue. The model was validated using 10-fold cross validation and the mean absolute error was 1.38 points. Principal components consisting mainly of stride time, maximum toe clearance, heel strike angle, and stride length had large contributions (67%) to the predictions made by the Random Forest. Conclusions: The level of fatigue can be predicted based on spatio-temporal gait parameters obtained from an IMU based system. The results can help therapists to monitor fatigue before and after treatment and in rehabilitation programs to evaluate their efficacy. Furthermore, this can be used in home monitoring scenarios where therapists can monitor fatigue using IMUs reducing time and effort of patients and therapists.";"Article";"10.1186/S12984-020-00798-9";"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=17430003&id=doi:10.1186%2Fs12984-020-00798-9&atitle=Inertial+sensor-based+gait+parameters+reflect+patient-reported+fatigue+in+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=J.+NeuroEng.+Rehabil.&title=Journal+of+NeuroEngineering+and+Rehabilitation&volume=17&issue=1&spage=&epage=&aulast=Ibrahim&aufirst=Alzhraa+A.&auinit=A.A.&aufull=Ibrahim+A.A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2020&auinit1=A&auinitm=A";"Embase";"Yes";"";"";"yes";"";"";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Fatigue is a debilitating symptom in multiple sclerosis (MS) that may be associated with reduced physical activity and increased sedentary behavior. Objective. This study examined the associations among fatigue and device-measured physical activity and sedentary behavior in people with MS. Methods. The participants (n = 252) completed the Patient Determined Disease Steps (PDDS) and Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and wore a waist-mounted accelerometer for 7 days. Participants were divided into 2 groups based on fatigue severity as measured by the FSS scale. We compared percentage of wear time spent in sedentary, light physical activity (LPA), and moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) between the 2 groups. Results. Persons in the fatigued group (FSS score ≥ 4) spent a greater percentage of time in sedentary behavior (P =.004) and a lower percentage of time in LPA (P =.035). Persons in the fatigued group further spent a lower percentage of time in nontransformed MVPA (P <.001) and square-root-transformed MVPA (P <.001) than persons in the nonfatigued group. When controlling for PDDS scores and years of education, there were no longer significant differences between groups in sedentary behavior, LPA, or transformed MVPA values; the difference in nontransformed MVPA was still statistically significant but likely the result of nonnormally distributed data. Conclusion. The present study suggests that factors other than fatigue might be associated with physical activity and sedentary behavior in MS, and this group might benefit from focal behavioral interventions that take into account mobility status in persons with MS who have fatigue.";"Article";"10.1177/1545968320916159";"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=15526844&id=doi:10.1177%2F1545968320916159&atitle=Is+Symptomatic+Fatigue+Associated+With+Physical+Activity+and+Sedentary+Behaviors+Among+Persons+With+Multiple+Sclerosis%3F&stitle=Neurorehabil.+Neural+Repair&title=Neurorehabilitation+and+Neural+Repair&volume=34&issue=6&spage=505&epage=511&aulast=Neal&aufirst=Whitney+N.&auinit=W.N.&aufull=Neal+W.N.&coden=JNRHF&isbn=&pages=505-511&date=2020&auinit1=W&auinitm=N";"Embase";"Yes";"";"";"yes";"";"";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

As a step towards better understanding gait during daily life in neurological populations, we compared gait measures that best discriminated people with multiple sclerosis (MS) and people with Parkinson’s Disease (PD) from their respective, age-matched, healthy control subjects (MS-Ctl, PD-Ctl) in laboratory tests versus a week of daily life monitoring. Methods: We recruited 15 people with MS (age mean ± SD: 49 ± 10 years), 16 MS-Ctl (45 ± 11 years), 16 people with idiopathic PD (71 ± 5 years), and 15 PD-Ctl (69 ± 7 years). Subjects wore 3 inertial sensors (one each foot and lower back) in the laboratory followed by 7 days during daily life. Mann–Whitney U test and area under the curve (AUC) compared differences between PD and PD-Ctl, and between MS and MS-Ctl in the laboratory and in daily life. Results: Participants wore sensors for 60–68 h in daily life. Measures that best discriminated gait characteristics in people with MS and PD from their respective control groups were different between the laboratory gait test and a week of daily life. Specifically, the toe-off angle best discriminated MS versus MS-Ctl in the laboratory (AUC [95% CI] = 0.80 [0.63–0.96]) whereas gait speed in daily life (AUC = 0.84 [0.69–1.00]). In contrast, the lumbar coronal range of motion best discriminated PD versus PD-Ctl in the laboratory (AUC = 0.78 [0.59–0.96]) whereas foot-strike angle in daily life (AUC = 0.84 [0.70–0.98]). AUCs were larger in daily life compared to the laboratory. Conclusions: Larger AUC for daily life gait measures compared to the laboratory gait measures suggest that daily life monitoring may be more sensitive to impairments from neurological disease, but each neurological disease may require different gait outcome measures.";"Article";"10.1186/S12984-020-00781-4";"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=17430003&id=doi:10.1186%2Fs12984-020-00781-4&atitle=Laboratory+versus+daily+life+gait+characteristics+in+patients+with+multiple+sclerosis%2C+Parkinson%E2%80%99s+disease%2C+and+matched+controls&stitle=J.+NeuroEng.+Rehabil.&title=Journal+of+NeuroEngineering+and+Rehabilitation&volume=17&issue=1&spage=&epage=&aulast=Shah&aufirst=Vrutangkumar+V.&auinit=V.V.&aufull=Shah+V.V.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2020&auinit1=V&auinitm=V";"Embase";"Yes";"";"";"yes";"";"";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Currently clinicians rely on self-report measures or simple functional assessments, administered at discrete time points, to assess fall risk. Wearable inertial sensors are a promising technology for increasing the sensitivity of clinical assessments to accurately predict fall risk, but current accelerometer-based approaches are limited. Research question: Will metrics derived from wearable accelerometers during a 30-second chair stand test (30CST) correlate with clinical measures of disease severity, balance confidence and fatigue in PwMS, and can these metrics be used to accurately discriminate fallers from non-fallers? Methods: Thirty-eight PwMS (21 fallers) completed self-report outcome measures then performed the 30CST while triaxial acceleration data were collected from inertial sensors adhered to the thigh and chest. Accelerometer metrics were derived for the sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit transitions and relationships with clinical metrics were assessed. Finally, the metrics were used to develop a logistic regression model to classify fall status. Results: Accelerometer-derived metrics were significantly associated with multiple clinical metrics that capture disease severity, balance confidence and fatigue. Performance of a logistic regression for classifying fall status was enhanced by including accelerometer features (accuracy 74%, AUC 0.78) compared to the standard of care (accuracy 68%, AUC 0.74) or patient reported outcomes (accuracy 71%, AUC 0.75). Significance: Accelerometer derived metrics were associated with clinically relevant measures of disease severity, fatigue and balance confidence during a balance challenging task. Inertial sensors could feasibly be utilized to enhance the accuracy of functional assessments to identify fall risk in PwMS.

MSCopilot is a software medical device for the self-assessment of patients with MS (PwMS), combining four tests: walking, dexterity, cognition and low contrast vision. The objective was to validate MSCopilot versus the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC). Methods: This multicentre, open-label, randomized, controlled, crossover study enrolled 141 PwMS and 76 healthy controls (HCs). All participants performed MSCopilot and MSFC tests at day 0. To assess reproducibility, 46 PwMS performed the same tests at day 30 ± 3. The primary end-point was the validation of MSCopilot versus MSFC for the identification of PwMS against HCs, quantified using the area under the curve (AUC). The main secondary end-point was the correlation of MSCopilot z-scores with MSFC z-scores. Results: In all, 116 PwMS and 69 HCs were analysed. The primary end-point was achieved: MSCopilot performance was non-inferior to that of MSFC (AUC 0.92 and 0.89 respectively; P = 0.3).

Methods: Consecutive patients meeting the 2010 MS diagnostic criteria and healthy controls were offered enrollment. Participants completed finger and foot taps wearing the MYO-band© (accelerometer, gyroscope, and surface electromyogram sensors). Signal processing was performed to extract spatiotemporal features from raw sensor data. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) assessed intertest reproducibility. Spearman correlation and multivariable regression methods compared extracted features to physician- and patient-reported disability outcomes. Partial least squares regression identified the most informative extracted textural features. Results: Baseline data for 117 participants with MS (EDSS 1.0–7.0) and 30 healthy controls were analyzed. ICCs for final selected features ranged from 0.80 to 0.87. Time-based features distinguished cases from controls (P = 0.002). The most informative combination of extracted features from all three sensors strongly correlated with physician EDSS (finger taps r(s) = 0.77, P < 0.0001; foot taps r(s) = 0.82, P < 0.0001) and had equally strong associations with patient-reported outcomes (WHODAS, finger taps r(s) = 0.82, P < 0.0001; foot taps r(s) = 0.82, P < 0.0001). Associations remained with multivariable modeling adjusted for age and sex. Conclusions: Extracted features from the multi-sensor demonstrate striking correlations with gold standard outcomes. Ideal for future generalizability, the assessments take only a few minutes, can be performed by nonclinical personnel, and wearing the band is nondisruptive to routine practice.

Objectives: We investigated whether sensor-based gait analysis is able to detect gait impairments in patients with MS (PwMS). Methods: A foot-worn sensor-based gait analysis system was used in 102 PwMS and 22 healthy controls (HC) that were asked to perform the 25-foot walking test (25FWT) two times in a self-selected speed (25FWT_pref), followed by two times in a speed as fast as possible (25FWT_fast). The Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS-12) was used as a subjective measure of patient mobility. Patients were divided into EDSS and functional system subgroups. Results: Datasets between two consecutive measurements (test-retest-reliability) were highly correlated in all analysed mean gait parameters (e.g. 25FWT_fast: stride length r = 0.955, gait speed r = 0.969) Subgroup analysis between HC and PwMS with lower (EDSS≤3.5) and higher (EDSS 4.0–7.0) disability showed significant differences in mean stride length, gait speed, toe off angle, stance time and swing time (e.g. stride length of EDSS subgroups 25FWT_fast p ≤ 0.001, 25FWT_pref p = 0.003). The differences between EDSS subgroups were more pronounced in fast than in self-selected gait speed (e.g. stride length 25FWT_fast 33.6 cm vs. 25FWT_pref 16.3 cm). Stride length (25FWT_fast) highly correlated to EDSS (r=-0.583) and MSWS-12 (r=-0.668). We observed significant differences between HC and PwMS with (FS 0–1) and without (FS≥2) pyramidal or cerebellar disability (e.g. gait speed of FS subgroups p ≤ 0.001). Conclusion: Sensor-based gait analysis objectively supports the clinical assessment of gait abnormalities even in the lower stages of MS, especially when walking with fast speed. Stride length and gait speed where identified as the most clinically relevant gait measures. Thus, it may be used to support the assessment of PwMS with gait impairment in the future, e.g. for more objective classification of disability.

Inertial measurement units (IMUs) provide reliable and yet easy quantitative gait assessment in routine clinical settings. However, to the best of our knowledge, no automated step-detection algorithm performs well in detecting severely altered pMS gait. Method: This article elaborates on a step-detection method based on personalized templates tested against a gold standard. Twenty-two individuals with pMS and 10 young healthy subjects (HSs) were instructed to walk on an electronic walkway wearing synchronized IMUs. Templates were derived from the IMU signals by using Initial and Final Contact times given by the walkway. These were used to detect steps from other gait trials of the same individual (intra-individual template-based detection, IITD) or another participant from the same group (pMS or HS) (intra-group template-based detection, IGTD). All participants were seen twice with a 6-month interval, with two measurements performed at each visit. Performance and accuracy metrics were computed, along with a similarity index (SId), which was computed as the mean distance between detected steps and their respective closest template. Results: For HS participants, both the IITD and the IGTD algorithms had precision and recall of 1.00 for detecting steps. For pMS participants, precision and recall ranged from 0.94 to 1.00 for IITD and 0.85 to 0.95 for IGTD depending on the level of disability. The SId was correlated with performance and the accuracy of the result. An SId threshold of 0.957 (IITD) and 0.963 (IGTD) could rule out decreased performance (F-measure ? 0.95), with negative predictive values of 0.99 and 0.96 with the IITD and IGTD algorithms. Also, the SId computed with the IITD and IGTD algorithms could distinguish individuals showing changes at 6-month follow-up. Conclusion: This personalized step-detection method has high performance for detecting steps in pMS individuals with severely altered gait. The algorithm can be self-evaluating with the SI, which gives a measure of the confidence the clinician can have in the detection. What is more, the SId can be used as a biomarker of change in disease severity occurring between the two measurement times.";"Article";"10.3389/FNEUR.2020.00261";"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=16642295&id=doi:10.3389%2Ffneur.2020.00261&atitle=Personalized+Template-Based+Step+Detection+From+Inertial+Measurement+Units+Signals+in+Multiple+Sclerosis&stitle=Front.+Neurol.&title=Frontiers+in+Neurology&volume=11&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Vienne-Jumeau&aufirst=Ali%C3%A9nor&auinit=A.&aufull=Vienne-Jumeau+A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2020&auinit1=A&auinitm=";"Embase";"Yes";"";"";"no";"Out of scope";"";"Out of scope (topic)";"";"included";"";"in"

MS results in declines in physical activity and peak oxygen consumption that might be independently associated with declines in walking performance. Therefore our purpose was to evaluate the association between physical activity and peak oxygen consumption with walking performance in individuals with MS. Methods: Fifty individuals with MS between the ages of 18–70 yrs. (Female: 38; 46 ± 12 yrs.; BMI: 28.5 ± 6.4; EDSS: 3.3 [IQR: 2.5–4]) performed a maximal incremental cycle test to assess peak oxygen consumption (VO(2peak)), and wore an accelerometer for one week to measure moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Subjects further completed a timed 25-foot walk test (T25FW) and 6-minute walk (6MW) to measure walking performance. Results: MVPA and VO(2)peak were correlated with 6MW and T25FW (p < 0.05). When combined in multivariate regression analyses, VO(2peak) and MVPA were both significant contributors of T25FW speed and 6MW, but after controlling for sex and age, MVPA was the only significant contributor (? = 0.32 and ? = 0.44, respectively). Conclusion: Both higher MVPA and VO(2peak) were associated with better walking performance and in a combined model physical activity, but not peak oxygen consumption, remained an independent contributor to walking performance in individuals with MS. These results suggest that improving MVPA is a potential target for interventions to improve walking performance in persons with MS.";"Article";"10.1016/J.MSARD.2020.101941";"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=22110356&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.msard.2020.101941&atitle=Physical+activity+and+peak+oxygen+consumption+are+associated+with+walking+in+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+Relat.+Disord.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+and+Related+Disorders&volume=40&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Hibner&aufirst=Brooks+A.&auinit=B.A.&aufull=Hibner+B.A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2020&auinit1=B&auinitm=A";"Embase";"No";"Out of scope (topic)";"";"yes";"";"";"Included";"";"included";"accelerometer used as outcome measure";NA

Objective: To validate RAM in progressive MS using (1) traditional psychometric methods (2) brain atrophy. Methods: 56 people with progressive MS participated in a longitudinal study over 2.5 years. An arm-worn RAM device measured activity over six days, every six months, and incorporated triaxial accelerometry and transcutaneous physiological variable measurement. Five RAM variables were assessed: physical activity duration, step count, active energy expenditure, metabolic equivalents and a composite RAM score incorporating all four variables. Other assessments every six months included EDSS, MSFC, MSIS-29, Chalder Fatigue Scale and Beck’s Depression Inventory. Annualized brain atrophy was measured using SIENA. Results: RAM was tolerated well by people with MS; the device was worn 99.4% of the time. RAM had good convergent and divergent validity and was responsive, especially with respect to step count.

To successfully perform rapid repetitive movements such as tapping, a person must be able to consistently turn on and off motor units to switch between the up and down movement phases. However, it is not clear which specific movement phase that occurs during tapping is different between MS subtypes. The objective of this study was to quantify and characterize performance differences during rapid hand- and foot-tapping tests between relapsing-remitting (RRMS) and progressive (PMS) forms of MS, as well as how both subtypes differ from non-MS controls. Methods: Participants in this study included 30 non-MS controls, 32 RRMS, and 31 PMS. Participants wore inertial sensors on all hands and feet and were instructed to tap as fast as possible for 10 s. Angular velocity from the gyroscope was used to quantify inter-tap interval (ms), coefficient of variation of inter-tap interval (COV), and up- and down-movement characteristics (duration (ms), COV, peak angular velocity (rad/s)). Differences between groups were examined with ANOVA and independent t-tests. Inter-tap interval was examined for its ability to distinguish between RRMS and PMS by a binary logistic regression analysis. Up-down movement characteristics were further evaluated for within-group directional differences (up- vs. down-phase movement components) with paired-sample t-tests. Results: Inter-tap interval for both hand- and foot-tapping differed between controls and MS, but only foot tapping was different between RRMS and PMS (RRMS = 286.7 ± 83.0 ms; PMS = 379.5 ± 170.9 ms; mean difference (d) = -92.8 ms). Logistic regression analysis showed foot-tap interval but not hand-tap interval has the potential to distinguish between RRMS and PMS (Area under the ROC = 0.71). Both up- and down-movement duration differences were consistent with the results for inter-tap interval, but up-movement duration showed larger mean group differences than down-movement differences. No significant group differences in overall inter-tap interval COV were detected for either hand- or foot-tapping; however, up-movement foot-tapping variation (CON = 18.7 ± 6.1; RRMS = 25.5 ± 11.2; PMS = 23.3 ± 8.6; CON vs RRMS d = -6.8; CON vs PMS d = -4.7), but not down-movement variation was different between controls and MS. Up- and down-peak angular velocity during foot-tapping were different between controls and PMS (CON Up = 1.4 ± 0.5 rad/s; PMS Up = 1.0 ± 0.4 rad/s; Up d = 0.4 rad/s; CON Down= 1.5 ± 0.6 rad/s; PMS Down = 1.2 ± 0.5 rad/s; Down d = 0.3 rad/s), and up-movement peak angular velocity differences showed larger mean group differences than the down-movement peak angular velocity between controls and PMS. Conclusion: Foot-tapping differs between MS disease subtypes and has greater potential than hand-tapping to distinguish between subtypes. Performance in the up-movement showed larger group differences than the down-movement, suggesting that the anti-gravity up-movement during tapping may be more important diagnostically.

METHODS: In total, 102 MS patients and 24 controls were included in this observational study. Keyboard interactions were obtained with the Neurokeys keyboard app. Eight timing-related keystroke features were assessed for reliability with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs); construct validity by analysing group differences (in fatigue, gadolinium-enhancing lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and patients vs controls); and concurrent validity by correlating with disability measures. RESULTS: Reliability was moderate in two (ICC = 0.601 and 0.742) and good to excellent in the remaining six features (ICC = 0.760-0.965).

This paper evaluates a novel approach to (1) determine the effects of the length of the walking task on the reliability of calculated measures and (2) identify digital biomarkers for gait assessments from fragmented data. Thirty-seven participants (37) diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS (EDSS range 0 to 4.5) executed two trials, walking 20 m each, with inertial sensors attached to their right and left shanks. Gait events were identified from the medio-lateral angular velocity, and short bouts of gait data were extracted from each trial, with lengths varying from 3 to 9 gait cycles. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) evaluate the degree of agreement between the two trials of each participant, according to the number of gait cycles included in the analysis. Results show that short bouts of gait data, including at least six gait cycles of bilateral data, can provide reliable gait measurements for persons with MS, opening new perspectives for gait assessment using fragmented data (e.g., wearable devices, community assessments).

Commercial research-based accelerometers are considered to be more valuable as they measure real-life mobility. Smartphone accelerometry might be an easily accessible alternative. Objective: To explore smartphone accelerometry in comparison to clinical tests, surveys, and a wrist-worn ActiGraph in pwMS and controls. Methods: Sixty-seven pwMS and 70 matched controls underwent mobility tests and surveys. Real-life data were collected with a smartphone and an ActiGraph over 7 days. We explored different smartphone metrics in a technical validation course and computed afterward correlation between ActiGraph (steps per minute), smartphone accelerometry (variance of vector magnitude), clinical tests, and surveys. We also determined the ability to separate between patients and controls as well as between different disability groups. Results: Based on the technical validation, we found the variance of the vector magnitude as a reliable estimate to discriminate wear time and no wear-time of the smartphone. Due to a further association with different activity levels, it was selected for real-life analyses. In the cross-sectional study, ActiGraph correlated moderately (r = 0.43, p < 0.05) with the smartphone but less with clinical tests (rho between |0.211| and |0.337|). Smartphone data showed stronger correlations with age (rho = −0.487) and clinical tests (rho between |0.565| and |0.605|). ActiGraph only differed between pwMS and controls (p < 0.001) but not between disability groups. At the same time, the smartphone showed differences between pwMS and controls, between RRMS and PP-/SPMS, and between participants with/without ambulatory impairment (all p < 0.001). Conclusions: Smartphone accelerometry provides better estimates of mobility and disability than a wrist-worn standard accelerometer in a free-living context for both controls and pwMS.

We describe the Draw a Shape (DaS) Test, a smartphone-based and remotely administered test of Upper Extremity (UE) function developed for people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). This work introduces DaS-related features that characterise UE function and impairment, and aims to demonstrate how multivariate modelling of these metrics can reliably predict the 9-Hole Peg Test (9HPT), a clinician-administered UE assessment in PwMS. APPROACH: The DaS Test instructed PwMS and healthy controls (HC) to trace predefined shapes on a smartphone screen. A total of 93 subjects (HC, n = 22; PwMS, n = 71) contributed both dominant and non-dominant handed DaS tests. PwMS subjects were characterised as those with normal (nPwMS, n = 50) and abnormal UE function (aPwMS, n = 21) with respect to their average 9HPT time (≤ or > 22.7 (s), respectively). L 1-regularization techniques, combined with linear least squares (OLS, IRLS), or non-linear support vector (SVR) or random forest (RFR) regression were investigated as functions to map relevant DaS features to 9HPT times. MAIN RESULTS: It was observed that average non-dominant handed 9HPT times were more accurately predicted by DaS features (r 2 = 0.41, [Formula: see text] 0.05; MAE: 2.08 ± 0.34 (s)) than average dominant handed 9HPTs (r 2 = 0.39, [Formula: see text] 0.05; MAE: 2.32 ± 0.43 (s)), using simple linear IRLS ([Formula: see text] 0.01). Moreover, it was found that the Mean absolute error (MAE) in predicted 9HPTs was comparable to the variability of actual 9HPT times within HC, nPwMS and aPwMS groups respectively. The 9HPT however exhibited large heteroscedasticity resulting in less stable predictions of longer 9HPT times. SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrates the potential of the smartphone-based DaS Test to reliably predict 9HPT times and remotely monitor UE function in PwMS.";"Article";"10.1088/1361-6579/AB8771";"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13616579&id=doi:10.1088%2F1361-6579%2Fab8771&atitle=Smartphone-based+remote+assessment+of+upper+extremity+function+for+multiple+sclerosis+using+the+Draw+a+Shape+Test&stitle=Physiol+Meas&title=Physiological+measurement&volume=41&issue=5&spage=054002&epage=&aulast=Creagh&aufirst=A.P.&auinit=A.P.&aufull=Creagh+A.P.&coden=&isbn=&pages=054002-&date=2020&auinit1=A&auinitm=P";"Embase";"Yes";"";"Biogen";"yes";"";"";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Technological advances in biomechanics offer objective assessments of gait disabilities in clinical settings. Here we employed wearable sensors to measure electromyography (EMG) and body acceleration during walking and to quantify the altered gait pattern between people with progressive MS (PwPMS) and healthy controls (HCs). Forty consecutive patients attending our department as in-patients were examined together with fifteen healthy controls. All subjects performed the timed 10 min walking test (T10MW) using a wearable accelerator and 8 electrodes attached to bilateral thighs and legs so that body acceleration and EMG activity were recorded. The T10MWs were recorded under three conditions: standard (wearing shoes), reduced grip (wearing socks) and increased cognitive load (backward-counting dual-task). PwPMS showed worse kinematics of gait and increased muscle coactivation than controls at both the thigh and leg levels. Both reduced grip and increased cognitive load caused a reduction in the cadence and velocity of the T10MW, which were correlated with one another. A higher coactivation index at the thigh level of the more affected side was positively correlated with the time of the T10MW (r = 0.5, p < 0.01), Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) (r = 0.4, p < 0.05), and negatively correlated with the cadence (r = -0.6, p < 0.001). Our results suggest that excessive coactivation at the thigh level is the major determinant of the gait performance as the disease progresses.

This assessor-blinded, randomized crossover study included 26 PwMS, 16 females, mean age 47.9 and median EDSS score 4.5. Participants attended two sessions: SVT and control training. Exercises for both the SVT and control sessions were based on ball-catching tasks. Training sessions were identical in length (40–50 min) and type of exercise drills. The difference between the two practice regimes was that the SVT session was performed wearing stroboscopic glasses and the control training was performed with similar glasses without lenses. Cognition was evaluated by a computerized software (Mindstreams(®), NeuroTrax Corp., NY). Gait and balance were evaluated via wearable accelerometers (APDM, Oregon, USA). Outcome measures were collected twice during a single session, prior to training and immediately afterward. Information processing speed (p = 0.003) increased at the post-evaluation compared with baseline, solely in the SVT session.

The purpose of this study was to determine how relationships between trunk and foot acceleration variability relate to physiological impairments, clinical disability scales, and mobility questionnaires in persons with multiple sclerosis. Methods: 15 fallers and 25 non-fallers with multiple sclerosis walked on a treadmill at normal walking speed while trunk and foot accelerations were recorded with wireless accelerometers and variability measures were extracted and used to calculate the gait stability index metrics as a ratio of trunk acceleration variability divided foot acceleration variability. Subjects' sensorimotor delays and lower extremity vibration sensitivity were tested. Subjects also completed clinical disability scales (Guy's Neurological Disability Scale and Patient Reported Expanded Disability Status Scale) and mobility questionnaires (Falls Efficacy Scale, Activities Balance Confidence Scale, 12 Item Multiple Sclerosis Walk Scale). Findings: Multiple gait stability index metrics were significantly correlated with clinical measures of disability and mobility in multiple sclerosis subjects (r = 0.354–0.528), but no correlations were found for sensorimotor delays or lower extremity sensation. Multiple gait stability indices performed at least as well as clinical questionnaires for separating fallers from non-fallers.

This project examined the utility of a head-worn inertial measurement unit (IMU) to quantify head movement frequency, velocity, and amplitude during gaze stability exercises. METHODS: Twenty-eight individuals with multiple sclerosis and complaints of dizziness or a history of falls were randomly assigned to either a strength and aerobic exercise (SAE) or gaze and postural stability (GPS) group. During a 6-week intervention, participants wore a head-mounted IMU 3 times (early, middle, and late). For aim 1, the frequency, mean peak velocity, and mean peak amplitude of head turns during equivalent duration components of group-specific exercises were compared using general linear models. For aim 2, the progression of treatment in the GPS group was examined using general linear regression models for each outcome. RESULTS: Aim 1 revealed the GPS group demonstrated significantly greater velocity and amplitude head turns during treatment than the SAE group. The frequency of head turns did not significantly differ between the 2 groups. The aim 2 analyses demonstrated that the yaw and pitch frequency of head turns significantly increased during gaze stability exercises over the 6-week intervention. Velocity and amplitude of head turns during yaw and pitch gaze stability exercises did not significantly change. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: A head-worn IMU during rehabilitation distinguished between groups. Furthermore, within the GPS group, the IMU quantified the progression of the frequency of head movements during gaze stability exercises over time.Video Abstract available for more insights from the authors (see the Video, Supplemental Digital Content 1, available at: http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A320).";"Article";"10.1097/NPT.0000000000000329";"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=15570584&id=doi:10.1097%2FNPT.0000000000000329&atitle=Turning+Toward+Monitoring+of+Gaze+Stability+Exercises%3A+The+Utility+of+Wearable+Sensors&stitle=J+Neurol+Phys+Ther&title=Journal+of+neurologic+physical+therapy+%3A+JNPT&volume=44&issue=4&spage=261&epage=267&aulast=Loyd&aufirst=Brian+J.&auinit=B.J.&aufull=Loyd+B.J.&coden=&isbn=&pages=261-267&date=2020&auinit1=B&auinitm=J";"Embase";"Yes";"";"";"no";"Out of scope";"Occulomotor assessment";"Included";"";"Out of scope (topic)";"";"in"

Fifteen gait measures were computed from the sensor data and tested for between-session reliability, for differences between controls and people with moderate and severe MS disability, and for correlation with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores. The majority of gait measures showed good to excellent between-session reliability when assessed in a subgroup of 23 healthy controls and 25 people with MS. These measures showed that people with MS walked with significantly longer step and stride durations, reduced step and stride regularity, and experienced difficulties in controlling and maintaining a stable walk when compared to controls. These abnormalities significantly increased in people with a higher level of disability and correlated with their EDSS scores.

Yet fall prevention interventions are not often prescribed until after a fall has been reported to a healthcare provider. While still nascent, objective fall risk assessments could help in prescribing preventative interventions. To this end, retrospective fall status classification commonly serves as an intermediate step in developing prospective fall risk assessments. Previous research has identified measures of gait biomechanics that differ between PwMS who have fallen and those who have not, but these biomechanical indices have not yet been leveraged to detect PwMS who have fallen. Moreover, they require the use of laboratory-based measurement technologies, which prevent clinical deployment. Here we demonstrate that a bidirectional long short-term (BiLSTM) memory deep neural network was able to identify PwMS who have recently fallen with good performance (AUC of 0.88) based on accelerometer data recorded from two wearable sensors during a one-minute walking task. These results provide substantial improvements over machine learning models trained on spatiotemporal gait parameters (21% improvement in AUC), statistical features from the wearable sensor data (16%), and patient-reported (19%) and neurologist-administered (24%) measures in this sample.

Instrumented gait analysis provides a plethora of metrics for quantifying concurrent factors contributing to gait deterioration. However, a gait model discriminating underlying features contributing to this deterioration is lacking in pwMS. This study aimed at developing and validating such a model. Methods: The gait of 24 healthy controls and 114 pwMS with mild, moderate, or severe disability was measured with inertial sensors on the shanks and lower trunk while walking for 6 minutes along a hospital corridor. Twenty out of thirty-six initially explored metrics computed from the sensor data met the quality criteria for exploratory factor analysis. This analysis provided the sought model, which underwent a confirmatory factor analysis before being used to characterize gait impairment across the three disability groups. Results: A gait model consisting of five domains (rhythm/variability, pace, asymmetry, and forward and lateral dynamic balance) was revealed by the factor analysis, which was able to highlight gait abnormalities across the disability groups: significant alterations in rhythm/variability-, asymmetry-, and pace-based features were present in the mild group, but these were more profound in the moderate and severe groups. Deterioration in dynamic balance-based features was only noted in pwMS with a moderate and severe disability. Conclusion: A conceptual model of gait for disease-specific mobility assessment in pwMS was successfully developed and tested.

Metrics of within-patient limb progression were created by combining the change in signal waveform features over time. The resulting upper (UE) and lower (LE) extremity metrics’ discrimination of progressive versus relapsing MS were evaluated with calculation of AUROC. Comparisons with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores were made with Pearson correlation. Results: Participants included 53 relapsing and 15 progressive MS (72% female, baseline mean age 48 years, median disease duration 11 years, median EDSS 2.5, median 10 months follow-up). The final summary metrics differentiated relapsing from secondary progressive MS with AUROC UE 0.93 and LE 0.96. The metrics were associated with baseline EDSS (UE P = 0.0003, LE P = 0.0007). While most had no change in EDSS during the short follow-up, several had evidence of progression by the multisensor metrics. Interpretation: Within a short follow-up interval, this novel multisensor algorithm distinguished progressive from relapsing MS and captured changes in limb function. Inexpensive, noninvasive and easy to use, this novel outcome is readily adaptable to clinical practice and trials as a MS vital sign. This approach also holds promise to monitor limb dysfunction in other neurological diseases.";"Article";"10.1002/ACN3.51187";"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=23289503&id=doi:10.1002%2Facn3.51187&atitle=Biosensor+vital+sign+detects+multiple+sclerosis+progression&stitle=Ann.+Clin.+Transl.+Neurol.&title=Annals+of+Clinical+and+Translational+Neurology&volume=8&issue=1&spage=4&epage=14&aulast=Krysko&aufirst=Kristen+M.&auinit=K.M.&aufull=Krysko+K.M.&coden=&isbn=&pages=4-14&date=2021&auinit1=K&auinitm=M";"Embase";"Yes";"";"";"yes";"";"";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

It is also not known how different definitions of a gait bout in daily life monitoring affects the ability to distinguish pathological gait quality. Specifically, how many seconds of a pause with no walking indicates an end to one gait bout and the start of another bout? In this study, we investigated the effect of 3 gait bout definitions on the discriminative ability to distinguish quality of walking in people with multiple sclerosis (MS) from healthy control subjects (HC) during a week of daily living. Methods: 15 subjects with MS and 16 HC wore instrumented socks on each foot and one Opal sensor over the lower lumbar area for a week of daily activities for at least 8 h/day. Three gait bout definitions were based on the length of the pause between the end of one gait bout and start of another bout (1.25 s, 2.50 s, and 5.0 s pause). Area under the curve (AUC) was used to compare gait quality measures in MS versus HC. Results: Total number of gait bouts over the week were statistically significantly different across bout definitions, as expected. However, AUCs of gait quality measures (such as gait speed, stride length, stride time) discriminating people with MS from HC were not different despite the 3 bout definitions. Significance: Quality of gait measures that discriminate MS from HC during daily life are not influenced by the length of a gait bout, despite large differences in quantity of gait across bout definitions. Thus, gait quality measures in people with MS versus controls can be compared across studies using different gait bout definitions with pause lengths ?5 s.";"Article";"10.1016/J.GAITPOST.2020.11.024";"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=18792219&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.gaitpost.2020.11.024&atitle=Does+gait+bout+definition+influence+the+ability+to+discriminate+gait+quality+between+people+with+and+without+multiple+sclerosis+during+daily+life%3F&stitle=Gait+Posture&title=Gait+and+Posture&volume=84&issue=&spage=108&epage=113&aulast=Shah&aufirst=Vrutangkumar+V.&auinit=V.V.&aufull=Shah+V.V.&coden=GAPOF&isbn=&pages=108-113&date=2021&auinit1=V&auinitm=V";"Embase";"No";"Out of scope (topic)";"";"yes";"";"";"Included";"";"included";"";NA

How-ever, little is known about how to tailor activity pacing for people with multiple sclerosis. This study aims to evaluate the effect of a tailored activity pacing intervention on fatigue and physical activity behaviours in adults with multiple sclerosis. Twenty-one adults with multiple sclerosis, stratified by age and gender, are randomly allocated to either a tailored pacing or control group. Participants wear an accelerometer for seven days that measures physical activity behaviours, and self-report fatigue at the baseline and four-week follow-up. Physical activity behaviours are assessed by exam-ining activity level (seven-day average activity counts per minute) and activity variability (seven-day average highest activity counts each day divided by activity counts on that day). The intervention improves activity levels (Mean difference = 40.91; 95% Confidence Interval [CI] (3.84–77.96); p = 0.03) and lessens activity variability (Mean difference = –0.63; 95% CI (?1.25–0.02); p = 0.04).

The development of objective methods of tremor characterisation to assess intervention efficacy and disease progression is therefore important. The possibility of using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) method for tremor detection was explored. Methods Acceleration from a wrist-worn device was analysed using FFTs to identify and characterise tremor magnitude and frequency. Processing parameters were explored to provide insight into the optimal algorithm. Participants wore a wrist tri-axial accelerometer during 9 tasks. The FAHN clinical assessment of tremor was used as the reference standard. Results Five people with MS and tremor (57.6 +/- 15.3 years, 3 F/2M) and ten disease-free controls (42.4 +/- 10.9 years, 5 M/5F) took part. Using specific algorithm settings tremor identification was possible (peak frequency 3-15Hz; magnitude greater than 0.06 g; 2 s windows with 50% overlap; using 2 of 3 axes of acceleration), giving sensitivity 0.974 and specificity 0.971 (38 tremor occurrences out of 108 tasks, 1 false positive, 2 false negatives). Tremor had frequency 3.5-13.0 Hz and amplitude 0.07-2.60g. Conclusions Upper limb tremor in people with MS can be detected using a FFT approach based on acceleration recorded at the wrist, demonstrating the possibility of using this minimally encumbering technique within clinical practice.";"Article";"10.1177/2055668320966955";"WOS:000617331400001";"WoS";"Yes";"";"";"yes";"";"";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Lab-based technology to measure posture is precise but expensive, and clinical tests may not capture underlying impairments. An alternative solution is to leverage smartphone accelerometry as it is affordable, ubiquitous, and portable. Research question: : Can smartphone accelerometry measure postural control compared to a force plate and research grade accelerometer in pwMS, and can smartphone accelerometry discriminate between assisted device and non-assisted device users? Methods: 27 pwMS (12 assisted device users, 15 non-assisted device users) stood on a force plate while holding a smartphone with an attached research grade accelerometer against their chest. Participants performed two, 30 s trials of: eyes open, eyes closed, semi-tandem, tandem, and single leg. Acceleration and center of pressure were extracted, and Root Mean Square (RMS) and 95 % confidence ellipse were calculated. Spearman's correlations were performed, and receiving operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) were calculated. Results: There were moderate to high correlations between the smartphone and accelerometer for RMS (ρ = 0.85 – 1.0; p = 0.001 – <0.001) and 95 % area ellipse (ρ = 0.92 – 0.99; p = <0.001). There were weak to moderate correlations between the smartphone and force plate for RMS (ρ = 0.38 – 0.92; p = 0.06 – <0.001) and 95 % area ellipse (ρ = 0.69 – 0.90 p = 0.002 – <0.001). To discriminate between assisted device usage, ROC curves for smartphone outputs were constructed, the AUC was high and statistically significant (p < 0.001 – 0.02). Significance: There is potential to leverage smartphone accelerometery to measure postural control in pwMS. These finding provide preliminary results to support the development of a mobile health application to measure fall risk for pwMS.";"Article";"10.1016/J.GAITPOST.2020.11.011";"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=18792219&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.gaitpost.2020.11.011&atitle=Smartphone+accelerometry+to+assess+postural+control+in+individuals+with+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Gait+Posture&title=Gait+and+Posture&volume=84&issue=&spage=114&epage=119&aulast=Hsieh&aufirst=Katherine+L.&auinit=K.L.&aufull=Hsieh+K.L.&coden=GAPOF&isbn=&pages=114-119&date=2021&auinit1=K&auinitm=L";"Embase";"Yes";"";"";"yes";"";"";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

This study explores the feasibility of assessing PwMS and Healthy Control's (HC) physical function by characterising gait-related features, which can be modelled using machine learning (ML) techniques to correctly distinguish subgroups of PwMS from healthy controls. A total of 97 subjects (24 HC subjects, 52 mildly disabled (PwMSmild, EDSS [0-3]) and 21 moderately disabled (PwMSmod, EDSS [3.5-5.5]) contributed data which was recorded from a Two-Minute Walk Test (2MWT) performed out-of-clinic and daily over a 24-week period. Signal-based features relating to movement were extracted from sensors in smartphone and smartwatch devices. A large number of features (n = 156) showed fair-to-strong (R > 0.3) correlations with clinical outcomes. LASSO feature selection was applied to select and rank subsets of features used for dichotomous classification between subject groups, which were compared using Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) models. Classifications of subject types were compared using data obtained from smartphone, smartwatch and the fusion of features from both devices. Models built on smartphone features alone achieved the highest classification performance, indicating that accurate and remote measurement of the ambulatory characteristics of HC and PwMS can be achieved with only one device. It was observed however that smartphone-based performance was affected by inconsistent placement location (running belt versus pocket). Results show that PwMSmod could be distinguished from HC subjects (Acc. 82.2 ± 2.9%, Sen. 80.1 ± 3.9%, Spec. 87.2 ± 4.2%, F1 84.3 ± 3.8), and PwMSmild (Acc. 82.3 ± 1.9%, Sen. 71.6 ± 4.2%, Spec. 87.0 ± 3.2%, F1 75.1 ± 2.2) using an SVM classifier with a Radial Basis Function (RBF). PwMSmild were shown to exhibit HC-like behaviour and were thus less distinguishable from HC (Acc. 66.4 ± 4.5%, Sen. 67.5 ± 5.7%, Spec. 60.3 ± 6.7%, F1 58.6 ± 5.8).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants were recruited through a standardised invitation letter distributed among 1000 persons randomly selected from the North American Research Committee on MS registry. Those who volunteered wore an accelerometer for 7 d and provided sociodemographic and clinical information. RESULTS: There were 233 persons with MS who were included in the analyses. Linear regression analyses indicated that age and MS type explained significant variance in total sedentary time per day as well as number of breaks in sedentary time. Only disability status explained significant variance in sedentary bout length, whereas age explained significant variance in both number of long sedentary bouts per day. Both age and disability status explained significant variance total time spent in long sedentary bouts per day. CONCLUSIONS: Persons of older age, progressive MS, and higher disability status spend prolonged, uninterrupted periods of time sedentary. Such results highlight the need for targeted interventions in sub-populations of MS that reduce time spent sedentary and break up the pattern of sedentary behaviour. Implications for Rehabilitation Sedentary behaviour is highly prevalent in multiple sclerosis and may be associated with comorbid conditions. The majority of research on sedentary behaviour in multiple sclerosis has been derived from self-report instruments that only measure the volume of sitting time per day. This study indicates that persons with multiple sclerosis spend a significant amount of time sedentary, and those who are older, have progressive multiple sclerosis, and have higher disability status spend prolonged, uninterrupted periods of time sedentary. Such results highlight the need for targeted behavioural interventions in these sub-populations of multiple sclerosis to reduce time spent sedentary and break the pattern of sedentary behaviour to manage its consequences.";"Article";"10.1080/09638288.2019.1614683";"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14645165&id=doi:10.1080%2F09638288.2019.1614683&atitle=Sociodemographic+and+clinical+correlates+of+device-measured+sedentary+behaviour+in+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Disabil+Rehabil&title=Disability+and+rehabilitation&volume=43&issue=1&spage=42&epage=48&aulast=Jeng&aufirst=Brenda&auinit=B.&aufull=Jeng+B.&coden=&isbn=&pages=42-48&date=2021&auinit1=B&auinitm=";"Embase";"Yes";"";"";"yes";"";"";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

We have developed a smartphone-based assessment of ambulation performance, the 5 U-Turn Test (5UTT), a quantitative self-administered test of U-turn ability while walking, for people with MS (PwMS). Research question: What is the test-retest reliability and concurrent validity of U-turn speed, an unsupervised self-assessment of gait and balance impairment, measured using a body-worn smartphone during the 5UTT? Methods: 76 PwMS and 25 healthy controls (HCs) participated in a cross-sectional non-randomised interventional feasibility study. The 5UTT was self-administered daily and the median U-turn speed, measured during a 14-day session, was compared against existing validated in-clinic measures of MS-related disability. Results: U-turn speed, measured during a 14-day session from the 5UTT, demonstrated good-to-excellent test-retest reliability in PwMS alone and combined with HCs (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.87 [95 % CI: 0.80–0.92]) and moderate-to-excellent reliability in HCs alone (ICC = 0.88 [95 % CI: 0.69–0.96]). U-turn speed was significantly correlated with in-clinic measures of walking speed, physical fatigue, ambulation impairment, overall MS-related disability and patients’ self-perception of quality of life, at baseline, Week 12 and Week 24. The minimal detectable change of the U-turn speed from the 5UTT was low (19.42 %) in PwMS and indicates a good precision of this measurement tool when compared with conventional in-clinic measures of walking performance. Significance: The frequent self-assessment of turn speed, as an outcome measure from a smartphone-based U-turn test, may represent an ecologically valid digital solution to remotely and reliably monitor gait and balance impairment in a home environment during MS clinical trials and practice.";"Article";"10.1016/J.GAITPOST.2020.11.025";"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=18792219&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.gaitpost.2020.11.025&atitle=U-turn+speed+is+a+valid+and+reliable+smartphone-based+measure+of+multiple+sclerosis-related+gait+and+balance+impairment&stitle=Gait+Posture&title=Gait+and+Posture&volume=84&issue=&spage=120&epage=126&aulast=Cheng&aufirst=Wei-Yi&auinit=W.-Y.&aufull=Cheng+W.-Y.&coden=GAPOF&isbn=&pages=120-126&date=2021&auinit1=W&auinitm=-Y";"Embase";"Yes";"";"";"yes";"";"";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

This study aimed to verify the existence of possible relationships among PA parameters and the spatio-temporal parameters of gait when both are instrumentally assessed.Thirty-one pwMS (17F, 14 M, mean age 52.5, mean Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score 3.1) were requested to wear a tri-axial accelerometer 24 hours/day for 7 consecutive days and underwent an instrumental gait analysis, performed using an inertial sensor located on the low back, immediately before the PA assessment period. Main spatio-temporal parameters of gait (i.e., gait speed, stride length, cadence and duration of stance, swing, and double support phase) were extracted by processing trunk accelerations. PA was quantified using average number of daily steps and percentage of time spent at different PA intensity, the latter calculated using cut-point sets previously validated for MS. The existence of possible relationships between PA and gait parameters was assessed using Spearman rank correlation coefficient rho.Gait speed and stride length were the parameters with the highest number of significant correlations with PA features. In particular, they were found moderately to largely correlated with number of daily steps (rho 0.62, P< .001), percentage of sedentary activity (rho = -0.44, P < .001) and percentage of moderate-to-vigorous activity (rho = 0.48, P < .001). Small to moderate significant correlations were observed between PA intensity and duration of stance, swing and double support phases.The data obtained suggest that the most relevant determinants associated with higher and more intense levels of PA in free-living conditions are gait speed and stride length. The simultaneous quantitative assessment of gait parameters and PA levels might represent a useful support for physical therapists in tailoring optimized rehabilitative and training interventions.";"Journal Article";"10.1097/MD.0000000000024931";NA;"PubMed";"Yes";"";"";"yes";"";"";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA
