In MS, patients tend to become ill at a younger age and are so variable in terms of their disease course that there is no standard therapy. Therefore, it is necessary to enable a therapy that is as personalized as possible and to respond promptly to any changes, whether with noticeable symptoms or symptomless. Here, measurable parameters of biological processes can be used, which provide good information with regard to prognostic and diagnostic aspects, disease activity and response to therapy, so-called biomarkers Increasing digitalization and the availability of easy-to-use devices and technology also enable healthcare professionals to use a new class of digital biomarkers-digital health technologies-to explain, influence and/or predict health-related outcomes. The technology and devices from which these digital biomarkers stem are quite broad, and range from wearables that collect patients' activity during digitalized functional tests (e.g., the Multiple Sclerosis Performance Test, dual-tasking performance and speech) to digitalized diagnostic procedures (e.g., optical coherence tomography) and software-supported magnetic resonance imaging evaluation. These technologies offer a timesaving way to collect valuable data on a regular basis over a long period of time, not only once or twice a year during patients' routine visit at the clinic. Therefore, they lead to real-life data acquisition, closer patient monitoring and thus a patient dataset useful for precision medicine. Despite the great benefit of such increasing digitalization, for now, the path to implementing digital biomarkers is widely unknown or inconsistent. Challenges around validation, infrastructure, evidence generation, consistent data collection and analysis still persist. In this narrative review, we explore existing and future opportunities to capture clinical digital biomarkers in the care of people with MS, which may lead to a digital twin of the patient. To do this, we searched published papers for existing opportunities to capture clinical digital biomarkers for different functional systems in the context of MS, and also gathered perspectives on digital biomarkers under development or already existing as a research approach.","[Dillenseger, Anja; Weidemann, Marie Luise; Trentzsch, Katrin; Inojosa, Hernan; Haase, Rocco; Schriefer, Dirk; Voigt, Isabel; Scholz, Maria; Akguen, Katja; Ziemssen, Tjalf] Tech Univ Dresden, Univ Clin Carl Gustav Carus, Multiple Sclerosis Ctr Dresden, Ctr Clin Neurosci, Fetscherstr 74, D-01307 Dresden, Germany",Technische Universitat Dresden; Carl Gustav Carus University Hospital,"Ziemssen, T (corresponding author), Tech Univ Dresden, Univ Clin Carl Gustav Carus, Multiple Sclerosis Ctr Dresden, Ctr Clin Neurosci, Fetscherstr 74, D-01307 Dresden, Germany.",Anja.Dillenseger@uniklinikum-dresden.de; MarieLuise.Weidemann@uniklinikum-dresden.de; katrin.trentzsch@uniklinikum-dresden.de; hernan.inojosa@uniklinikum-dresden.de; Rocco.Haase@uniklinikum-dresden.de; dirk.schriefer@uniklinikum-dresden.de; Isabel.Voigt@uniklinikum-dresden.de; maria.scholz@uniklinikum-dresden.de; Katja.Akguen@uniklinikum-dresden.de; Tjalf.Ziemssen@uniklinikum-dresden.de,"Schriefer, Dirk/ABB-9644-2021","Schriefer, Dirk/0000-0002-7524-7628; Ziemssen, Tjalf/0000-0001-8799-8202; Inojosa, Hernan/0000-0002-1377-836X; Voigt, Isabel/0000-0003-0097-8589; Trentzsch, Katrin/0000-0003-2832-4640; Haase, Rocco/0000-0003-2465-4909; Scholz, Maria/0000-0002-3400-5921",Bayer; BAT; Biogen; Novartis; Teva; Sanofi,Bayer(Bayer AG); BAT; Biogen(Biogen); Novartis(Novartis); Teva(Teva Pharmaceutical Industries); Sanofi,".Z. received personal compensation from Biogen, Bayer, Celgene, Novartis,Roche, Sanofi and Teva for consulting services, and additional financial support for research activitiesfrom Bayer, BAT, Biogen, Novartis, Teva and Sanofi.

Detection of progression onset or worsening of symptoms is especially important in people living with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) in order to enable optimally adapted therapeutic strategies. MS symptoms typically follow subtle and fluctuating disease courses, patient-to-patient, and over time. Current in-clinic assessments are often too infrequently administered to reflect longitudinal changes in MS impairment that impact daily life. This work, therefore, explores how smartphones can administer daily two-minute walking assessments to monitor PwMS physical function at home. Methods: Remotely collected smartphone inertial sensor data was transformed through state-of-the-art Deep Convolutional Neural Networks, to estimate a participant's daily ambulatory-related disease severity, longitudinally over a 24-week study. Results: This study demonstrated that smartphone-based ambulatory severity outcomes could accurately estimate MS level of disability, as measured by the EDSS score (r(2): 0.56, p < 0.001). Furthermore, longitudinal severity outcomes were shown to accurately reflect individual participants' level of disability over the study duration. Conclusion: Smartphone-based assessments, that can be performed by patients from their home environments, could greatly augment standard in-clinic outcomes for neurodegenerative diseases. The ability to understand the impact of disease on daily-life between clinical visits, through objective digital outcomes, paves the way forward to better measure and identify signs of disease progression that may be occurring out-of-clinic, to monitor how different patients respond to various treatments, and to ultimately enable the development of better, and more personalised care.","[Creagh, Andrew P.] Univ Oxford, Inst Biomed Engn, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Dondelinger, Frank; Lipsmeier, Florian; Lindemann, Michael] F Hoffmann La Roche Ltd, CH-4070 Basel, Switzerland; [De Vos, Maarten] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Elect Engn, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium",University of Oxford; Roche Holding; KU Leuven,"Creagh, AP (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Inst Biomed Engn, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.",andrew.creagh@eng.ox.ac.uk; frank.dondelinger@roche.com; florian.lipsmeier@roche.com; michael.linde-mann@roche.com; maarten.devos@esat.kuleuven.be,,"Creagh, Andrew/0000-0002-6086-6098",F.

Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine the reliability, construct and concurrent validity of a smartphone-adapted Symbol Digit Modalities Test (sSDMT). Methods: During a 28-day follow-up, 102 patients with MS and 24 healthy controls (HC) used the MS sherpa(R) app to perform the sSDMT every 3 days on their own smartphone. Patients performed the Brief International Cognitive Assessment for MS at baseline. Test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficients, ICC), construct validity (group analyses between cognitively impaired (CI), cognitively preserved (CP) and HC for differences) and concurrent validity (correlation coefficients) were assessed. Results: Patients with MS and HC completed an average of 23.2 (SD = 10.0) and 18.3 (SD = 10.2) sSDMT, respectively. sSDMT demonstrated high test-retest reliability (ICCs > 0.8) with a smallest detectable change of 7 points. sSDMT scores were different between CI patients, CP patients and HC (all ps < 0.05). sSDMT correlated modestly with the clinical SDMT (highest r = 0.690), verbal (highest r = 0.516) and visuospatial memory (highest r = 0.599). Conclusion: Self-administered smartphone-adapted SDMT scores were reliable and different between patients who were CI, CP and HC and demonstrated concurrent validity in assessing information processing speed.","[Lam, K.

Objective To assess reliability of extracted features and meaningfulness of 11 tests applied through a smartphone application (dreaMS). Methods PwMS (age 18-70 and EDSS <= 6.5) and matched healthy volunteers (HV) were asked to perform tests installed on their smartphone once or twice weekly for 5 weeks. Primary outcomes were test-retest reliability of test features (target: intraclass correlation [ICC] >= 0.6 or median coefficient of variation [mCV] < 0.2) and reported meaningfulness of the tests by PwMS. Meaningfulness was self-assessed for each test on a 5-point Likert scale (target: mean score of > 3) and by a structured interview. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04413032. Results We included 31 PwMS (21 [68%] female, mean age 43.4 +/- 12.0 years, median EDSS 3.0 [range 1.0-6.0]) and 31 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers. Out of 133 features extracted from 11 tests, 89 met the preset reliability criteria. All 11 tests were perceived as highly meaningful to PwMS. Conclusion The dreaMS app reliably assessed features reflecting key functional domains meaningful to PwMS. More studies with longer follow-up are needed to prove validity of these measures as digital biomarkers in PwMS.","[Woelfle, Tim; Pless, Silvan; Calabrese, Pasquale; Lorscheider, Johannes; Naegelin, Yvonne] Univ Hosp, Dept Neurol, Basel, Switzerland; [Woelfle, Tim; Pless, Silvan; Calabrese, Pasquale; Lorscheider, Johannes; Naegelin, Yvonne] Univ Hosp, MS Ctr, Basel, Switzerland; [Woelfle, Tim; Pless, Silvan; Calabrese, Pasquale; Gugleta, Konstantin; Lorscheider, Johannes; Naegelin, Yvonne] Univ Basel, Basel, Switzerland; [Woelfle, Tim; Pless, Silvan; Kappos, Ludwig; Lorscheider, Johannes; Naegelin, Yvonne] Res Ctr Clin Neuroimmunol & Neurosci Basel, Basel, Switzerland; [Reyes, Oscar] Healios AG, Basel, Switzerland; [Wiencierz, Andrea] Univ Basel, Univ Hosp, Dept Clin Res, Clin Trial Unit, Basel, Switzerland; [Feinstein, Anthony] Sunnybrook Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Psychiat, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Calabrese, Pasquale] Univ Basel, Div Mol & Cognit Neurosci, Neuropsychol & Behav Neurol Unit, Basel, Switzerland; [Gugleta, Konstantin] Univ Hosp Basel, Ophthalmol, Basel, Switzerland; [Lorscheider, Johannes] Univ Hosp Basel, Dept Neurol, Petersgraben 4, CH-4031 Basel, Switzerland",University of Basel; University of Basel; University of Toronto; Sunnybrook Health Science Center; Sunnybrook Research Institute; University of Basel; University of Basel; University of Basel,"Lorscheider, J (corresponding author), Univ Hosp, Dept Neurol, Basel, Switzerland.;Lorscheider, J (corresponding author), Univ Hosp, MS Ctr, Basel, Switzerland.;Lorscheider, J (corresponding author), Univ Basel, Basel, Switzerland.;Lorscheider, J (corresponding author), Res Ctr Clin Neuroimmunol & Neurosci Basel, Basel, Switzerland.;Lorscheider, J (corresponding author), Univ Hosp Basel, Dept Neurol, Petersgraben 4, CH-4031 Basel, Switzerland.",johannes.lorscheider@usb.ch,"; Reyes Pupo, Oscar Gabriel/K-2511-2017","Kappos, Ludwig/0000-0003-4175-5509; Calabrese, Pasquale/0000-0003-3347-5187; Pless, Silvan/0000-0002-9660-9077; Lorscheider, Johannes/0000-0003-1100-2506; Reyes Pupo, Oscar Gabriel/0000-0003-0169-297X; Naegelin, Yvonne/0000-0002-1315-4100; Woelfle, Tim/0000-0001-6279-4158; Gugleta, Konstantin/0000-0002-3520-2791; Wiencierz, Andrea/0000-0001-8786-7915",University of Basel,University of Basel,Open access funding provided by University of Basel.,,32,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0340-5354,1432-1459,,J NEUROL,J.

Smartphone-based evaluations are becoming popular due to the ubiquitous use of smartphones in society. Objective: To determine the current state of smartphone applications that assess gait and balance among PwMS. Methods: Two independent reviewers screened articles retrieved from PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL, and SportDiscuss. Articles meeting eligibility criteria were summarized and qualitatively discussed. Participant characteristics, validity, reliability, sensitivity and specificity measures, and main results of smartphone-based gait and balance evaluations were summarized. Methodological quality appraisal of the studies was performed using the quality assessment tool for observational cohort and cross-sectional studies. Results: Eight articles were included in this review. The studies present mostly with low risk of bias. All studies successfully tested the use of smartphone applications in assessing gait and balance among PwMS. In total, 75% of the studies evaluated the validity; 38% evaluated the reliability, sensitivity, and specificity of smartphone applications to assess gait and balance. Of those, all studies except one found smartphone applications to be appropriately valid, reliable, sensitive, and specific in assessing gait and balance. Most studies (88%) reported PwMS and clinicians as their intended users. Conclusion: There is evidence supporting the use of smartphone applications to assess gait and balance among PwMS. Future studies should further examine the psychometric properties of smartphone-based gait and postural control assessments as well as the sensitivity and specificity to improve the interpretation of the results.","[Abou, Libak; Wong, Ellyce; Peters, Joseph; Sosnoff, Jacob J.; Rice, Laura A.] Univ Illinois, Coll Appl Hlth Sci, Dept Kinesiol & Community Hlth, 219 Freer Hall,906 S Goodwin Ave, Urbana, IL USA; [Dossou, Mauricette S.] Ctr Natl Hospitalier, Cotonou, Benin; [Dossou, Mauricette S.] Univ Pneumo Phtisiol, Cotonou, Benin; [Sosnoff, Jacob J.; Rice, Laura A.] Univ Illinois, Illinois Multiple Sclerosis Res Collaborat, Urbana, IL USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Rice, LA (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Coll Appl Hlth Sci, Dept Kinesiol & Community Hlth, 219 Freer Hall,906 S Goodwin Ave, Urbana, IL USA.",ricela@illinois.edu,"Abou, Libak/AAH-4763-2020","Abou, Libak/0000-0001-6404-7623; Wong, Ellyce/0000-0001-6173-3513",,,,,49,7,7,2,3,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",2211-0348,2211-0356,,MULT SCLER RELAT DIS,Mult.

The aim of the present study is to quantitatively assess 'real-world' activity time, intensity and possible asymmetry of use among dominant and non-dominant ULs in pwMS. Methods: Twenty-eight pwMS (20 women, 8 men, average EDSS 4.3) and 28 age- and sex-matched unaffected individuals were required to wear a tri-axial accelerometer on each wrist 24h/day for 2 weekdays. Raw accelerations were processed to calculate parameters associated with time and intensity of use of UL both when engaged in uni- or bilateral activities. Results: During the 2-day monitoring period, pwMS were characterized by significantly lower overall activity, they used their dominant limb for a significantly longer time and, while performing bilateral activities, their dominant limb expressed movements of superior intensity in a proportion higher than what was observed in unaffected individuals. Conclusion: The instrumental monitoring of UL activity with two wrist-worn sensors may represent an effective tool for assessing the contribution of each limb to uni- and bilateral movements. Such data can be employed to monitor the progression of UL dysfunctions and the effectiveness of pharmacologic and rehabilitative treatments.","[Pau, Massimiliano; Leban, Bruno; Deidda, Michela; Porta, Micaela] Univ Cagliari, Dept Mech Chem & Mat Engn, Cagliari, Italy; [Deidda, Michela; Porta, Micaela; Coghe, Giancarlo; Cocco, Eleonora] Univ Cagliari, Multiple Sclerosis Ctr, Dept Med Sci & Publ Hlth, Cagliari, Italy; [Cattaneo, Davide] IRCCS Fdn Don Carlo Gnocchi ONLUS, Milan, Italy; [Cattaneo, Davide] Univ Milan, Dept Physiopathol & Transplants, Milan, Italy",University of Cagliari; University of Cagliari; University of Milan,"Pau, M (corresponding author), Univ Cagliari, Dept Mech Chem & Mat Engn, Cagliari, Italy.",massimiliano.pau@dimcm.unica.it,"Pau, Massimiliano/ABG-8404-2021; Cocco, Eleonora/G-5064-2012; Leban, Bruno/B-1595-2013; Pau, Massimiliano/P-7878-2014","Cocco, Eleonora/0000-0002-3878-8820; Leban, Bruno/0000-0003-1846-0630; Porta, Micaela/0000-0003-3835-6507; Pau, Massimiliano/0000-0001-9835-3629",FISM-Fondazione Italiana Sclerosi Mul-tipla (Italian Foundation for Multiple Sclerosis) [2017/R/19],FISM-Fondazione Italiana Sclerosi Mul-tipla (Italian Foundation for Multiple Sclerosis)(Fondazione Italiana Sclerosi Multipla (FISM)),This study was funded by FISM-Fondazione Italiana Sclerosi Mul-tipla (Italian Foundation for Multiple Sclerosis) grant code 2017/R/19.,,33,3,3,0,1,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",2211-0348,2211-0356,,MULT SCLER RELAT DIS,Mult.

MS can, for example, cause pain, changes in mood and fatigue, and may impair a person's movement, speech and visual functions. Diagnosis of MS typically involves a combination of complex clinical assessments and tests to rule out other diseases with similar symptoms. New technologies, such as smartphone monitoring in free-living conditions, could potentially aid in objectively assessing the symptoms of MS by quantifying symptom presence and intensity over long periods of time. Here, we present a deep-learning approach to diagnosing MS from smartphone-derived digital biomarkers that uses a novel combination of a multilayer perceptron with neural soft attention to improve learning of patterns in long-term smartphone monitoring data. Using data from a cohort of 774 participants, we demonstrate that our deep-learning models are able to distinguish between people with and without MS with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.70, 0.88). Our experimental results indicate that digital biomarkers derived from smartphone data could in the future be used as additional diagnostic criteria for MS.","[Schwab, Patrick; Karlen, Walter] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Hlth Sci & Technol, Mobile Hlth Syst Lab, Inst Robot & Intelligent Syst, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Schwab, P (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Hlth Sci & Technol, Mobile Hlth Syst Lab, Inst Robot & Intelligent Syst, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",patrick.schwab@icloud.com; walter.karlen@ieee.org,"Karlen, Walter/C-6290-2008","Karlen, Walter/0000-0001-8643-3074",Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) within NRP 75 Big Data [167302]; NVIDIA Corporation,Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) within NRP 75 Big Data(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); NVIDIA Corporation,This work was supported in part by Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) project No. 167302 within NRP 75 Big Data and in part by NVIDIA Corporation with the donation of the Titan Xp GPUs.,,52,9,9,2,8,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2168-2194,2168-2208,,IEEE J BIOMED HEALTH,IEEE J.

We conducted further analyses to assess MSCopilot's performance with respect to the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Methods: The data of 116 PwMS were analysed. We studied the correlations between MSCopilot scores and the EDSS, and their ability to distinguish PwMS with high and low EDSS through a study of the distribution of the digital test scores as well as logistic regression models. The same analyses were performed using the MSFC tests. Results: MSCopilot composite scores were as highly correlated to the EDSS (vertical bar r vertical bar = 0.65, p < 0.01) as their MSFC counterparts, confirming the known correlation of the MSFC with the EDSS. In a linear regression framework, the Walking digital tests have good explanatory power, especially for PwMS with EDSS > 3.5 (R-adj(2)=0.47). The mean values of each MSCopilot subscore were significantly different between patients with an EDSS > 3.5 and others (p < 0.05), which could not be proved for the MSFC Cognition tests. MSCopilot4 was the best model to predict an EDSS score > 3.5 (AUC = 0.92). Conclusion: These analyses confirm the reliability of MSCopilot and show interesting correlations with the EDSS (similar results obtained with the MSFC). MSCopilot was able to highlight nuances in the different stages of MS the MSFC could not capture.","[Tanoh, Ian-Christopher] Ecole Polytech, Palaiseau, France; [Maillart, Elisabeth; Louapre, Celine] Pitie Salpetriere Hosp Paris, Dept Neurol, Paris, France; [Labauge, Pierre] Montpellier Univ Hosp, Dept Neurol, Montpellier, France; [Cohen, Mikael] Nice Univ Hosp, Dept Neurol, Nice, France; [Maarouf, Adil] Aix Marseille Univ, AP HM, CNRS, CRMBM, Marseille, France; [Maarouf, Adil] Pole Neurosci Clin, Marseille, France; [Vukusic, Sandra] Hosp Civils Lyon, Dept Neurol, Bron, France; [Vukusic, Sandra] Univ Lyon 1, INSERM 1028, Lyon, France; [Vukusic, Sandra] Univ Lyon 1, CNRS UMR 5292, Lyon, France; [Donze, Cecile] Grp Hosp Inst Catholique Lille, Dept Phys & Rehabil Med, Lille, France; [Gallien, Philippe] Pole St Helier, Phys Rehabil Med, Rennes, France; [De Seze, Jerome] Strasbourg Univ, Dept Neurol, Hop Civil, Strasbourg, France; [Bourre, Bertrand] Rouen Univ Hosp, Dept Neurol, Rouen, France; [Moreau, Thibault] Dijon Univ Hosp, Dept Neurol, Dijon, France; [Vallee, Morgane; Bieuvelet, Severine; Klaeyle, Lissandra; Argoud, Anne-Laure; Zinai, Saad] Hop La Pitie Salpetriere, Paris Brain Inst ICM, Ad Scientiam, Paris, France; [Tourbah, Ayman] Univ Paris Saclay, Hop Raymond Poincare, AP HP, UFR Simone Veil,UVSQ,INSERM U 1195,Serv Neurol, Paris, France",Institut Polytechnique de Paris; Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Hopital Universitaire Pitie-Salpetriere - APHP; UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Universite de Montpellier; CHU de Montpellier; CHU Nice; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Aix-Marseille Universite; Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Marseille; CHU Lyon; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Biology (INSB); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Universite Jean Monnet; Universite Catholique de Lille; CHU Strasbourg; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg; CHU de Rouen; Universite de Rouen Normandie; CHU Dijon Bourgogne; Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Hopital Universitaire Pitie-Salpetriere - APHP; UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Hopital Universitaire Raymond-Poincare - APHP; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay,"Tanoh, IC (corresponding author), Ecole Polytech, Palaiseau, France.",ian-christopher.tanoh@polytechnique.org,"Louapre, Céline/AAE-1758-2022",,"Ad Scientiam (Paris, France); Roche SAS France","Ad Scientiam (Paris, France); Roche SAS France","The authors thank the patients and the volunteers, Helene Brissart (Nancy, France) , Claude Mekies (Toulouse, France) , Catherine Vignal-Clermont (Paris, France) for their help in the digital tests' conception; Yann le Coz (Paris, France) for his help in digital tests elaboration; from the Paris Brain Institute, la Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital, Paris, France, Jean-Christophe Corvol for the study organization; Vincent Perlbarg and Francois-Xavier Lejeune for the statistical and analytical plans.

Predicting which patients will fall remains a challenge for clinicians. Standardized functional assessments provide insight into balance deficits and fall risk but their use has been limited to supervised visits. Research question: The study aim was to characterize unsupervised 30-second chair stand test (30CST) performance using accelerometer-derived metrics and assess its ability to classify fall status in PwMS compared to supervised 30CST. Methods: Thirty-seven PwMS (21fallers) performed instrumented supervised and unsupervised 30CSTs with a single wearable sensor on the thigh. In unsupervised conditions, participants performed bi-hourly 30CSTs and rated their balance confidence and fatigue over 48-hours. ROC analysis was used to classify fall status for 30CST performance. Results: Non-fallers (p = 0.02) but not fallers (p = 0.23) differed in their average unsupervised 30CST performance (repetitions) compared to their supervised performance. The unsupervised maximum number of 30CST repetitions performed optimized ROC classification AUC (0.79), accuracy (78.4%) and specificity (90.0%) for fall status with an optimal cutoff of 17 repetitions. Significance: Brief durations of instrumented unsupervised monitoring as an adjunct to routine clinical assessments could improve the ability for predicting fall risk and fluctuations in functional mobility in PwMS.","[Tulipani, Lindsey J.; Meyer, Brett; Allen, Dakota; McGinnis, Ryan S.] Univ Vermont, Dept Elect & Biomed Engn, M Sense Res Grp, Burlington, VT USA; [Solomon, Andrew J.] Univ Vermont, Dept Neurol Sci, Burlington, VT USA; [McGinnis, Ryan S.] Univ Vermont, Dept Elect & Biomed Engn, 33 Colchester Ave, Burlington, VT 05405 USA",University of Vermont; University of Vermont; University of Vermont,"McGinnis, RS (corresponding author), Univ Vermont, Dept Elect & Biomed Engn, 33 Colchester Ave, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.",ryan.mcginnis@uvm.edu,,,NIH [R21EB027852]; UVM College of Engineering and Mathematical Sciences,NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); UVM College of Engineering and Mathematical Sciences,This work was supported in part by NIH Grant R21EB027852.

Utilisation of electronic devices could theoretically improve this. Mobile devices have the potential to continuously monitor health by collecting movement data. Popular fitness trackers record steps taken and distance travelled, typically using a fixed-stride length. However, applications using fixed-stride length may be less accurate in those with altered gait patterns. While useful for everyday purposes, medical monitoring requires greater accuracy. Objective: Our aim was to determine the agreement and reliability of using a smartphone application to measure distance walked. Method: A phone application (mSteps) was developed and tested in a pilot study and then a validation study, looking at an indoor and outdoor setting with people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) and a control cohort. Results: In the pilot study, the 95% limits of agreement (LOA) for outdoor tracking in control cohort lay within the a priori defined limit; however, the indoor tracking in both cohorts did not meet the defined limit. The app was then successfully validated outdoors in PwMS. Conclusion: mSteps could be used to accurately measure distance outdoors in PwMS.

Yet fall prevention interventions are not often prescribed until after a fall has been reported to a healthcare provider. While still nascent, objective fall risk assessments could help in prescribing preventative interventions. To this end, retrospective fall status classification commonly serves as an intermediate step in developing prospective fall risk assessments. Previous research has identified measures of gait biomechanics that differ between PwMS who have fallen and those who have not, but these biomechanical indices have not yet been leveraged to detect PwMS who have fallen. Moreover, they require the use of laboratory-based measurement technologies, which prevent clinical deployment. Here we demonstrate that a bidirectional long short-term (BiLSTM) memory deep neural network was able to identify PwMS who have recently fallen with good performance (AUC of 0.88) based on accelerometer data recorded from two wearable sensors during a one-minute walking task. These results provide substantial improvements over machine learning models trained on spatiotemporal gait parameters (21% improvement in AUC), statistical features from the wearable sensor data (16%), and patient-reported (19%) and neurologist-administered (24%) measures in this sample. The success and simplicity (two wearable sensors, only one-minute of walking) of this approach indicates the promise of inexpensive wearable sensors for capturing fall risk in PwMS.","[Meyer, Brett M.; Tulipani, Lindsey J.; Gurchiek, Reed D.; Allen, Dakota A.; Adamowicz, Lukas; Larie, Dale; Solomon, Andrew J.; Cheney, Nick; McGinnis, Ryan S.] Univ Vermont, Burlington, VT 05405 USA",University of Vermont,"McGinnis, RS (corresponding author), Univ Vermont, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.",brett.meyer@uvm.edu; ltulipani@uvm.edu; reed.gurchiek@uvm.edu; dallen@uvm.edu; lukas.adomowicz@uvm.edu; dale.larie@uvm.edu; andrew.solomon@uvmhealth.org; ncheney@uvm.edu; ryan.mcginnis@uvm.edu,"Meyer, Brett/AAZ-8398-2021","Gurchiek, Reed/0000-0002-7040-2238; Adamowicz, Lukas/0000-0001-6992-9545; McGinnis, Ryan/0000-0001-8396-6967",NIH [R21EB027852],NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA),This work was supported in part by NIH under Grant R21EB027852.,,65,20,20,5,14,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2168-2194,2168-2208,,IEEE J BIOMED HEALTH,IEEE J.

Design: Single cross-sectional study Setting: Multiple sclerosis rehabilitation centre in Colchester, United Kingdom. Subjects: Twenty-one adults (59 +/- 9 years) with multiple sclerosis. Main measures: Physical activity behaviours (activity level: activity counts per minute; activity variability: highest activity counts per minute each day divided by activity counts per minute on that day) were measured with accelerometers. Self-reported activity pacing (Activity Pacing and Risk of Overactivity Questionnaire), fatigue severity (Fatigue Severity Scale) and health-related quality of life (RAND-12-Item Short-Form Health Survey) were measured. Scatter plots were used to explore associations between measures. Results: Activity level was 258 +/- 133 counts per minutes, activity variability was 4 +/- 1, self-reported activity pacing was 3 +/- 1, fatigue severity was 5 +/- 2 and health-related quality of life was 43 +/- 8. Increased self-reported activity pacing was associated with lower activity levels and less variability in daily activities. Conclusion: This investigation suggests that people with multiple sclerosis who have low physical activity levels could be inappropriately using activity pacing as a reactionary response to their multiple sclerosis symptoms.","[Abonie, Ulric S.] Univ Hlth & Allied Sci, Dept Physiotherapy & Rehabil Sci, Volta Region, Ghana; [Abonie, Ulric S.; Hettinga, Florentina J.] Univ Essex, Sch Sport, Rehabil & Exercise Sci, Colchester, Essex, England; [Saxton, John; Baker, Katherine; Hettinga, Florentina J.] Northumbria Univ, Dept Sport, Exercise & Rehabil, Northumberland Bldg,Coll Lane, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8SG, Tyne & Wear, England",University of Essex; Northumbria University,"Hettinga, FJ (corresponding author), Northumbria Univ, Dept Sport, Exercise & Rehabil, Northumberland Bldg,Coll Lane, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8SG, Tyne & Wear, England.",florentina.hettinga@northumbria.ac.uk,,"Abonie, Ulric/0000-0003-2509-4413; Hettinga, Florentina/0000-0002-7027-8126; Baker, Katherine/0000-0003-4216-6298",local Colchester Multiple Sclerosis Society,local Colchester Multiple Sclerosis Society,"The authors would like to thank all participants for their contribution to the study.

Evidence in the literature is currently scarce. MS sherpa is an eHealth intervention with digital biomarkers, aimed at monitoring symptom progression and disease activity. To show the added value of digital biomarker-based eHealth interventions to the MS care path, an early Health Technology Assessment (eHTA) was performed, with MS sherpa as an example, to assess the potential impact on treatment switches. (2) Methods: The eHTA was performed according to the Dutch guidelines for health economic evaluations. A decision analytic MS model was used to estimate the costs and benefits of MS standard care with and without use of MS sherpa, expressed in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) from both societal and health care perspectives. The efficacy of MS sherpa on early detection of active disease and the initiation of a treatment switch were modeled for a range of assumed efficacy (5%, 10%, 15%, 20%). (3) Results: From a societal perspective, for the efficacy of 15% or 20%, MS sherpa became dominant, which means cost-saving compared to the standard of care. MS sherpa is cost-effective in the 5% and 10% scenarios (ICERs EUR 14,535 and EUR 4069, respectively). From the health care perspective, all scenarios were cost-effective. Sensitivity analysis showed that increasing the efficacy of MS sherpa in detecting active disease early leading to treatment switches be the most impactful factor in the MS model. (4) Conclusions: The results indicate the potential of eHealth interventions to be cost-effective or even cost-saving in the MS care path. As such, digital biomarker-based eHealth interventions, like MS sherpa, are promising cost-effective solutions in optimizing MS disease management for people with MS, by detecting active disease early and helping neurologists in decisions on treatment switch.","[Cloosterman, Sonja; Wijnands, Inez; den Teuling, Bram] Orikami Digital Hlth Prod, Ridderstr 29, NL-6511 TM Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Huygens, Simone; Wester, Valerie; Versteegh, Matthijs] Erasmus Univ, Inst Med Technol Assessment iMTA, Burgemeester Oudlaan 50, NL-3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Wester, Valerie] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Hlth Policy & Management, Burgemeester Oudlaan 50, NL-3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Lam, Ka-Hoo; Strijbis, Eva] Amsterdam Univ Med Ctr, MS Ctr Amsterdam, Dept Neurol, Locat VUmc, De Boelelaan, NL-1117 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Cloosterman, S (corresponding author), Orikami Digital Hlth Prod, Ridderstr 29, NL-6511 TM Nijmegen, Netherlands.",sonja@orikami.nl; inez@orikami.nl; huygens@imta.eur.nl; wester@eshpm.eur.nl; k.lam1@amsterdamumc.nl; e.striibis@amsterdamumc.nl; bram@orikami.nl; versteegh@imta.eur.nl,"Strijbis, Eva M.M./AAH-7822-2021","Strijbis, Eva M.M./0000-0001-6705-5864; van Hezik-Wester, Valerie/0000-0002-2691-7162; Lam, Ka-Hoo/0000-0003-0926-1445; Versteegh, Matthijs/0000-0003-4804-235X","Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport; Erasmus Medical Center","Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport; Erasmus Medical Center","iMTA received project funding from the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport for performing this eHTA for an eHealth/AI application.

As part of the RADAR-CNS consortium, we have conducted research into the application of wearables and smartphone apps in the care of people with multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, or depression. Methods We conducted a large online survey study to explore the experiences of HCPs working with patients who have one or more of these conditions. The survey covered smartphone apps and wearables used by clinicians and their patients, and how data from these technologies impacted on the respondents' clinical practice. The survey was conducted between February 2019 and March 2020 via a web-based platform. Detailed statistical analysis was performed on the answers. Results Of 1009 survey responses from HCPs, 1006 were included in the analysis after data cleaning. Smartphone apps are used by more than half of responding HCPs and more than three quarters of their patients use smartphone apps or wearable devices for health-related purposes. HCPs widely believe the data that patients collect using these devices impacts their clinical practice. Subgroup analyses show that views on the impact of this data on different aspects of clinical work varies according to whether respondents use apps themselves, and, to a lesser extent, according to their clinical setting and job role. Conclusions Use of smartphone apps is widespread among HCPs participating in this large European survey and caring for people with epilepsy, multiple sclerosis and depression. The majority of respondents indicate that they treat patients who use wearables and other devices for health-related purposes and that data from these devices has an impact on clinical practice.","[Andrews, J.

Methods Preplanned interim analysis of a cohort study with 102 MS patients assessed at baseline and 3-month follow-up for gadolinium-enhancing lesions on magnetic resonance imaging, relapses, fatigue and clinical disability outcomes. Keyboard interactions were unobtrusively collected during typing using the Neurokeys App. From these interactions 15 keystroke features were derived and aggregated using 16 summary and time series statistics. Responsiveness of KD to clinical anchor-based change was assessed by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The optimal cut-point was used to determine the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) and compared to the smallest real change (SRC). Commonly used clinical measures were analyzed for comparison. Results A total of 94 patients completed the follow-up. The five best performing keystroke features had AUC-values in the range 0.72-0.78 for change in gadolinium-enhancing lesions, 0.67-0.70 for the Checklist Individual Strength Fatigue subscale, 0.66-0.79 for the Expanded Disability Status Scale, 0.69-0.73 for the Ambulation Functional System, and 0.72-0.75 for Arm function in MS Questionnaire. The MCID of these features exceeded the SRC on group level. KD had higher AUC-values than comparative clinical measures for the study outcomes, aside from ambulatory function. Conclusions Keystroke dynamics demonstrated good responsiveness to changes in disease activity, fatigue, and clinical disability in MS, and detected important change beyond measurement error on group level. Responsiveness of KD was better than commonly used clinical measures.","[Lam, Ka-Hoo; de Ruiter, Lodewijk; van Lierop, Zoe; Uitdehaag, Bernard; Killestein, Joep] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Univ Med Ctr, Amsterdam Neurosci, Dept Neurol,MS Ctr Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1117, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Twose, James; McConchie, Hannah; Licitra, Giovanni; Meijer, Kim] Neurocast BV, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Moraal, Bastiaan; Barkhof, Frederik] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Univ Med Ctr, MS Ctr Amsterdam, Dept Radiol & Nucl Med,Amsterdam Neurosci, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Barkhof, Frederik] UCL, Queen Sq Inst Neurol, London, England; [Barkhof, Frederik] UCL, Ctr Med Image Comp, London, England; [de Groot, Vincent] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Univ Med Ctr, Amsterdam Neurosci, Dept Rehabil Med,MS Ctr Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; University of London; University College London; University of London; University College London; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Lam, KH (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Univ Med Ctr, Amsterdam Neurosci, Dept Neurol,MS Ctr Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1117, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",k.lam1@amsterdamumc.nl,,"Barkhof, Frederik/0000-0003-3543-3706; Killestein, Joep/0000-0002-6347-5957; Uitdehaag, Bernard/0000-0002-9226-7364; McConchie, Hannah/0000-0002-6422-4447",Top Sector Life Sciences Health [LSHM16060-SGF]; Stichting MS Research [16-946 MS]; Healthsimilar toHolland; PPP Allowance; Biogen,Top Sector Life Sciences Health; Stichting MS Research; Healthsimilar toHolland; PPP Allowance; Biogen(Biogen),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: the collaboration project is co--funded by the PPP Allowance made available by Health similar to Holland, Top Sector Life Sciences & Health [grant number LSHM16060--SGF], and Stichting MS Research [grant number 16--946 MS] to stimulate public-private partnerships as well as by a contribution from Biogen (unrestricted funding)",,39,0,0,0,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1351-5101,1468-1331,,EUR J NEUROL,Eur.

Thus, there is an unmet medical need to develop objective and reliable methods to evaluate fatigue. Our study seeks to develop an objective and ubiquitous monitoring tool for assessing fatigue. Leveraging a smartphone-based rapid tapping task, we conducted a two-week in-the-wild study with 35 MS patients. We explore the association between tapping derived metrics and perceived fatigue assessed with two standard clinical scales: fatigue severity scale (FSS) and fatigue scale for motor and cognitive function (FSMC). Our novel smartphone-based fatigue metric, mean tapping frequency, objectively ranks perceived fatigue with a mean AUC(ROC)=.76, CI = [.71,.81] according to the FSMC, and a mean AUC(ROC) =.81, CI = [.76,.86] according to the FSS.

During the last few years, many studies have been carried out to assess spasticity using wearable IMU (inertial measurements unit) sensors. This review aims to provide an updated framework of the current research on IMUs wearable sensors in people living with spasticity in recent studies published between 2017 and 2021. A total of 322 articles were screened, then finally 10 articles were selected. Results show the lack of homogenization of study procedures and missing apparatus information in some studies. Still, most studies performed adequately on measures of reporting and found that IMUs wearable data was successful in their respective purposes and goals. As IMUs estimate translational and rotational body motions, we believe there is a strong potential for these applications to estimate velocity-dependent exaggeration of stretch reflexes and spasticity-related characteristics in spasticity. This review also proposes new directions of research that should be challenged by larger study groups and could be of interest to both researchers as well as clinicians. The use of IMUs to evaluate spasticity is a promising avenue to provide an objective measurement as compared to non-instrumented traditional assessments.","[Weizman, Yehuda; Tirosh, Oren; Tan, Adin Ming] Swinburne Univ Technol, Sch Hlth Sci, Dept Hlth & Med Sci, Hawthorn Campus, Melbourne, Vic 3122, Australia; [Fuss, Franz Konstantin] Univ Bayreuth, Chair Biomech, Fac Engn Sci, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany; [Rutz, Erich] Royal Childrens Hosp, Dept Orthopaed, Melbourne, Vic 3052, Australia; [Rutz, Erich] Murdoch Childrens Res Inst, Melbourne, Vic 3052, Australia; [Rutz, Erich] Univ Melbourne, Dept Paediat, Melbourne, Vic 3052, Australia; [Rutz, Erich] Univ Basel, Fac Med, CH-4001 Basel, Switzerland",Swinburne University of Technology; University of Bayreuth; Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne; Murdoch Children's Research Institute; University of Melbourne; University of Basel; University of Geneva,"Weizman, Y (corresponding author), Swinburne Univ Technol, Sch Hlth Sci, Dept Hlth & Med Sci, Hawthorn Campus, Melbourne, Vic 3122, Australia.",uweizman@swin.edu.au; otirosh@swin.edu.au; franzkonstantin.fuss@uni-bayreuth.de; amtan@swin.edu.au; erich_rutz@hotmail.com,,"Rutz, Erich/0000-0002-2292-0946; Tirosh, Oren/0000-0002-2281-6399","Bob Dickens Research Fellowship in Paediatric Orthopaedics, University of Melbourne","Bob Dickens Research Fellowship in Paediatric Orthopaedics, University of Melbourne","The authors received no specific funding for this work.

In the HC group, 21 participants were matched to the persons with MS based on age, gender, and education and these followed the same assessment schedule as the persons with MS (the HC-matched group), whereas 58 participants had a less intense assessment schedule to determine reference values (the HC-normative group). Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were determined between the distance measured by the s2MWT and the distance measured using distance markers on the pavement during these s2MWT assessments. ICCs were also determined for test-retest reliability and derived from 10 smartphone tests per study participant, with 3 days in between each test. We interviewed 7 study participants with MS regarding their experiences with the s2MWT. Results: In total, 755 s2MWTs were completed. The adherence rate for the persons with MS and the participants in the HC-matched group was 92.4% (425/460). The calculated distance walked on the s2MWT was, on average, 8.43 m or 5% (SD 18.9 m or 11%) higher than the distance measured using distance markers (n=43). An ICC of 0.817 was found for the concurrent validity of the s2MWT in the combined analysis of persons with MS and HC participants. Average ICCs of 9 test-retest reliability analyses of the s2MWT for persons with MS and the participants in the HC-matched group were 0.648 (SD 0.150) and 0.600 (SD 0.090), respectively, whereas the average ICC of 2 test-retest reliability analyses of the s2MWT for the participants in the HC-normative group was 0.700 (SD 0.029). The interviewed study participants found the s2MWT easy to perform, but they also expressed that the test results can be confronting and that a pressure to reach a certain distance can be experienced. Conclusions: The high correlation between s2MWT distance and the conventional 2MWT distance indicates a good concurrent validity. Similarly, high correlations underpin a good test-retest reliability of the s2MWT. We conclude that the s2MWT can be used to measure the distance that the persons with MS walk in 2 minutes outdoors near their home, from which both clinical studies and clinical practice can benefit.","[van Oirschot, Pim; den Teuling, Bram; Dorssers, Frank; van Ee, Rene] Orikami Digital Hlth Prod, Ridderstr 29, NL-6511 TM Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Heerings, Marco] Dutch Natl Multiple Sclerosis Fdn, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Heerings, Marco] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Med Ctr, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Wendrich, Karine] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Fac Sci, Inst Sci Soc, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [van Ee, Rene] Sint Maartenskliniek, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Martens, Marijn Bart] Drug Target ID, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Martens, Marijn Bart] NeuroDrug Res BV, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Jongen, Peter Joseph] Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Community & Occupat Med, Groningen, Netherlands; [Jongen, Peter Joseph] MS4 Res Inst, Nijmegen, Netherlands",Radboud University Nijmegen; Radboud University Nijmegen; Sint Maartens Clinic; University of Groningen,"van Oirschot, P (corresponding author), Orikami Digital Hlth Prod, Ridderstr 29, NL-6511 TM Nijmegen, Netherlands.",pim@mssherpa.nl,,"den Teuling, Bram/0000-0001-9084-5645; van Oirschot, Pim/0000-0003-1135-0500; van Ee, Rene/0000-0002-6843-0133; Wendrich, Karine/0000-0001-9413-1674; Jongen, Peter Joseph/0000-0002-9202-6309; Heerings, Marco/0000-0002-9914-042X","European Regional Development Fund (EFRO OP Oost Project) [00217]; Dutch National Multiple Sclerosis Foundation, Rotterdam, the Netherlands","European Regional Development Fund (EFRO OP Oost Project); Dutch National Multiple Sclerosis Foundation, Rotterdam, the Netherlands","The study received financial support from the European Regional Development Fund (EFRO OP Oost Project 00217) and the Dutch National Multiple Sclerosis Foundation, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.",,47,0,0,0,0,"JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC",TORONTO,"130 QUEENS QUAY East, Unit 1100, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA",,2561-326X,,JMIR FORM RES,JMIR Form.

This study aimed to evaluate whether a protocol to determine individualized MVPA cutoff from accelerometer is feasible in terms of difficulty perception, physical exertion and evaluation time in persons with MS. METHODS: Two accelerometers, were calibrated against an oxygen consumption system, during the simulation of 4 different daily tasks. The feasibility was assessed in terms of participants' overall difficulty, physical exertion and task durations. RESULTS: For persons with MS (N.=28), median overall difficulty evaluated with a visual analog scale (0-10) ranged from 3 for the ironing to 6.5 for the stair task. The median physical exertion assessed with the Borg Test ranged from 9 (very light) for the ironing, to 13 (somewhat hard) for the stairs task. The mean overall time to realize the evaluation was 41 minutes. MVPA cutoffs were different between participants, tasks and accelerometer position. CONCLUSIONS: Every participant included in this study realized the entire protocol without particular difficulty. The entire protocol was realized in less than 41 minutes, with an overall and physical exertion results not higher than those observed in walking tests currently practiced in persons with MS. MVPA cutoffs varied in function of individuals, daily life activities and accelerometer positions; these variations are in favor of a previous individualized calibration to enhance accuracy of MVPA daily life measurements in persons with MS.","[Leblanc, Rozenn; Decavel, Pierre; Sagawa, Yoshimasa] Univ Hosp Besancon, Clin Funct Explorat Lab Movement, Besancon, France; [Leblanc, Rozenn; Decavel, Pierre; Sagawa, Yoshimasa] Univ Hosp Besancon, Dept Phys Med & Rehabil, F-25030 Besancon, France; [Decavel, Pierre; Moulin, Thierry; Sagawa, Yoshimasa] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, Integrat & Clin Neurosci EA481, Besancon, France; [Cassirame, Johan] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, Dept Culture Sport Hlth & Soc, EA 4660, Besancon, France; [Cassirame, Johan] Lab Performance Sante Metrol Soc, EA 7507, Reims, France; [Tordi, Nicolas] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, PEPITE, EA4267, FHU INCREASE,EPSI, Besancon, France; [Moulin, Thierry] Univ Hosp Besancon, Dept Neurol, Besancon, France",Universite de Franche-Comte; CHU Besancon; Universite de Franche-Comte; CHU Besancon; Universite de Franche-Comte; Universite de Franche-Comte; Universite de Franche-Comte; CHU Besancon,"Sagawa, Y (corresponding author), Univ Hosp Besancon, Dept Phys Med & Rehabil, F-25030 Besancon, France.",sagawajunior@gmail.com,,,,,,,38,0,0,0,0,EDIZIONI MINERVA MEDICA,TURIN,"CORSO BRAMANTE 83-85 INT JOURNALS DEPT., 10126 TURIN, ITALY",0393-3660,1827-1812,,GAZZ MED ITAL ARCH S,Gazz.

The aim of this study was to comprehensively phenotype sleep patterns in PwMS through application of an emerging seven-domain framework that includes sleep duration, continuity, timing, quality, rhythmicity, regularity, and sleepiness. Methods: Sleep domains were estimated from wrist-worn accelerometry, Epworth Sleepiness Scale and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index responses. Extreme sleep values within each domain were constructed using previously published guidelines. A composite score of extreme values was calculated for each participant. Associations between sleep domains and severity of MS symptoms were explored (pain, fatigue, depressive symptoms, and cognitive dysfunction). Results: Among n = 49 participants, median total sleep time was 456.3 min. Median time spent awake after sleep onset was 37 min. Sleepiness, abnormal sleep timing, and poor sleep quality affected 33%, 35%, and 45% of participants, respectively. Seventy-six percent had >= 2 sleep domains in extreme ranges. PwMS had longer sleep duration and decreased sleep regularity compared to a non-MS historical cohort of older men. Greater daytime sleepiness, poorer sleep quality, and higher composite sleep health score were associated with more depressive symptoms, and lower sleep rhythmicity was associated with higher fatigue. Associations were observed between measures of cognitive function and sleep fragmentation, duration, quality, rhythmicity, and composite score. Conclusion: Application of a seven-domain sleep health framework that captures the dynamic and multifaceted aspects of sleep is feasible in PwMS, and offers potential for an improved understanding of the scope and impact of sleep disturbances in PwMS.","[Whibley, Daniel] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Med Med Sci & Nutr, Epidemiol Grp, Aberdeen, Scotland; [Whibley, Daniel; Kratz, Anna L.] Univ Michigan, Dept Phys Med & Rehabil, Ann Arbor, MI USA; [Kratz, Anna L.] Univ Michigan, Div Sleep Med, Dept Neurol, Ann Arbor, MI USA; [Braley, Tiffany J.] Univ Michigan, Div Multiple Sclerosis & Neuroimmunol, Dept Neurol, C728 Med Inn Bldg,1500 Med Ctr Dr, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Braley, Tiffany J.] Dept Neurol, Ann Arbor, VA USA",University of Aberdeen; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Braley, TJ (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Div Multiple Sclerosis & Neuroimmunol, Dept Neurol, C728 Med Inn Bldg,1500 Med Ctr Dr, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",tbraley@med.umich.edu,"Whibley, Daniel/ACH-8752-2022; Whibley, Daniel/F-9812-2016","Whibley, Daniel/0000-0002-7131-7158",National Institutes of Health (NIH) [UL1TR002240]; National Multiple Sclerosis Society [RG 5280-A-2],National Institutes of Health (NIH)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); National Multiple Sclerosis Society(National Multiple Sclerosis Society),This study was partially funded by a National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant administered through the Michigan Institute for Clinical & Health Research Pilot Grant Program at the University of Michigan (NIH grant number: UL1TR002240) .

This could improve disease characterization and monitoring, and could potentially support treatment decisions for multiple sclerosis (MS), a multifaceted chronic neurological disease with highly variable clinical manifestations. Practice effects can complicate the interpretation of both improvement over time by potentially exaggerating treatment effects and stability by masking deterioration. Objective: The aim of this study is to identify short-term learning and long-term practice effects in 6 active tests for cognition, dexterity, and mobility in user-scheduled, high-frequency smartphone-based testing. Methods: We analyzed data from 264 people with self-declared MS with a minimum of 5 weeks of follow-up and at least 5 repetitions per test in the Floodlight Open study, a self-enrollment study accessible by smartphone owners from 16 countries. The collected data are openly available to scientists. Using regression and bounded growth mixed models, we characterized practice effects for the following tests: electronic Symbol Digit Modalities Test (e-SDMT) for cognition; Finger Pinching and Draw a Shape for dexterity; and Two Minute Walk, U-Turn, and Static Balance for mobility. Results: Strong practice effects were found for e-SDMT (n=4824 trials), Finger Pinching (n=19,650), and Draw a Shape (n=19,019) with modeled boundary improvements of 40.8% (39.9%-41.6%), 86.2% (83.6%-88.7%), and 23.1% (20.9%-25.2%) over baseline, respectively. Half of the practice effect was reached after 11 repetitions for e-SDMT, 28 repetitions for Finger Pinching, and 17 repetitions for Draw a Shape; 90% was reached after 35, 94, and 56 repetitions, respectively. Although baseline performance levels were highly variable across participants, no significant differences between the short-term learning effects in low performers (5th and 25th percentile), median performers, and high performers (75th and 95th percentile) were found for e-SDMT up to the fifth trial (beta=1.50-2.00). Only small differences were observed for Finger Pinching (beta=1.25-2.5). For U-Turn (n=15,051) and Static Balance (n=16,797), only short-term learning effects could be observed, which ceased after a maximum of 5 trials. For Two Minute Walk (n=14,393), neither short-term learning nor long-term practice effects were observed. Conclusions: Smartphone-based tests are promising for monitoring the disease trajectories of MS and other chronic neurological diseases. Our findings suggest that strong long-term practice effects in cognitive and dexterity functions have to be accounted for to identify disease-related changes in these domains, especially in the context of personalized health and in studies without a comparator arm. In contrast, changes in mobility may be more easily interpreted because of the absence of long-term practice effects, even though short-term learning effects might have to be considered.","[Woelfle, Tim; Pless, Silvan; Kappos, Ludwig; Naegelin, Yvonne; Lorscheider, Johannes] Univ Basel, Univ Hosp Basel, Res Ctr Clin Neuroimmunol & Neurosci Basel, Spitalstr 2, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland; [Woelfle, Tim; Pless, Silvan; Kappos, Ludwig; Naegelin, Yvonne; Lorscheider, Johannes] Univ Hosp Basel, Dept Neurol, Basel, Switzerland; [Wiencierz, Andrea] Univ Basel, Univ Hosp Basel, Dept Clin Res, Clin Trial Unit, Basel, Switzerland",University of Basel; University of Basel; University of Basel,"Lorscheider, J (corresponding author), Univ Basel, Univ Hosp Basel, Res Ctr Clin Neuroimmunol & Neurosci Basel, Spitalstr 2, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland.",johannes.lorscheider@usb.ch,,"Wiencierz, Andrea/0000-0001-8786-7915; Pless, Silvan/0000-0002-9660-9077; Naegelin, Yvonne/0000-0002-1315-4100; Woelfle, Tim/0000-0001-6279-4158; Kappos, Ludwig/0000-0003-4175-5509",,,,,39,3,3,2,3,"JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC",TORONTO,"130 QUEENS QUAY E, STE 1102, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA",1438-8871,,,J MED INTERNET RES,J.

Purpose We examined differences in VO2peak and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity between older adults with multiple sclerosis and healthy controls, and whether moderate-to-vigorous physical activity accounted for group differences in VO2peak. Methods Older adults with multiple sclerosis (n = 31) and healthy controls (n = 29) completed a cardiopulmonary exercise test and wore an accelerometer for measuring moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. The data were analyzed using the Baron and Kenny approach for examining moderate-to-vigorous physical activity as a mediator of group differences in VO2peak. Results The multiple sclerosis group had significantly lower VO2peak and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity than healthy controls. VO2peak had a large correlation with moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (r = .59). Group initially explained 8% of the variance in VO2peak (beta = -0.29). The inclusion of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity accounted for an additional 27% of the variance in VO2peak, but only moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (beta = 0.57) was a statistically significant correlate of VO2peak. The effect of Group was attenuated and non-significant with the addition of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity in Step 2 (Group beta Step 1 = -0.29, Group beta Step 2 = -0.05).

PA participation is associated with lower disease activity, depression and fatigue as well as higher self-efficacy, goal setting and decreased barriers. These latter constructs may be targeted by an intervention program for behavior change, and such intervention must account for disease rarity, geographical proximity and time constraints which limit the feasibility, accessibility, and sustainability of implementing a PA intervention in youth with MS. We have developed a theory-informed mobile-app based PA promotion program to address these barriers, Active Teens with Multiple Sclerosis (ATOMIC) and herein report the feasibility of delivering this intervention in youth with MS. Objective: To determine the feasibility of delivering the ATOMIC program to youth with MS. Methods: Fifteen youth with MS (13F, 16.6 +/- 1.2 years) followed at the Hospital for Sick Children were enrolled in the ATOMIC intervention. Participants underwent a standard clinical evaluation; an exercise test to determine cardiorespiratory fitness; 7-day PA monitoring with an accelerometer; and completed standardized depression, fatigue questionnaires at baseline and post-intervention. Social cognitive scales related to self-efficacy, self management, goal setting, perceived barriers, outcome expectancy, and social support were completed at baseline, six and 12-weeks. The 12-week mobile app PA intervention was informed by Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) and included: individualized PA coaching, PA self-monitoring (Fitbit), goal setting, social support and MS specific educational modules. Feasibility was defined as (1) meeting the recruitment target of 15 participants within a one-year period; (2) completion of > 80% of study related questionnaires and testing; (3) a drop-out rate of less than 20%, and (4) adherence to the ATOMIC intervention program components of > 80% (Fitbit wear, PA coaching calls, modules). Results: From March 2018 to April 2019, 53% of youth approached agreed to participate (15/28). 13/15 participants completed the intervention. 36 of the possible 39 coaching calls (92%: 3 possible phone calls per participant); 89% wear adherence to FitbitCharge2 data (mean = 75 +/- 16.6 days of 84 days); and 5/12 (42%) of modules were completed. An average 8.4% (SD= 40%, range =-74.0 to 176%) increase in Fitbit steps above the first week of the intervention were observed. PA level from accelerometry at 12-weeks, aerobic fitness, depression and fatigue were unchanged. SCT scales indicated an increase in social support from friends (0.67 points, T = 2.7, pholm=0.04), and a decrease in outcome expectancy (-2.7, T = 3.0, pholm=0.03). There were no differences in self-efficacy, self-management or perceived barriers post intervention. Conclusions: Our results indicate that the ATOMIC program is feasible for delivery in youth with MS. Future work is needed to understand how to best implement each element of SCT through added features in the mobile-app, and to evaluate how the individual components of SCT mediate change in PA behaviours of youth with MS.","[Stephens, S.; Berenbaum, Tara; Yeh, E.

However, it is important to understand users' perspectives. The aim of this study was to explore the patients' and physiotherapists' satisfaction from gait training with the EKSO GT(R) exoskeleton in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). A cross-sectional study with 54 participants was conducted. Clinical data and self-administered scales data were registered from all patients who performed sessions with EKSO GT(R). To evaluate patients' satisfaction the Quebec User Evaluation with Assistive Technology and Client Satisfaction Questionnaire were used. A high level of satisfaction was reported for patients and for physiotherapists. A moderate correlation was found between the number of sessions and the patients' satisfaction score (rho = 0.532; p < 0.001), and an excellent correlation between the physiotherapists' time of experience in neurology rehabilitation and the satisfaction with the possibility of combining the device with other gait trainings approaches (rho = 0.723; p = 0.003).

The MS tremor is complex because it contains an ataxic intentional tremor component due to the involvement of the cerebellum and cerebellar outflow pathways by MS plaques, which makes the MS tremor, in general, less responsive to medications or deep brain stimulation (DBS) than those associated with essential tremor or Parkinson's disease. The cerebellar component has been thought to be the main reason for making DBS less effective, although it is not clear whether it is due to the lack of suppression of the ataxic tremor by DBS or else. The goal of this study was to clarify the effect of DBS on cerebellar tremor compared to non-cerebellar tremor in a patient with MS. By wearing an accelerometer on the index finger of each hand, we were able to quantitatively characterize kinetic tremor by frequency and amplitude, with cerebellar ataxia component on one hand and that without cerebellar component on the other hand, at the beginning and end of the hand movement approaching a target at DBS Off and On status. We found that cerebellar tremor surprisingly had as good a response to DBS as the tremor without a cerebellar component, but the function control on cerebellar tremor was not as good due to its distal oscillation, which made the amplitude of tremor increasingly greater as it approached the target. This explains why cerebellar tremor or MS tremor with cerebellar component has a poor functional transformation even with a good percentage of tremor control. This case study provides a better understanding of the effect of DBS on cerebellar tremor and MS tremor by using a wearable device, which could help future studies improve patient selection and outcome prediction for DBS treatment of this disabling tremor.","[Xie, Tao; Padmanaban, Mahesh; Javed, Adil; Towle, Vernon L.] Univ Chicago Med, Dept Neurol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Satzer, David; Towle, Theresa E.; Warnke, Peter] Univ Chicago Med, Dept Neurosurg, Chicago, IL USA",,"Xie, T (corresponding author), Univ Chicago Med, Dept Neurol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",txie@neurology.bsd.uchicago.edu,,"Satzer, David/0000-0001-8573-1555",,,,,9,0,0,0,1,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1662-5161,,,FRONT HUM NEUROSCI,Front.

Forty-one PwMS and 16 healthy persons participated in this study. Their physical activity in real-life conditions was assessed with an accelerometer. For the clinical evaluations, the quality of life, fatigue, gait, and balance were assessed. The level of activity between PwMS for weekdays, weekends, Saturdays, and Sundays was significantly reduced compared with the reference group (p = 0.001-0.00001, d = 0.95-1.76). PwMS had a constant level of activity throughout the week, whereas the reference group increased its level of activity on Saturdays (p = 0.04, d = 0.69). The level of activity was correlated in descending order with multiple sclerosis disability, body mass index, gait velocity, six-minute walk test, and timed up and go test.

The aims of the study were to objectively quantify PA levels in non-disabled PwMS, to compare the time spent daily at different PA levels (No activity (NPA), Light PA (LPA), Moderate PA (MPA), and Vigorous PA (VPA)) with healthy subjects (HS), and to examine the association of PA with disability, and clinical measures in PwMS. Methods: We assessed 58 PwMS (mean age +/- standard deviation, SD 39.1 +/- 10.6years) and 20 HS (mean age +/- SD 39.3 +/- 8.9 years). Demographic and clinical data were recorded at the hospital during the baseline assessment. Subjects wore the wrist GENEActiv accelerometer for 7-days. Data were collected at 100 Hz and summarized into a motor activity (MA) index using 60 s epochs with the following thresholds: MANPA-LPA: 10mG, MALPA-MPA: 100mG, MAMPA-VPA: 350mG. Results: PwMS show higher NPA and lower VPA compared to matched healthy subjects (NPA: Mean +/- SD, HS: 7.2 +/- 0.9 h/day; PwMS: 8.1 +/- 1.2 h/day, p<0.01; VPA: HS: 0.78 +/- 0.42 h/day; PwMS: 0.50 +/- 0.40 h/day, p = 0.01), while no between group differences were observed for LPA and MPA (p>0.05). Bivariate analysis showed that higher NPA was associated with fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale, FSS score) in PwMS with EDSS 0-1.5 (r = 0.34, p = 0.05). In PwMS with EDSS 2-2.5, NPA was correlated with Six Minute Walk Test (6MWT, r=-0.45, p = 0.02) and CIQ (r=-0.41, p = 0.04), while VPA was more associated with FSS (R= -0.38, p = 0.06). Conclusion: The PA level of PwMS differs from that of healthy subjects even in early diagnosed subjects. In PwMS with EDSS 0-1.5 only, fatigue is associated to prolonged inactive behavior. Conversely, in PwMS with EDSS 2-2.5 both inactivity and vigorous activities are modulated by fatigue, endurance and associated with different level of social participation.","[Gervasoni, Elisa; Anastasi, Denise; Rovaris, Marco; Carpinella, Ilaria; Rabuffetti, Marco; Cattaneo, Davide] IRCCS Fdn Don Carlo Gnocchi, Via Capecelatro 66, I-20148 Milan, Italy; [Di Giovanni, Rachele; Solaro, Claudio] Rehabil Dept, CRRF Mons Novarese, I-13040 Moncrivello, VC, Italy; [Brichetto, Giampaolo; Tacchino, Andrea] Italian Multiple Sclerosis Fdn FISM, Sci Res Area, via Operai 40, I-16149 Genoa, Italy; [Confalonieri, Paolo] IRCCS Fdn Carlo Besta Neurol Inst, Multiple Sclerosis Ctr, Milan, Italy; [Cattaneo, Davide] Univ Milan, Dept Physiopathol & Transplants, I-20100 Milan, Italy",IRCCS Fondazione Don Carlo Gnocchi Onlus; IRCCS Istituto Neurologico Besta; University of Milan,"Rabuffetti, M (corresponding author), IRCCS Fdn Don Carlo Gnocchi, Via Capecelatro 66, I-20148 Milan, Italy.",mrabuffetti@dongnocchi.it,"Gervasoni, Elisa/J-1723-2018; Carpinella, Ilaria/K-1572-2016","Gervasoni, Elisa/0000-0002-6057-591X; RABUFFETTI, MARCO/0000-0003-2089-1333; Carpinella, Ilaria/0000-0001-7486-0706; Rabuffetti, Marco/0000-0003-1638-7978",Italian Foundation Multiple Sclerosis (FISM grant) [N16/17/F14]; Italian Ministry of Health,"Italian Foundation Multiple Sclerosis (FISM grant); Italian Ministry of Health(Ministry of Health, Italy)","Italian Foundation Multiple Sclerosis (FISM grant 2016, N16/17/F14) , Italian Ministry of Health (Ricerca Corrente)",,38,1,1,2,3,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",2211-0348,2211-0356,,MULT SCLER RELAT DIS,Mult.

Several objective measures of UL function are proposed; however, their use is mostly confined to assess subjects with mild-to-moderate disability and requires fine motor skills, often impaired in high disability level subjects. Thus, a tool to score UL function in the advanced disease stage is lacking. The aim of the study is to analyse and compare UL unilateral and bilateral movements of healthy control (HC) and PwMS, at different disability levels, using an instrumented version (Inertial Measurement Unit, IMU) of the 15-seconds finger-to-nose test (FNT). Each movement cycle was segmented in going/adjusting/returning phases. The inter-hand interval (IHI) allowed assessing bilateral coordination (i.e. synchrony) in each phase. The larger IHI, the more severe the bilateral coordination impairment is. After stratifying PwMS for disability level (PwMSLOW, Expanded Disability Status Scale, EDSS <= 5.5 and PwMSHIGH, EDSS >= 6), the ANOVA on IHI showed significant differences between PwMS and HC (p<0.001) in all phases. However, only the going phase IHI showed significantly higher asynchrony in PwMSHIGH than PwMSLOW and HC (p<0.001) and no differences between PwMSLOW and HC. The going phase IHI seems to be a clinical marker specific for high disability level PwMS. These findings suggest inertial sensors during FNT could be an easy-to-use method for a more detailed quantitative characterization of UL function in PwMS also in subjects with EDSS greater than 6.","[Di Giovanni, R.; Solaro, C.; Grange, E.; Masuccio, F.

Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) may capture a richer representation of healthy and MS-related ambulatory characteristics from the raw smartphone-based inertial sensor data than standard feature-based methodologies. To overcome the typical limitations associated with remotely generated health data, such as low subject numbers, sparsity, and heterogeneous data, a transfer learning (TL) model from similar large open-source datasets was proposed. Our TL framework leveraged the ambulatory information learned on human activity recognition (HAR) tasks collected from wearable smartphone sensor data. It was demonstrated that fine-tuning TL DCNN HAR models towards MS disease recognition tasks outperformed previous Support Vector Machine (SVM) feature-based methods, as well as DCNN models trained end-to-end, by upwards of 8-15%. A lack of transparency of black-box deep networks remains one of the largest stumbling blocks to the wider acceptance of deep learning for clinical applications. Ensuing work therefore aimed to visualise DCNN decisions attributed by relevance heatmaps using Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation (LRP). Through the LRP framework, the patterns captured from smartphone-based inertial sensor data that were reflective of those who are healthy versus people with MS (PwMS) could begin to be established and understood. Interpretations suggested that cadence-based measures, gait speed, and ambulation-related signal perturbations were distinct characteristics that distinguished MS disability from healthy participants. Robust and interpretable outcomes, generated from high-frequency out-of-clinic assessments, could greatly augment the current in-clinic assessment picture for PwMS, to inform better disease management techniques, and enable the development of better therapeutic interventions.","[Creagh, Andrew P.; De Vos, Maarten] Univ Oxford, Inst Biomed Engn, Dept Engn Sci, Oxford, England; [Lipsmeier, Florian; Lindemann, Michael] F Hoffmann La Roche, Basel, Switzerland; [De Vos, Maarten] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Elect Engn, Leuven, Belgium; [De Vos, Maarten] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Dev & Regenerat, Leuven, Belgium",University of Oxford; Roche Holding; KU Leuven; KU Leuven,"Creagh, AP (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Inst Biomed Engn, Dept Engn Sci, Oxford, England.",andrew.creagh@eng.ox.ac.uk,"Lindemann, Michael/ABD-1137-2021",,F.

Despite this, monitoring and measuring fatigue (subjective lack of energy)- and fatigability (objectively measurable and quantifiable performance decline)- in people with MS have remained challenging. Traditionally, administration of self-report questionnaires during in-person visits has been used to measure fatigue. However, remote measurement and monitoring of fatigue and fatigability have become feasible in the past decade. Traditional questionnaires can be administered through the web in any setting. The ubiquitous availability of smartphones allows for momentary and frequent measurement of MS fatigue in the ecological home-setting. This approach reduces the recall bias inherent in many traditional questionnaires and demonstrates the fluctuation of fatigue that cannot be captured by standard measures. Wearable devices can assess patients' fatigability and activity levels, often influenced by the severity of subjective fatigue. Remote monitoring of fatigue, fatigability, and activity in real-world situations can facilitate quantifying symptom-severity in clinical and research settings. Combining remote measures of fatigue as well as objective fatigability in a single construct, composite score, may provide a more comprehensive outcome. The more granular data obtained through remote monitoring techniques may also help with the development of interventions aimed at improving fatigue and lowering the burden of this disabling symptom.","[Block, Valerie J.; Bove, Riley] Univ Calif San Francisco, Weill Inst Neurosci, Dept Neurol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Nourbakhsh, Bardia] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Neurol, Baltimore, MD USA",University of California System; University of California San Francisco; Johns Hopkins University,"Block, VJ (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Weill Inst Neurosci, Dept Neurol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",Valerie.block@ucsf.edu,,,,,,,93,0,0,0,0,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-2295,,,FRONT NEUROL,Front.

However, there is limited evidence that levels of physical activity and fitness are associated with cognition in progressive MS. Objective: We examined associations among cardiorespiratory fitness, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), and cognitive performance in a large, international progressive MS sample. Methods: Two hundred forty European and North American persons with progressive MS underwent cardiorespiratory fitness measurement on a recumbent stepper, wore an ActiGraph GT3X + accelerometer for 7 days for measuring MVPA, and underwent the Brief International Cognitive Assessment in MS. Results: Cardiorespiratory fitness was not significantly correlated with Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT; r = -0.01; r = -0.04), California Verbal Learning Test-II (CVLT-II; r = 0.05; r = 0.05), or Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised (BVMT-R; r = -0.14; r = -0.14) z-scores controlling for age, sex, and education. MVPA and SDMT (r = 0.05), CVLT-II (r = -0.07), and BVMT-R (r = 0.01) z-scores were not significantly correlated. Conclusion: Cardiorespiratory fitness and MVPA were not associated with cognition in this large progressive MS sample, yet these outcomes represent critical manipulation checks for documenting the success of the CogEx trial. This highlights the importance of examining other exercise-related mechanisms-of-action for improving cognition in progressive MS.","[Sandroff, Brian M.; Chiaravalloti, Nancy D.; DeLuca, John] Kessler Fdn, 1199 Pleasant Valley Way, W Orange, NJ 07052 USA; [Sandroff, Brian M.; Chiaravalloti, Nancy D.; DeLuca, John] Rutgers New Jersey Med Sch, Dept Phys Med & Rehabil, Newark, NJ USA; [Motl, Robert W.] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Phys Therapy, Birmingham, AL USA; [Amato, Maria Pia] Univ Florence, Dept NEUROFARBA, Sect Neurosci, Florence, Italy; [Amato, Maria Pia] Fdn IRCCS Don Carlo Gnocchi ONLUS, Florence, Italy; [Brichetto, Giampaolo] Italian Multiple Sclerosis Fdn FISM, Sci Res Area, Genoa, Italy; [Brichetto, Giampaolo] Italian Multiple Sclerosis Soc, AISM Rehabil Serv, Genoa, Italy; [Chataway, Jeremy] UCL, Fac Brain Sci, UCL Queen Sq Inst Neurol, Sclerosis Ctr,Dept Neuroinflammat, London, England; [Chataway, Jeremy] Univ Coll London Hosp, Biomed Res Ctr, Natl Inst Hlth Res, London, England; [Cutter, Gary R.] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Biostat, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; [Dalgas, Ulrik] Aarhus Univ, Dept Publ Hlth, Exercise Biol, Aarhus, Denmark; [Farrell, Rachel] UCL, Fac Brain Sci, UCT Queen Sq Inst Neurol, Queen Sq Multiple Sclerosis Ctr,Dept Neuroinflamm, London, England; [Feys, Peter] Hasselt Univ, Fac Rehabil Sci, Rehabil Res Ctr REVAL, Diepenbeek, Belgium; [Filippi, Massimo; Rocca, Maria A.] Univ Vita Salute San Raffaele, San Raffaele Sci Inst, Div Neurosci, Neuroimaging Res Unit,Neurol Unit, Milan, Italy; [Freeman, Jennifer] Univ Plymouth, Fac Hlth, Plymouth, Devon, England; [Inglese, Matilde] Univ Genoa, Dept Neurosci Rehabil Ophthalmol Genet Maternal &, Genoa, Italy; [Inglese, Matilde] IRCCS Osped Policlin San Martino, Genoa, Italy; [Meza, Cecilia; Feinstein, Anthony] Univ Toronto, Sunnybrook Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Psychiat, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Salter, Amber] Univ Texas Southwestern Med Ctr Dallas, Dallas, TX 75390 USA",Kessler Institute for Rehabilitation; Rutgers State University New Brunswick; Rutgers State University Medical Center; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Birmingham; University of Florence; University of London; University College London; University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust; University of London; University College London; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Birmingham; Aarhus University; University of London; University College London; Hasselt University; Vita-Salute San Raffaele University; IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele; University of Plymouth; University of Genoa; University of Toronto; Sunnybrook Health Science Center; Sunnybrook Research Institute; University of Texas System; University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Dallas,"Sandroff, BM (corresponding author), Kessler Fdn, 1199 Pleasant Valley Way, W Orange, NJ 07052 USA.",bsandroff@kesslerfoundation.org,"Amato, Maria Pia/AAC-5940-2022; Inglese, Matilde/AAH-3189-2020","Inglese, Matilde/0000-0002-9610-0297; Sandroff, Brian/0000-0002-2013-7632; amato, Maria Pia/0000-0003-3325-3760; Chiaravalloti, Nancy/0000-0003-2943-7567; Farrell, Rachel A/0000-0002-2767-3382; Dalgas, Ulrik/0000-0003-4132-2789; Cutter, Gary/0000-0002-8455-980X",Multiple Sclerosis Society of Canada [EGID3185],Multiple Sclerosis Society of Canada,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was funded by a grant from the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Canada (grant no. #EGID3185).",,35,2,2,2,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1352-4585,1477-0970,,MULT SCLER J,Mult.

Characteristic tremor frequencies in MS have a broad distribution range (1-10 Hz), which confounds the diagnostic from other forms of tremors. In this study, we propose a classification method for distinguishing MS tremors from other forms of cerebellar tremors. Methods Electromyogram (EMG), accelerometer and clinical data were obtained from a total of 120 [40 MS, 41 essential tremor (ET) and 39 Parkinson's disease (PD)] subjects. The proposed method - Soft Decision Wavelet Decomposition (SDWD) - was used to compute power spectral densities and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed for the automatic classification of the tremors. Association between the spectral features and clinical features (FTM - Fahn-Tolosa-Marin scale, UPDRS - Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale), was assessed using a support vector regression (SVR) model. Findings Our developed analytical framework achieved an accuracy of up to 91.67% using accelerometer data and up to 91.60% using EMG signals for the differentiation of MS tremors and the tremors from ET and PD. In addition, SVR further revealed strong significant correlations between the selected discriminators and the clinical scores. Interpretation The proposed method, with high classification accuracy and strong correlations of these features to clinical outcomes, has clearly demonstrated the potential to complement the existing tremor-diagnostic approach in MS patients.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammation of the central nervous system and self-management is necessary for MS patients. The purpose of the present study was to develop a smartphone-based application for self-management in multiple sclerosis. Methods. This research was conducted in two phases. In the first phase, users' requirements were investigated by using a questionnaire. The participants were 120 MS patients and six neurologists. In the second phase, a prototype of the application was designed and its usability was evaluated by using QUIS questionnaire. Results. Most of the proposed educational content, data elements, and the application functions, such as medication time reminder, assessing the severity of fatigue, and calculating the score of the Fatigue Severity Scale were found necessary to be included in the application. Finally, the usability of the application was evaluated by the users and the average of mean values was 7.6 out of 9 which indicated a good level of user satisfaction. Conclusions. The application designed in this study was able to collect patient data and facilitated consulting physicians at the point of need. It is expected that the patients' quality of life and health status can be improved by using this application. However, more research is required to investigate the efficiency and effectiveness of this application in terms of reducing the number of visits to the medical centers, improving self-management skills of MS patients and their quality of life.","[Mokhberdezfuli, Mahdieh] Iran Univ Med Sci, Sch Hlth Management & Informat Sci, Dept Hlth Informat Management, Tehran, Iran; [Mokhberdezfuli, Mahdieh; Moghadasi, Abdorreza Naser] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Multiple Sclerosis Res Ctr, Neurosci Inst, Tehran, Iran; [Ayatollahi, Haleh] Iran Univ Med Sci, Hlth Management & Econ Res Ctr, Tehran, Iran",Iran University of Medical Sciences; Tehran University of Medical Sciences; Iran University of Medical Sciences,"Ayatollahi, H (corresponding author), Iran Univ Med Sci, Hlth Management & Econ Res Ctr, Tehran, Iran.",ayatollahi.h@iums.ac.ir,"Ayatollahi, Haleh/N-1252-2018","Ayatollahi, Haleh/0000-0003-3974-3648; mokhberdezfuli, mahdieh/0000-0002-3681-0115",Iran University of Medical Sciences [IUMS/SHMIS_97-4-37-13728],Iran University of Medical Sciences,"This study was funded and supported by the Iran University of Medical Sciences (IUMS/SHMIS_97-4-37-13728), the authors gratefully acknowledge this financial support.",,37,3,3,0,4,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",2040-2295,2040-2309,,J HEALTHC ENG,J.

This analysis aimed to explore regional neural correlates of digital measures derived from these tests. Methods In a 24-week, non-randomized, interventional, feasibility study (NCT02952911), sensor-based tests on the Floodlight Proof-of-Concept app were used to assess cognition (smartphone-based electronic Symbol Digit Modalities Test), upper extremity function (Draw a Shape Test, Pinching Test), and gait and balance (Static Balance Test, Two-Minute Walk Test, U-Turn Test). In this post-hoc analysis, digital measures and standard clinical measures (e.g., Nine-Hole Peg Test [9HPT]) were correlated against regional structural magnetic resonance imaging outcomes. Seventy-six PwMS aged 18-55 years with an Expanded Disability Status Scale score of 0.0-5.5 were enrolled from two different sites (USA and Spain). Sixty-two PwMS were included in this analysis. Results Worse performance on digital and clinical measures was associated with smaller regional brain volumes and larger ventricular volumes. Whereas digital and clinical measures had many neural correlates in common (e.g., putamen, globus pallidus, caudate nucleus, lateral occipital cortex), some were observed only for digital measures. For example, Draw a Shape Test and Pinching Test measures, but not 9HPT score, correlated with volume of the hippocampus (r = 0.37 [drawing accuracy over time on the Draw a Shape Test]/ - 0.45 [touching asynchrony on the Pinching Test]), thalamus (r = 0.38/ - 0.41), and pons (r = 0.35/ - 0.35). Conclusions Multiple neural correlates were identified for the digital measures in a cohort of people with early MS. Digital measures showed associations with brain regions that clinical measures were unable to demonstrate, thus providing potential novel information on functional ability compared with standard clinical assessments.","[Ganzetti, Marco; Holm, Sven P.; Dondelinger, Frank; Gaetano, Laura; Craveiro, Licinio; Lipsmeier, Florian; Bernasconi, Corrado; Lindemann, Michael] F Hoffmann La Roche Ltd, Basel, Switzerland; [Graves, Jennifer S.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Neurosci, San Diego, CA USA; [Midaglia, Luciana; Montalban, Xavier] Hosp Universitari Vall Hebron, Ctr Esclerosi Multiple Catalunya Cemcat, Dept Neurol Neuroimmunol, Barcelona, Spain; [Midaglia, Luciana; Montalban, Xavier] Autonomous Univ Barcelona, Dept Med, Barcelona, Spain; [Hauser, Stephen L.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Neurol, San Francisco, CA USA; [Dondelinger, Frank] Novartis Inst Biomed Res, Basel, Switzerland",Roche Holding; University of California System; University of California San Diego; Hospital Universitari Vall d'Hebron; Autonomous University of Barcelona; University of California System; University of California San Francisco; Novartis,"Lipsmeier, F (corresponding author), F Hoffmann La Roche Ltd, Basel, Switzerland.",florian.lipsmeier@roche.com,"Montalban, Xavier/J-5938-2016","Montalban, Xavier/0000-0002-0098-9918; Graves, Jennifer/0000-0003-1539-1940; Holm, Sven/0000-0001-5947-3388; midaglia, luciana/0000-0001-7981-2228; Craveiro, Licinio/0000-0002-8841-8035; Dondelinger, Frank/0000-0003-1816-6300; Gaetano, Laura/0000-0002-5214-2858; Bernasconi, Corrado/0000-0002-1019-5468",Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd,Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd(Hoffmann-La Roche),"We would like to thank all patients, their families, and the investigators who participated in this trial.

Progressive MS is untreatable and relentless, and its cause is unknown. Prior studies of MS have documented neuronal accumulation of phosphorylated tau protein, which characterizes another heterogeneous group of neurogenerative disorders, the tauopathies. Known causes of tauopathy are myriad, and include point mutations within the tau gene, amyloid beta accumulation, repeated head trauma, and viral infection. We and others have proposed that tau has essential features of a prion. It forms intracellular assemblies that can exit a cell, enter a secondary cell, and serve as templates for their own replication in a process termed seeding. We have previously developed specialized biosensor cell systems to detect and quantify tau seeds in brain tissues. We hypothesized that progressive MS is a tauopathy, potentially triggered by inflammation. We tested for and detected tau seeding in frozen brain tissue of 6/8 subjects with multiple sclerosis. We then evaluated multiple brain regions from a single subject for whom we had detailed clinical history. We observed seeding outside of MS plaques that was enriched by immunopurification with two anti-tau antibodies (HJ8.5 and MD3.1). Immunohistochemistry with AT8 and MD3.1 confirmed prior reports of tau accumulation in MS. Although larger studies are required, our data suggest that progressive MS may be considered a secondary tauopathy.","[LaCroix, Michael S.; Mirbaha, Hilda; Diamond, Marc, I] Univ Texas Southwestern Med Ctr Dallas, Peter ODonnell Jr Brain Inst, Ctr Alzheimers & Neurodegenerat Dis, NL 10-120,6000 Harry Hines Blvd, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Mirbaha, Hilda; Shang, Ping; Foong, Chan; White, Charles L.] UT Southwestern Med Ctr, Dept Pathol, Dallas, TX USA; [Zandee, Stephanie; Prat, Alexandre] Ctr Rech Ctr Hosp Univ Montreal CRCHUM, Neuroimmunol Res Lab, Montreal, PQ H2X 0A9, Canada; [Stuve, Olaf; Diamond, Marc, I] UT Southwestern Med Ctr, Dept Neurol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Stuve, Olaf] VA North Texas Hlth Care Syst, Neurol Sect, Dallas, TX USA; [Zandee, Stephanie; Prat, Alexandre] Univ Montreal, Fac Med, Dept Neurosci, Montreal, PQ H3T 1J4, Canada",University of Texas System; University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Dallas; University of Texas System; University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Dallas; Universite de Montreal; University of Texas System; University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Dallas; US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); VA North Texas Health Care System; Universite de Montreal,"Diamond, MI (corresponding author), Univ Texas Southwestern Med Ctr Dallas, Peter ODonnell Jr Brain Inst, Ctr Alzheimers & Neurodegenerat Dis, NL 10-120,6000 Harry Hines Blvd, Dallas, TX 75390 USA.;Diamond, MI (corresponding author), UT Southwestern Med Ctr, Dept Neurol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA.",marc.diamond@utsouthwestern.edu,,"Zandee, Stephanie/0000-0003-0812-676X; Diamond, Marc/0000-0002-8085-7770",Chan Zuckerberg Initiative; NIH/NIA [1R01AG059689]; Winspear Family Center for Research on the Neuropathology of Alzheimer Disease; McCune Foundation,Chan Zuckerberg Initiative; NIH/NIA(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); Winspear Family Center for Research on the Neuropathology of Alzheimer Disease; McCune Foundation,"This work was supported by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and NIH/NIA 1R01AG059689 (M.I.D., C.L.W.); the Winspear Family Center for Research on the Neuropathology of Alzheimer Disease; the McCune Foundation (C.L.W).",,28,0,0,1,1,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2051-5960,,,ACTA NEUROPATHOL COM,Acta Neuropathol.

Objective: This study examined cross-sectional associations among device-measured sedentary and physical activity behavior with perceived sleep quality in adults with MS. Methods: Adults with MS (N = 290) completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and wore an accelerometer for seven days providing a measure of time spent in sedentary behavior, light physical activity (LPA), and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) using MS-specific cut-points. We conducted multiple linear regression analysis to identify the independent contributions of variables for explaining PSQI scores. Results: The overall model accounted for 2% of the variance in global PSQI scores, and MVPA was significantly and independently associated with global PSQI scores (beta = -0.123; p = 0.045; partial r = -0.118) when accounting for average wear time, sedentary behavior, and time spent in LPA. There were no other significant associations with PSQI global score. Conclusions: Our results suggest that time spent in MVPA may be associated with better sleep quality in adults with MS, but adults with MS do not spend sufficient time in physical activity. Researchers should evaluate these relationships in longitudinal study designs and behavior change interventions, as physical activity may provide a unique opportunity to improve sleep quality outcomes.

Inertial sensors (IMUs) could overcome this drawback. Nevertheless, IMUs are not yet fully integrated into clinical practice due to issues including the difficulty to understand/interpret the big number of parameters provided and the lack of cut-off values to identify possible abnormalities. In an attempt to overcome these limitations, an instrumented modified Romberg test (ImRomberg: standing on foam with eyes closed while wearing an IMU on the trunk) was administered to 81 early-stage PwMS and 38 healthy subjects (HS). To facilitate clinical interpretation, 21 IMU-based parameters were computed and reduced through principal component analysis into two components, sway complexity and sway intensity, descriptive of independent aspects of balance, presenting a clear clinical meaning and significant correlations with at least one clinical scale. Compared to HS, early-stage PwMS showed a 228% reduction in sway complexity and a 63% increase in sway intensity, indicating, respectively, a less automatic (more conscious) balance control and larger and faster trunk movements during upright posture. Cut-off values were derived to identify the presence of balance abnormalities and if these abnormalities are clinically meaningful. By applying these thresholds and integrating the ImRomberg test with the clinical tandem gait test, balance impairments were identified in 58% of PwMS versus the 17% detected by traditional Romberg and tandem gait tests. The higher sensitivity of the proposed approach would allow for the direct identification of early-stage PwMS who could benefit from preventive rehabilitation interventions aimed at slowing MS-related functional decline during neurological examinations and with minimal modifications to the tests commonly performed.","[Carpinella, Ilaria; Anastasi, Denise; Gervasoni, Elisa; Rovaris, Marco; Ferrarin, Maurizio; Cattaneo, Davide] IRCCS Fdn Don Carlo Gnocchi Onlus, I-20148 Milan, Italy; [Di Giovanni, Rachele; Solaro, Claudio] Ctr Recupero & Rieducaz Funzionale CRRF Mons Luigi, Dept Rehabil, I-13040 Moncrivello, Italy; [Tacchino, Andrea; Brichetto, Giampaolo] Italian Multiple Sclerosis Fdn, I-16126 Genoa, Italy; [Confalonieri, Paolo] IRCCS Fdn Carlo Besta Neurol Inst, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Cattaneo, Davide] Univ Milan, Dept Physiopathol & Transplants, I-20122 Milan, Italy",IRCCS Istituto Neurologico Besta; University of Milan,"Anastasi, D (corresponding author), IRCCS Fdn Don Carlo Gnocchi Onlus, I-20148 Milan, Italy.",danastasi@dongnocchi.it,"Ferrarin, Maurizio/I-3230-2012; Carpinella, Ilaria/K-1572-2016","Ferrarin, Maurizio/0000-0002-7797-2399; Solaro, Claudio Marcello/0000-0002-6713-4623; Cattaneo, Davide/0000-0003-4251-1856; Carpinella, Ilaria/0000-0001-7486-0706","Italian Multiple Sclerosis Foundation (FISM), FISM grant [N16/17/F14]; Italian Ministry of Health; Ricerca Corrente","Italian Multiple Sclerosis Foundation (FISM), FISM grant; Italian Ministry of Health(Ministry of Health, Italy); Ricerca Corrente(Ministry of Health, ItalyMinistry of Health Italy - Ricerca Corrente (MOH-RC))","This research was funded by the Italian Multiple Sclerosis Foundation (FISM), FISM grant 2016, number N16/17/F14, and by the Italian Ministry of Health, funding from Ricerca Corrente 2022.",,85,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,DEC,2022,22,23,,,,,,,9558,10.3390/s22239558,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s22239558,,,21,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,6Y8IB,36502265,"gold, Green Accepted",,,2023-02-20,WOS:000897331000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Previous work focused on studying activity levels or activity volume, but studies of daily-living rest-activity fragmentation patterns, circadian rhythms, and fractal regulation in pwMS are limited. Based on findings in other cohorts, one could suggest that these aspects of daily-living physical activity will provide additional information about the health and well-being of pwMS. Therefore, here, we aimed to (1) identify which fragmentation, fractal, and circadian amplitude measures differ between pwMS and healthy controls, (2) evaluate the relationship between fragmentation, fractal, and circadian amplitude measures and disease severity, and (3) begin to evaluate the added value of those measures, as compared to more conventional measures of physical activity (e.g., mean signal vector magnitude (SVM). A global measure of the overall volume of physical activity). Methods: 132 people with relapsing-remitting MS (47 +/- 11 yrs, 69.7% female, Expanded Disability Status Scale, EDSS, median (IQR): 3 (2-4)) and 90 healthy controls (46 +/- 11 yrs, 47.8% female) were asked to wear a 3D accelerometer on their lower back for 7 days. Rest-activity fragmentation, circadian amplitude, fractal regulation, and mean SVM metrics were extracted. PwMS and healthy controls were compared using independent samples t-tests and linear regression, including comparisons adjusted for mean SVM to control for the effect of physical activity volume. Spearman correlations between measures and logistic regressions were used to identify the clinical condition based on the measures that differed significantly after adjusting for SVM. All analyses included adjustments for demographic and clinical parameters (e.g., age, sex). Results: Multiple measures of activity fragmentation significantly differed between pwMS and healthy controls, reflecting a more fragmented active behavior in pwMS. PwMS had a lower circadian rhythm amplitude, indicating a smaller amplitude in the circadian changes of daily activity, and weaker temporal correlations as based on the fractal analysis. When taking into account physical activity volume, one circadian amplitude measure and one fractal measure remained significantly different in pwMS and controls. Fragmentation measures and circadian amplitude measures were significantly associated with disability level as measured by the EDSS; the association with circadian amplitude remained significant, even after adjusting for the mean SVM. Conclusion: The physical activity patterns of pwMS differ from those of healthy individuals in rest-activity fragmentation, the amplitude of the circadian rhythm, and fractal regulation. Measures describing these aspects of activity provide information that is not captured in the total volume of physical activity and could, perhaps, augment the monitoring of disease progression and evaluation of the response to interventions.","[Salomon, Amit; Galperin, Irina; Buzaglo, David; Mirelman, Anat; Gazit, Eran; Hausdorff, Jeffrey M.] Tel Aviv Sourasky Med Ctr, Ctr Study Movement Cognit & Mobil, Neurol Inst, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Mirelman, Anat; Karni, Arnon; Hausdorff, Jeffrey M.] Tel Aviv Univ, Sagol Sch Neurosci, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Mirelman, Anat; Karni, Arnon] Tel Aviv Univ, Sackler Fac Med, Dept Neurol, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Regev, Keren; Karni, Arnon] Tel Aviv Sourasky Med Ctr, Neurol Div, Neuroimmunol & Multiple Sclerosis Unit, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Schmitz-Hubsch, Tanja; Paul, Friedemann] Charite Univ Med Berlin, NeuroCure, Berlin, Germany; [Schmitz-Hubsch, Tanja; Paul, Friedemann] Max Delbrueck Ctr Mol Med, Expt & Clin Res Ctr, Berlin, Germany; [Schmitz-Hubsch, Tanja; Paul, Friedemann] Charite Univ Med Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Paul, Friedemann] Charite Univ Med Berlin, Dept Neurol, Berlin, Germany; [Devos, Hannes; Sosnoff, Jacob J.] Univ Kansas, Med Ctr, Mobil Consortium, Dept Phys Therapy Rehabil Sci & Athlet Training,S, Kansas City, KS 66103 USA; [Sosnoff, Jacob J.] Univ Illinois, Interdisciplinary Hlth Sci Inst, Illinois Multiple Sclerosis Res Collaborat, Urbana, IL USA; [Tamir, Raz; Shimoni, Nathaniel] Owlyt Healthcare Ltd, Ramat Gan, Israel; [Hausdorff, Jeffrey M.] Tel Aviv Univ, Sackler Fac Med, Dept Phys Therapy, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Hausdorff, Jeffrey M.] Rush Univ, Med Ctr, Rush Alzheimers Dis Ctr, Chicago, IL USA; [Hausdorff, Jeffrey M.] Rush Univ, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Med Ctr, Chicago, IL USA",Tel Aviv University; Sackler Faculty of Medicine; Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center; Tel Aviv University; Tel Aviv University; Sackler Faculty of Medicine; Tel Aviv University; Sackler Faculty of Medicine; Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center; Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin; Helmholtz Association; Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine; Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin; Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin; University of Kansas; University of Kansas Medical Center; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Tel Aviv University; Sackler Faculty of Medicine; Rush University; Rush University,"Hausdorff, JM (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Sourasky Med Ctr, Ctr Study Movement Cognit & Mobil, Neurol Inst, Tel Aviv, Israel.",jhausdor@tlvmc.gov.il,"Hausdorff, Jeffrey/HLH-2392-2023","Galperin, Irina/0000-0002-8373-6915",National Multiple Sclerosis Society; Israel Innovation Authority; Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 Joint Undertaking [820820]; European Union?s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program; EFPIA,National Multiple Sclerosis Society(National Multiple Sclerosis Society); Israel Innovation Authority; Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 Joint Undertaking; European Union?s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program; EFPIA,"We thank the study participants for their time and contribution to this research.

This study aimed to determine the effects of Continuous Care Model (CCM) using a smartphone application on adherence to treatment and self-efficacy among MS patients. Methods This quasi-experimental study with pre/posttest design was conducted on 72 MS patients in Shiraz, Iran from June 2020 to August 2021. The samples were randomly assigned to intervention (n = 36) and control (n = 36) groups. In the intervention group, the CCM using a smartphone application was implemented during two months. However, no intervention was performed for the control group. The data were collected using the self-report Multiple Sclerosis Treatment Adherence Questionnaire (MS-TAQ) and MS Self-Efficacy Scale (MSSS) at baseline and two and four months after the intervention. Results The results showed an improvement in adherence to treatment and self-efficacy in the intervention group compared to the control group after implementing the virtual CCM and at the two-month follow-up (p < 0.001). Conclusions Implementing the CCM using a smartphone application resulted in improvements in the MS patients' adherence to treatment and self-efficacy. It can be concluded that providing care using an interactive multimedia application can improve the outcomes as well as patients' satisfaction, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Sedentary behavior, the other end of the activity continuum, may be targeted for improvements in physical function among adults with MS, but less is known about the relationship between sedentary behavior and physical function with increasing age in MS. This study examined the associations between device-measured volume and pattern of sedentary behavior and physical function based on SPPB (Short Physical Performance Battery) of ambulatory persons with MS across the lifespan. We categorized participants (N = 216) into young (20-39 years), middle-aged (40-59 years), and older (60-79 years) age groups. Participants completed the SPPB during a single visit to the laboratory and wore an accelerometer for a 7-day period. The one-way analysis of variance indicated no differences in volume and pattern of sedentary behavior among the three age groups, except for average sedentary bout length. Spearman bivariate correlations indicated that pattern, but not volume, of sedentary behavior was associated with physical function in young, middle-aged, and older adults, and the magnitude of these associations varied by age group. Future interventions may reduce and break up prolonged periods of sedentary behavior for improvements in physical function and possibly other consequences in persons with MS.","[Jeng, Brenda; Silic, Petra; Motl, Robert W.] Univ Illinois, Coll Appl Hlth Sci, Dept Kinesiol & Nutr, Chicago, IL 60612 USA; [Huynh, Trinh L.

However, functional mobility observed in supervised settings may not reflect daily life which may impact assessments of fall risk and impairment in the clinic. To investigate this further, we compared the utility of sensor-based performance metrics from sit-stand transitions during daily life and a structured task to inform fall risk and impairment in PwMS. Thirty-seven PwMS instrumented with wearable sensors (thigh and chest) completed supervised 30-second chair stand tests (30CST) and underwent two days of instrumented daily life monitoring. Performance metrics were computed for sit-stand transitions during daily life and 30CSTs. EDSS sub scores and fall history were used to dichotomize participants into groups: pyramidal/no pyramidal impairment, sensory/no sensory impairment and high/low fall risk. The ability of performance metrics to discriminate between groups was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC). The feature that best discriminated between high and low fall risk was a chest acceleration measurement from the supervised instrumented 30CST (AUC = 0.89). Only chest features indicated sensory impairment, however the task was different between supervised and daily life. The metric that best discriminated pyramidal impairment was a chest-derived feature (AUC = 0.89) from supervised 30CSTs. The highest AUC from daily life was observed in faller classification with the average sit-stand time (0.81). While characterizing sit-stand performance during daily life may yield insights into fall risk and may be performed without a clinic visit, there remains value to conducting supervised functional assessments to provide the best classification performance between the investigated impairments in this sample.","[Tulipani, Lindsey J.; Meyer, Brett; Fox, Samantha; Mcginnis, Ryan S.] Univ Vermont, Dept Elect & Biomed Engn, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Solomon, Andrew J.] Univ Vermont, Dept Neurol Sci, Burlington, VT 05405 USA",University of Vermont; University of Vermont,"Mcginnis, RS (corresponding author), Univ Vermont, Dept Elect & Biomed Engn, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.",lindsey.tulipani@uvm.edu; brett.meyer@uvm.edu; samantha.rfox@uvm.edu; andrew.solomon@uvm.edu; ryan.mcginnis@uvm.edu,,"McGinnis, Ryan/0000-0001-8396-6967",NIH [R21EB027852]; University of Vermont Medical Center; Koerner Family Foundation,NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); University of Vermont Medical Center; Koerner Family Foundation,"This work was supported in part by NIH under Grant R21EB027852, in part by the University of Vermont Medical Center, and in part by the Koerner Family Foundation.",,44,2,2,0,0,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1534-4320,1558-0210,,IEEE T NEUR SYS REH,IEEE Trans.

We use OWL 2 ontologies as the underlying knowledge representation formalism for modelling contextual information and high-level concepts and relations among them. The conceptual model of our framework is defined on top of existing modelling standards, such as SOSA and WADM, promoting the creation of interoperable knowledge graphs. On top of the symbolic knowledge graphs, we define a rule-based framework for infusing expert knowledge in the form of SHACL constraints and rules to recognise patterns, anomalies and situations of interest based on the predefined and stored rules and conditions. A dashboard visualizes both sensor data and detected events to facilitate clinical supervision and decision making. Preliminary results on the performance and scalability are presented, while a focus group of clinicians involved in an exploratory research study revealed their preferences and perspectives to shape future clinical research using the framework.","[Stavropoulos, Thanos G.; Meditskos, Georgios; Lazarou, Ioulietta; Mpaltadoros, Lampros; Kompatsiaris, Ioannis] Inst Informat Technol, Ctr Res Technol Hellas, 6th Km Charilaou Thermi, Thessaloniki 57001, Greece; [Meditskos, Georgios] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Informat, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece; [Papagiannopoulos, Sotirios] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Med, Dept Neurol 3, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece; [Tsolaki, Magda] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Med, Dept Neurol 1, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece",Centre for Research & Technology Hellas; Aristotle University of Thessaloniki; Aristotle University of Thessaloniki; Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,"Meditskos, G (corresponding author), Inst Informat Technol, Ctr Res Technol Hellas, 6th Km Charilaou Thermi, Thessaloniki 57001, Greece.;Meditskos, G (corresponding author), Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Informat, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece.",athstavr@iti.gr; gmeditsk@csd.auth.gr; iouliettalaz@iti.gr; lamprosmpalt@iti.gr; spapagia@auth.gr; tsolakim1@gmail.com; ikom@iti.gr,"Meditskos, Georgios/AGO-3230-2022; Kompatsiaris, Ioannis (Yiannis)/P-8594-2015","Meditskos, Georgios/0000-0003-4242-5245; Tsolaki, Magda/0000-0002-2072-8010; Mpaltadoros, Lampros/0000-0001-8652-7628; Lazarou, Ioulietta/0000-0001-5113-8366; Stavropoulos, Thanos G./0000-0003-2389-4329; Kompatsiaris, Ioannis (Yiannis)/0000-0001-6447-9020","Greece and the European Union (European Social Fund- ESF) through the Operational Programme Human Resources Development, Education and Lifelong Learning 2014-2020 [MIS 5050689]","Greece and the European Union (European Social Fund- ESF) through the Operational Programme Human Resources Development, Education and Lifelong Learning 2014-2020","This research is co-financed by Greece and the European Union (European Social Fund- ESF) through the Operational Programme Human Resources Development, Education and Lifelong Learning 2014-2020 in the context of the project eHealth4MS: Electronic Health for the Care of Multiple Sclerosis (MIS 5050689).",,60,1,1,2,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,SEP,2021,21,18,,,,,,,6230,10.3390/s21186230,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s21186230,,,28,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,UW1WA,34577437,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-02-20,WOS:000699953900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

It can therefore potentially reveal subtle impairments in early-stage people with multiple sclerosis who still show normal locomotion (NW-PwMS). This would help in identifying those subjects who can benefit from early preventive exercise aimed at slowing the MS-related functional decline. ObjectivesTo analyze if the assessment of walking with horizontal head turns (WHHT) through inertial sensors can discriminate between healthy subjects (HS) and NW-PwMS and between NW-PwMS subgroups. To assess if the discriminant ability of the instrumented WHHT is higher compared to clinical scores. To assess the concurrent validity of the sensor-based metrics. MethodsIn this multicenter study, 40 HS and 59 NW-PwMS [Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) <= 2.5, disease duration <= 5 years] were tested. Participants executed Item-6 of the Fullerton Advanced Balance scale-short (FAB-s) wearing three inertial sensors on the trunk and ankles. The item required to horizontally turn the head at a beat of the metronome (100 bpm) while walking. Signals of the sensors were processed to compute spatiotemporal, regularity, symmetry, dynamic stability, and trunk sway metrics descriptive of WHHT. ResultsMediolateral regularity, anteroposterior symmetry, and mediolateral stability were reduced in NW-PwMS vs. HS (p <= 0.001), and showed moderate discriminant ability (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve [AUC]: 0.71-0.73). AP symmetry and ML stability were reduced (p <= 0.026) in EDSS: 2-2.5 vs. EDSS: 0-1.5 subgroup (AUC: 0.69-0.70). The number of NW-PwMS showing at least one abnormal instrumented metric (68%) was larger (p <= 0.002) than the number of participants showing abnormal FAB-s-Item6 (32%) and FAB-s clinical scores (39%). EDSS: 2-2.5 subgroup included more individuals showing abnormal instrumented metrics (86%) compared to EDSS: 0-1.5 subgroup (57%). The instrumented metrics significantly correlated with FAB-s-Item6 and FAB-s scores (|Spearman's r(s)| >= 0.37, p < 0.001), thus demonstrating their concurrent validity. ConclusionThe instrumented assessment of WHHT provided valid objective metrics that discriminated, with higher sensitivity than clinical scores, between HS and NW-PwMS and between EDSS subgroups. The method is a promising tool to complement clinical evaluation, and reveal subclinical impairments in persons who can benefit from early preventive rehabilitative interventions.","[Carpinella, Ilaria; Gervasoni, Elisa; Anastasi, Denise; Rovaris, Marco; Ferrarin, Maurizio; Cattaneo, Davide] IRCSS Fdn Don Carlo Gnocchi, Milan, Italy; [Di Giovanni, Rachele; Solaro, Claudio] Ctr Recupero & Rieducaz Funz CRRF Mons Luigi Nova, Moncrivello, Italy; [Tacchino, Andrea; Brichetto, Giampaolo] Italian Multiple Sclerosis Fdn, Sci Res Area, Genoa, Italy; [Confalonieri, Paolo] IRCCS Fdn Carlo Besta, Neurol Inst, Milan, Italy; [Cattaneo, Davide] Univ Milan, Dept Physiopathol & Transplants, Milan, Italy",IRCCS Istituto Neurologico Besta; University of Milan,"Ferrarin, M (corresponding author), IRCSS Fdn Don Carlo Gnocchi, Milan, Italy.",mferrarin@dongnocchi.it,"Gervasoni, Elisa/J-1723-2018; Ferrarin, Maurizio/I-3230-2012; Carpinella, Ilaria/K-1572-2016","Gervasoni, Elisa/0000-0002-6057-591X; Ferrarin, Maurizio/0000-0002-7797-2399; Carpinella, Ilaria/0000-0001-7486-0706",Italian Multiple Sclerosis Foundation-FISM (FISM grant 2016) [N16/17/F14]; Italian Ministry of Health (Fondi di Ricerca Corrente),Italian Multiple Sclerosis Foundation-FISM (FISM grant 2016); Italian Ministry of Health (Fondi di Ricerca Corrente),"This study was supported by the Italian Multiple Sclerosis Foundation-FISM (FISM grant 2016, N16/17/F14) and by the Italian Ministry of Health (Fondi di Ricerca Corrente).",,65,2,2,0,2,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-2295,,,FRONT NEUROL,Front.

Smartphone-adapted tests may enhance the assessment of function as tests can be performed more frequently and within the daily living environment. The objectives were to prove reproducibility of a smartphone-based Symbol Digit Modalities Test (sSDMT), its responsiveness to relevant change in clinical cognitive outcomes, and develop an individual-based monitoring method for cognition. Methods: In a one-year cohort study with 102 patients with MS, weekly sSDMTs were performed and analyzed on reproducibility parameters: the standard error of measurement (SEM) and smallest detectable change (SDC). Responsiveness of the sSDMT to relevant change in the 3-monthly clinically assessed SDMT (i.e. 4-point change) was quantified with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Curve fitting of the weekly sSDMT scores of individual patients was performed with a local linear trend model to estimate and visualize the de-noised cognitive state and 95% confidence interval (CI). The optimal assessment frequency was determined by analyzing the CI bandwidth as a function of sSDMT assessment frequency. Results: Weekly sSDMT showed improved reproducibility estimates (SEM=2.94, SDC=8.15) compared to the clinical SDMT. AUC-values did not exceed 0.70 in classifying relevant change in cSDMT. However, utilizing weekly sSDMT measurements, estimated state curves and the 95% CI were plotted showing detailed changes within individuals over time. With a test frequency of once per 12 days, 4-point changes in sSDMT can be detected. Conclusion: A local linear trend model applied on sSDMT scores of individual patients increases the signal-to-noise ratio substantially, which improves the detection of statistically reliable changes. Therefore, this fine-grained individual-based monitoring approach can be used to complement current clinical assessment to enhance clinical care in MS.","[Lam, Ka-Hoo; Strijbis, Eva; Uitdehaag, Bernard; Killestein, Joep] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Univ, MS Ctr Amsterdam, Dept Neurol,Med Ctr,Amsterdam Neurosci, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Bucur, Ioan Gabriel; Heskes, Tom] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Comp & Informat Sci, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Van Oirschot, Pim; De Graaf, Frank; Weda, Hans] Orikami Digital Hlth Prod, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [De Groot, Vincent] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Univ, MS Ctr Amsterdam, Dept Rehabil Med,Med Ctr,Amsterdam Neurosci, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Radboud University Nijmegen; University of Amsterdam; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Lam, KH (corresponding author), Boelelaan, NL-1117 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",k.lam1@amsterdamumc.nl,"Heskes, Tom/A-1443-2010; Strijbis, Eva M.M./AAH-7822-2021","Heskes, Tom/0000-0002-3398-5235; ","PPP Allowance by Health-Holland, Top Sector Life Sciences Health [LSHM16060-SGF]; Stichting MS Research [16-946 MS]; Dutch Research Council (NWO); Nationaal MS fonds","PPP Allowance by Health-Holland, Top Sector Life Sciences Health; Stichting MS Research; Dutch Research Council (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); Nationaal MS fonds","The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research: the collaboration project was co-funded by the PPP Allowance made available by Health-Holland, Top Sector Life Sciences & Health [grant number LSHM16060-SGF] and Stichting MS Research [grant number 16-946 MS] to stimulate public-private partnerships, and by a contribution from Biogen (unrestricted funding).

Using an elaborate validation concept several key findings were published, challenging established outcome parameters and their assessment in MS such as disability ratings with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), relapses and MRI endpoints. Sustained increase of EDSS appeared to be an invalid outcome for 2-3 year clinical trials at least in patients with relapsing-remitting MS. The number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions and T2-lesion load on MRI were shown not to have a meaningful additional predictive value for the disease course. These issues risen some 15 years ago had triggered controversial discussions which have also been noticed by regulatory authorities and they all have not been resolved. In addition the SLCMSR contributed to the development of new outcomes such as real-world walking speed as an attractive, ecologically valid tool based on a wearable device. A so-called evidence-based-decision-support tool was constructed to provide individual prognostic estimates based on a matching algorithm to a given database.

To date, researchers have applied theory such as Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) for identifying correlates of physical activity that can then inform the design and delivery of behavioral interventions. Such research often has been conducted in heterogeneous samples of persons with MS without a focus on those with a specific symptom, such as fatigue, that may be targeted by physical activity behavioral interventions. To that end, this study examined SCT variables (i.e., self-efficacy, barriers, outcome expectations, goal-setting, planning, social support, and functional limitations) as correlates of physical activity in persons with MS who self-reported elevated fatigue. Methods: Persons with MS (N=210; aged 49.6[13.2] years) who ambulated with or without assistance participated in the study. Participants completed self-report measures of fatigue, physical activity, and SCT variables and wore an ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometer on a belt around the waist for 7 days. The accelerometer data were processed and delineated into time spent in light and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) based on MS-specific cut-points. We generated groups of fatigued (n=134) and non-fatigued (n=76) persons with MS based on the cut-off score of 4 for the Fatigue Severity Scale. Results: There were differences in physical activity and SCT variables between fatigued and non-fatigued persons with MS. Among those with fatigue, functional limitations (rho=0.52), self-efficacy (rho=0.31), and goal-setting (rho=0.25) were associated with device-measured MVPA, and all SCT variables except outcome expectations were associated with self-reported physical activity. The regression analyses indicated self-efficacy, functional limitations, and goal-setting as significant correlates of MVPA in those with fatigue. Conclusion: Self-efficacy, goal-setting, and social support may be important targets of SCT-based behavioral interventions for increasing physical activity among persons with MS who have fatigue.","[Jeng, Brenda; Huynh, Trinh L.; Silic, Petra; Jones, Catherine D.; Feasel, Corey D.; Baird, Jessica F.; Motl, Robert W.] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Sch Hlth Profess 360, Dept Phys Therapy, 1720 2nd Ave 5, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; [Cederberg, Katie L.

Further, a potential correlation between gait parameters and subjective fatigue was explored. Methods Automated gait analyses were carried out on 88 MS patients and 31 healthy participants. To measure gait parameters (i.e. walking speed, stride length, stride duration, duration of stance and swing phase, minimal toe-to-floor distance), wearable inertial sensors were utilized throughout a 6-min 25-ft walk. Additionally, self-reported subjective fatigue was assessed. Results Mean gait parameters consistently revealed significant differences between healthy participants and MS patients from as early as an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) value of 1.5 onwards. Further, MS patients showed a significant linear trend in all parameters, reflecting continuously deteriorating gait performance throughout the test. This linear deterioration trend showed significant correlations with fatigue. Conclusions Wearable inertial sensors are highly sensitive in the detection of gait disturbances, even in early MS, where global scales such as the EDSS do not provide any clinical information about deviations in gait behavior. Moreover, these measures provide a linear trend parameter of gait deterioration that may serve as a surrogate marker of fatigue. In sum, these results suggest that classic timed walking tests in routine clinical practice should be replaced by readily and automatically applicable gait assessments, as provided by inertial sensors.","[Mueller, Roy] Klinikum Bayreuth GmbH, GaitLab, Bayreuth, Germany; [Mueller, Roy; Hansen, Sascha; Oschmann, Patrick; Keune, Philipp M.] Klinikum Bayreuth GmbH, Dept Neurol, Bayreuth, Germany; [Hamacher, Daniel] Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Dept Sports Sci, Jena, Germany; [Hansen, Sascha; Keune, Philipp M.] Otto Friedrich Univ, Inst Psychol, Bamberg, Germany",Klinikum Bayreuth; Klinikum Bayreuth; Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; Otto Friedrich University Bamberg,"Muller, R (corresponding author), Klinikum Bayreuth GmbH, GaitLab, Bayreuth, Germany.;Muller, R (corresponding author), Klinikum Bayreuth GmbH, Dept Neurol, Bayreuth, Germany.",roy.mueller@klinikum-bayreuth.de,"Müller, Roy/AAH-6372-2020; Hamacher, Daniel/J-6403-2019","Müller, Roy/0000-0002-4688-1515; Hamacher, Daniel/0000-0002-2296-4316","Sanofi-Aventis GmbH, Germany","Sanofi-Aventis GmbH, Germany(Sanofi-Aventis)","The current work was supported by Sanofi-Aventis GmbH, Germany.

While issues with intrusive and complex sensor placement limit practicality of multi-point IMU systems, single-point IMUs could potentially maximize patient compliance and allow inconspicuous monitoring in daily-living. Therefore, this review aimed to examine the validity of single-point IMUs for gait metrics analysis and identify studies employing them for clinical applications. Methods: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Guidelines (PRISMA) were followed utilizing the following databases: PubMed; MEDLINE; EMBASE and Cochrane. Four databases were systematically searched to obtain relevant journal articles focusing on the measurement of gait metrics using single-point IMU sensors. Results: A total of 90 articles were selected for inclusion. Critical analysis of studies was conducted, and data collected included: sensor type(s); sensor placement; study aim(s); study conclusion(s); gait metrics and methods; and clinical application. Validation research primarily focuses on lower trunk sensors in healthy cohorts. Clinical applications focus on diagnosis and severity assessment, rehabilitation and intervention efficacy and delineating pathological subjects from healthy controls. Discussion: This review has demonstrated the validity of single-point IMUs for gait metrics analysis and their ability to assist in clinical scenarios. Further validation for continuous monitoring in daily living scenarios and performance in pathological cohorts is required before commercial and clinical uptake can be expected","[Mobbs, Ralph Jasper; Perring, Jordan; Raj, Suresh Mahendra; Maharaj, Monish; Yoong, Nicole Kah Mun; Fonseka, Rannulu Dineth; Natarajan, Pragadesh; Choy, Wen Jie] Univ New South Wales, Fac Med, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Mobbs, Ralph Jasper; Perring, Jordan; Maharaj, Monish; Yoong, Nicole Kah Mun; Fonseka, Rannulu Dineth; Natarajan, Pragadesh; Choy, Wen Jie] NeuroSpine Surg Res Grp NSURG, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Mobbs, Ralph Jasper] Prince Wales Hosp, Dept Neurosurg, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Sy, Luke Wicent] Univ New South Wales, Grad Sch Biomed Engn, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Mobbs, RJ (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Fac Med, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",r.mobbs@unsw.edu.au,"Fonseka, R.

There is preliminary evidence of improved walking with a lower limb exoskeleton in persons with MS. However, the effects of exoskeleton-assisted walking on neuromuscular modifications are relatively unclear. The objective of this study was to investigate the muscle synergies, their activation patterns and the differences in neural strategies during walking with (EXO) and without (No-EXO) an exoskeleton. Methods: Ten subjects with MS performed walking during EXO and No-EXO conditions. Electromyography signals from seven leg muscles were recorded. Muscle synergies and the activation profiles were extracted using non-negative matrix factorization. Results: The stance phase duration was significantly shorter during EXO compared to the No-EXO condition (p<0.05). Moreover, typically 3-5 modules were extracted in each condition. The module-1 (comprising Vastus Medialis and Rectus Femoris muscles), module-2 (comprising Soleus and Medial Gastrocnemius muscles), module-3 (Tibialis Anterior muscle) and module-4 (comprising Biceps Femoris and Semitendinosus muscles) were comparable between conditions. During EXO condition, Semitendinosus and Vastus Medialis emerged in module-5 in 7/10 subjects. Compared to No-EXO, average activation amplitude was significantly reduced corresponding to module-2 during the stance phase and module-3 during the swing phase during EXO. Conclusion: Exoskeleton-assistance does not alter the existing synergy modules, but could induce a new module to emerge, and alters the control of these modules, i.e., modifies the neural commands indicated by the reduced amplitude of the activation profiles. Significance: The work provides insights on the potential underlying mechanism of improving gait functions after exoskeleton-assisted locomotor training.","[Afzal, Taimoor; Zhu, Fangshi; Francisco, Gerard E.; Chang, Shuo-Hsiu] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Dept Phys Med & Rehabil, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Afzal, Taimoor] Worcester Polytech Inst, Dept Biomed Engn, Worcester, MA 01609 USA; [Zhu, Fangshi; Francisco, Gerard E.; Chang, Shuo-Hsiu] Neurorecovery Res Ctr TIRR Mem Hermann, Ctr Wearable Exoskeletons, Houston, TX USA; [Tseng, Shih-Chiao] Univ Texas Med Branch, Dept Phys Therapy, Galveston, TX 77555 USA; [Lincoln, John A.] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Dept Neurol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Su, Hao] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Lab Biomechatron & Intelligent Robot, Raleigh, NC USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Health Science Center Houston; Worcester Polytechnic Institute; University of Texas System; University of Texas Medical Branch Galveston; University of Texas System; University of Texas Health Science Center Houston; North Carolina State University,"Chang, SH (corresponding author), Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Dept Phys Med & Rehabil, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",shuo-hsiu.chang@uth.tmc.edu,"Su, Hao/HHZ-1048-2022","Su, Hao/0000-0003-3299-7418; Afzal, Taimoor/0000-0002-2060-398X; Zhu, Fangshi/0000-0002-3587-5531",TIRR Foundation; National Multiple Sclerosis Society [PP3394]; NIDILRR [90DPGE0011],TIRR Foundation; National Multiple Sclerosis Society(National Multiple Sclerosis Society); NIDILRR(United States Department of Health & Human Services),"This work was supported by TIRR Foundation, National Multiple Sclerosis Society under Grant PP3394 and NIDILRR under Grant 90DPGE0011.",,35,1,1,6,8,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0018-9294,1558-2531,,IEEE T BIO-MED ENG,IEEE Trans.

Objective: This cross-sectional study assessed associations among social cognitive theory (SCT) variables and device-measured and self-reported physical activity in samples of Black and White persons with MS.Methods: Participants included 67 Black and 141 White persons with MS who wore an ActiGraph accelerometer on a belt around the waist measuring moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) for seven days and completed a battery of questionnaires. Questionnaires included demographic and clinical characteristics, leisure-time exercise, exercise self-efficacy, overcoming barriers self-efficacy, function, social support, exercise outcome expectations, and goal setting and planning.Results: Black participants with MS engaged in significantly less MVPA, but not sedentary behavior or light physical activity, than the White participants with MS. Black participants further had significantly lower levels of exercise self-efficacy and outcome expectations than the White sample. All SCT correlates were significantly correlated with self-reported physical activity, but only exercise and barriers self -efficacy, perceived function, and exercise goal setting were associated with device-measured MVPA. The difference in physical activity between Black and White participants with MS was accounted for by differences in exercise self-efficacy and outcome expectations.Conclusions: Researchers should consider developing behavioral interventions that target exercise self -efficacy and outcome expectations as SCT variables for increasing physical activity in Black persons with MS.

This review aimed to understand the frequency, current uses, and potential barriers with mHealth usage among persons with MS. Methods: A query string was used to identify articles on PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and IEEE Xplore that were published in English between January 2010 and December 2019. Abstracts were reviewed and selected based on a priori inclusion and exclusion criteria. Fifty-nine peer-reviewed research studies related to the study questions are summarized. Results: The majority of persons with MS were reported as using smartphones, although rates of mHealth utilization varied widely. mHealth usage was grouped into 3 broad categories: (1) disability and symptom measurement; (2) interventions and symptom management; and (3) tracking and promoting adherence. While there have been an increasing number of mHealth options, certain limitations associated with MS (eg, poor dexterity, memory problems) may affect usage, although including persons with MS in the design process can address some of these issues. Discussion: Given the increased attention to mHealth in this population and the current need for telehealth and at home devices, it is important that persons with MS and healthcare providers are involved in the development of new mHealth tools to ensure that the end product meets their needs. Considerations for addressing the potential mHealth use barriers in persons with MS are discussed.","[Gromisch, Elizabeth S.; Lo, Albert C.] Trinity Hlth New England, Mandell Ctr Multiple Sclerosis, Mt Sinai Rehabil Hosp, 490 Blue Hills Ave, Hartford, CT 06112 USA; [Gromisch, Elizabeth S.] Quinnipiac Univ, Frank H Netter MD Sch Med, Dept Rehabil Med, North Haven, CT USA; [Gromisch, Elizabeth S.] Quinnipiac Univ, Frank H Netter MD Sch Med, Dept Med Sci, North Haven, CT USA; [Gromisch, Elizabeth S.] Univ Connecticut, Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Farmington, CT USA; [Turner, Aaron P.; Haselkorn, Jodie K.] Vet Affairs, Multiple Sclerosis Ctr Excellence West, Seattle, WA USA; [Turner, Aaron P.; Haselkorn, Jodie K.] VA Puget Sound Hlth Care Syst, Rehabil Care Serv, Seattle, WA USA; [Turner, Aaron P.; Haselkorn, Jodie K.] Univ Washington, Dept Rehabil Med, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Haselkorn, Jodie K.] Univ Washington, Dept Epidemiol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Agresta, Thomas] Univ Connecticut, Hlth Ctr, Dept Family Med, Farmington, CT USA; [Agresta, Thomas] Univ Connecticut, Hlth Ctr, Ctr Quantitat Med, Farmington, CT USA",Quinnipiac University; Quinnipiac University; University of Connecticut; US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); Vet Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Connecticut; University of Connecticut,"Gromisch, ES (corresponding author), Trinity Hlth New England, Mandell Ctr Multiple Sclerosis, Mt Sinai Rehabil Hosp, 490 Blue Hills Ave, Hartford, CT 06112 USA.",elizabeth.gromisch@trinity-healthofne.org,"Turner, Aaron/A-7902-2009","Turner, Aaron/0000-0001-6897-8003",,,,,86,3,3,2,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",,2574-2531,,JAMIA OPEN,JAMIA Open,JUL,2021,4,3,,,,,,,ooaa067,10.1093/jamiaopen/ooaa067,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jamiaopen/ooaa067,,,10,Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,XQ9MI,34514349,gold,,,2023-02-20,WOS:000731864500002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Objectives: This study examined if physical activity levels/sedentary time and vascular comorbidity differed between Black and White persons with MS, and further examined the associations between the variables within the two MS subpopulations. Methods: Participants (n = 208) completed the comorbidity questionnaire in MS and wore accelerometers for seven days as a device-measure of physical activity levels/sedentary time. We examined the effect of race on physical activity levels/sedentary time and vascular comorbidity, controlling for covariates, using ANCOVA. We further performed bivariate correlations among variables in Black and White persons with MS separately. Results: Only moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was significantly different between Black and White persons with MS, even after controlling for age, disease duration, marital status, education level, and income [F(1,177) = 9.01, p = .003, d = 0.16]. There was only a significant and moderate association between MVPA and vascular comorbidity in White persons with MS (r = -0.33). Conclusions: The findings indicate that MVPA is higher in White than Black persons with MS, and that more MVPA was associated with lower vascular comorbidity in White persons with MS.

Forty-six pwMS and 20 healthy controls (HC) were included in the study. They performed the 6MWT with two inertial measurement units (IMUs) placed on the feet. Thirty-two of the pwMS were retested at the end of the stay. PwMS were divided in a mild-disability and a moderate-disability group. The 6MWT was divided in six sections of 1 min each for technical analysis, and linear mixed models were used for statistical analyses. The comparison between the two disability groups and HC highlighted significant differences for each gait parameter (all p < 0.001). The crossing effect between the test-retest and the two disability groups showed greater improvement for the moderate-disability group. Finally, the gait parameter with the higher effect size, allowing the best differentiation between the disability groups, was the foot flat ratio (R-2 = 0.53). Gait analyses from wearable sensors identified different evolutions of gait patterns during the 6MWT in pwMS with different physical disability. The measured effect of a short-time rehabilitation on gait with 6MWT was higher for pwMS with higher degree of disability. Using IMUs in a clinical setting allowed to identify significant changes in inter-stride gait patterns. Wearable sensors and key parameters have the potential as useful clinical tools for focusing on gait in pwMS.","[Berg-Hansen, Pal; Celius, Elisabeth Gulowsen] Oslo Univ Hosp, Dept Neurol, Sognsvannsveien 20, N-0372 Oslo, Norway; [Moen, Stine Marit; Klyve, Thomas Dahl; Negard, Henrik] MS Ctr Hakadal, Hakadal, Norway; [Austeng, Andreas; Meyer, Frederic] Univ Oslo, Dept Informat, Oslo, Norway; [Gonzales, Victor; Seeberg, Trine Margrethe] Smart Sensor Syst, SINTEF Digital, Oslo, Norway; [Celius, Elisabeth Gulowsen] Univ Oslo, Inst Clin Med, Oslo, Norway",University of Oslo; University of Oslo; SINTEF; University of Oslo,"Berg-Hansen, P (corresponding author), Oslo Univ Hosp, Dept Neurol, Sognsvannsveien 20, N-0372 Oslo, Norway.",pal.berg-hansen@ous-research.no,,"Gonzalez Sanchez, Victor Evaristo/0000-0002-4988-2425; Berg-Hansen, Pal/0000-0003-0925-8879",University of Oslo (incl Oslo University Hospital),University of Oslo (incl Oslo University Hospital),Open access funding provided by University of Oslo (incl Oslo University Hospital).,,37,1,1,1,6,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0340-5354,1432-1459,,J NEUROL,J.

Despite the great advances that have occurred in the diagnosis and treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS), few changes have taken place in terms of clinical monitoring. The lack of time and space in clinical practice limits the assessment of invisible symptoms and certain motor symptoms as manual dexterity and walking ability, which have a clear impact on the patient functional situation. Objective. To review the potential role of technological tools in the clinical monitoring of MS patients. Development. A bibliographic search was carried out through PubMed, selecting those studies focused on biosensors and digital tools aimed at evaluating the general functional situation, and specific aspects of the disease or certain functional systems. Results. Different digital tools such as biosensors, mobile or web applications, both for remote and hospital use, self-completed or administered by healthcare personnel, seem to offer a more 'complete and real' picture of the functional situation of patients. Some studies have shown that digital technology could detect subclinical disability progression, which traditional tests, including the EDSS, fail to reflect, favouring the adoption of appropriate therapeutic measures and actions in an early and personalized manner. Conclusions.

Fatigue is among the most common symptoms in MS, resulting in reduced mobility and quality of life. The six-minute walking test (6MWT) is commonly used as a measure of fatigability for the assessment of state fatigue throughout treatment or rehabilitation programs. This 'gold standard' test is time-consuming and can be difficult and exhausting for some patients with high levels of disability or high rates of fatigue.Research question: Can short inertial sensor-based gait tests assess perceived state fatigue in MS patients?Methods: Sixty-five MS patients equipped with one sensor on each foot performed the 6 min walk test (6MWT) and the 25-foot walk (25FW, at both preferred and fastest speed). Perceived state fatigue was measured after each minute of the 6MWT, using the Borg rating. The highest of these ratings served as a measure of overall perceived state fatigue. Stride-wise spatio-temporal gait parameters were extracted from the 25FW and from the first minute, first 2 min, and first 4 min of the 6MWT. Principal component analysis was performed. Perceived state fatigue was predicted in a regression analysis, using the principal components of gait parameters as predictors. Statistical tests evaluated differences in performance between the full 6MWT, the shortened 6MWT, and the 25FW.Results: A mean absolute error of less than 2 points on the Borg rating was obtained using the shortened 6MWT and the 25FW. There were no significant differences between the prediction accuracy of the full 6MWT and that of the shortened gait tests.Significance: It is possible to use shortened gait tests when evaluating perceived state fatigue in MS patients using inertial sensors. Substituting them for long gait tests may reduce the burden of the testing on both patients and clinicians. Further, the approach taken here may prompt future work to explore the use of short bouts of real world walking with unobtrusive inertial sensors for state fatigue assessment.","[Ibrahim, Alzhraa A.; Eskofier, Bjoern M.; Kluge, Felix] Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nurnberg FAU, Machine Learning & Data Analyt Lab, Erlangen, Germany; [Ibrahim, Alzhraa A.] Assiut Univ, Fac Comp & Informat, Comp Sci Dept, Assiut, Egypt; [Flachenecker, Felix; Rothhammer, Veit] Univ Hosp Erlangen, Dept Neurol, Erlangen, Bavaria, Germany; [Gassner, Heiko; Klucken, Jochen] Univ Hosp Erlangen, Dept Mol Neurol, Erlangen, Bavaria, Germany; [Gassner, Heiko; Klucken, Jochen] Fraunhofer Inst Integrated Circuits, Erlangen, Bavaria, Germany; [Klucken, Jochen] Med Valley Digital Hlth Applicat Ctr, Bamberg, Bavaria, Germany",University of Erlangen Nuremberg; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Assiut University; University of Erlangen Nuremberg; University of Erlangen Nuremberg; Fraunhofer Gesellschaft,"Ibrahim, AA (corresponding author), Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nurnberg FAU, Machine Learning & Data Analyt Lab, Erlangen, Germany.",alzhraa.ahmed@fau.de,,"Gassner, Heiko/0000-0003-2037-9460","Medical Faculty, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat (FAU) Erlangen-Nurnberg; Ministry of Higher Education of the Arab Republic of Egypt; IMI Mobilise-D project [820820]; DFG [ES 434/8-1]","Medical Faculty, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat (FAU) Erlangen-Nurnberg; Ministry of Higher Education of the Arab Republic of Egypt(Ministry of Higher Education & Scientific Research (MHESR)); IMI Mobilise-D project; DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG))","This work was supported by the Medical Faculty, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat (FAU) Erlangen-Nurnberg.

Moreover, multiple devastating abnormalities such as multiple sclerosis, cystic fibrosis, hypertension, and many other diseases are associated with single nucleotide variations. Different approaches identify and differentiate single nucleotide substitutions at particular positions of the genome, allowing point-of-care diagnosis, accurate monitoring of drug responses and diseases. However, the health care industry requires more sophisticated and advanced technologies to detect SNPs, hinder disease progression, and revolutionize the drug development process. We show here that advanced biosensor systems can effectively track SNPs, providing a reliable and precise platform for subsequently identifying them. The main goal of this review is focused on novel SNP biosensors, paying special consideration to those based on electrochemical, optical, and piezoelectric analysis. Moreover, the basic principles of advanced biosensors have been mentioned, and future trends in the sensing field are covered in this review.","[Hosseini, Seyed Samad; Jebelli, Asiyeh; Bidar, Negar] Higher Educ Inst Rab Rashid, Fac Basic Sci, Dept Biol Sci, Tabriz, Iran; [Jebelli, Asiyeh] Tabriz Univ Med Sci, TB & Lung Dis Res Ctr, Tabriz, Iran; [Vandghanooni, Somayeh] Tabriz Univ Med Sci, Hematol & Oncol Res Ctr, Tabriz, Iran; [Jahanban-Esfahlan, Ali] Tabriz Univ Med Sci, Kidney Res Ctr, Tabriz, Iran; [Jahanban-Esfahlan, Ali] Tabriz Univ Med Sci, Biotechnol Res Ctr, Tabriz, Iran; [Baradaran, Behzad; Amini, Mohammad; Mokhtarzadeh, Ahad] Tabriz Univ Med Sci, Immunol Res Ctr, Tabriz, Iran; [de la Guardia, Miguel] Univ Valencia, Dept Analyt Chem, Dr Moliner 50, Valencia 46100, Spain; [Eskandani, Morteza] Tabriz Univ Med Sci, Res Ctr Pharmaceut Nanotechnol, Biomed Inst, Tabriz, Iran",Tabriz University of Medical Science; Tabriz University of Medical Science; Tabriz University of Medical Science; Tabriz University of Medical Science; Tabriz University of Medical Science; University of Valencia; Tabriz University of Medical Science,"Mokhtarzadeh, A (corresponding author), Tabriz Univ Med Sci, Immunol Res Ctr, Tabriz, Iran.;Eskandani, M (corresponding author), Tabriz Univ Med Sci, Res Ctr Pharmaceut Nanotechnol, Biomed Inst, Tabriz, Iran.",mokhtarzadehah@tbzmed.ac.ir; eskandanim@tbzmed.ac.ir,"Eskandani, Morteza/P-6209-2016; Jahanban-Esfahlan, Ali/O-5781-2019","Eskandani, Morteza/0000-0003-2282-4871; Jahanban-Esfahlan, Ali/0000-0001-8693-3837; jebelli, asiyeh/0000-0001-9494-2207","Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran","Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran","The Authors are grateful for financial supports from the Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.",,139,2,2,18,22,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND",1385-8947,1873-3212,,CHEM ENG J,Chem.

Technological advances in biomechanics offer opportunities to assess the effects of rehabilitation objectively. Objective: Combining wireless surface electromyography and wearable inertial sensors to assess and monitor the gait pattern before and after an intensive multidisciplinary neurorehabilitation program (44 h/4weeks) to evaluate rehabilitation efficiency. Methods: Forty people with progressive multiple sclerosis were enrolled. Wireless wearable devices were used to evaluate the gait. Instrumental gait analysis, clinical assessment, and patient report outcome measures were acquired before and after the neurorehabilitation. Spatiotemporal gait parameters, the co-activation index of lower limb muscles, and clinical assessments were compared pre- and post-treatment. Results: Significant improvements after intensive neurorehabilitation were found in most of the clinical assessments, cadence, and velocity of the instrumental gait analysis, paralleled by amelioration of thigh co-activation on the less-affected side. Subjects with better balance performance and higher independence at baseline benefit more from the neurorehabilitation course. Conclusions: Significant improvements in gait performance were found in our cohort after an intensive neurorehabilitation course, for both quantitative and qualitative measures. Integrating kinematic and muscle activity measurements offers opportunities to objectively evaluate and interpret treatment effects.","[Huang, Su-Chun; Guerrieri, Simone; Dalla Costa, Gloria; Pisa, Marco; Leocani, Letizia] Ist Sci San Raffaele, Inst Expt Neurol INSPE, Expt Neurophysiol Unit, I-20132 Milan, Italy; [Guerrieri, Simone; Dalla Costa, Gloria; Pisa, Marco; Leccabue, Giulia; Gregoris, Lorenzo; Comi, Giancarlo; Leocani, Letizia] Univ Vita Salute San Raffaele, Fac Med, I-20132 Milan, Italy; [Comi, Giancarlo] Casa Cura Policlin, I-20144 Milan, Italy",Vita-Salute San Raffaele University; IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele; Vita-Salute San Raffaele University,"Leocani, L (corresponding author), Ist Sci San Raffaele, Inst Expt Neurol INSPE, Expt Neurophysiol Unit, I-20132 Milan, Italy.;Leocani, L (corresponding author), Univ Vita Salute San Raffaele, Fac Med, I-20132 Milan, Italy.",huang.suchun@hsr.it; guerrieri.simone@hsr.it; dallacosta.gloria@hsr.it; pisa.marco@hsr.it; giulialeccabue95@gmail.com; gregorislorenzo96@gmail.com; comi.giancarlo@unisr.it; leocani.letizia@hsr.it,,"Huang, Su-Chun/0000-0002-7359-6736; Pisa, Marco/0000-0001-9409-6864",,,,,42,1,1,2,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3425,,BRAIN SCI,Brain Sci.,FEB,2022,12,2,,,,,,,258,10.3390/brainsci12020258,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/brainsci12020258,,,11,Neurosciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Neurosciences & Neurology,ZL5OD,35204021,gold,,,2023-02-20,WOS:000763725400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Purpose Examine the association between device-measured MVPA with optical coherence tomography (OCT) metrics of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness and total macular volume (TMV) in persons with and without MS. Methods Adults with MS (N = 41), along with sex-matched healthy control (HC) participants (N = 79), underwent measurements of retinal morphology via OCT and wore an accelerometer for a period of 7 days as a measure of MVPA. Results Persons with MS had significantly lower MVPA, RNFL thickness, and TMV compared with HCs. MVPA was correlated with RNFL (r = .38, P < .01) thickness and TMV (r = .49, P < .01). Hierarchical linear regression analyses indicated that addition of MVPA attenuated the Group effect on RNFL and TMV. MVPA accounted for 8% and 3% of the variance in TMV (beta = .343, P < .01) and RNFL thickness (beta = .217, P = .03), respectively. Conclusion MVPA was positively associated with axonal and neuronal integrity assessed by OCT and partially explained group differences in those metrics. These results present possible future targets for MS management by increasing MVPA.","[Kim, Jeongwoon; Khan, Naiman A.] Univ Illinois, Dept Kinesiol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Bollaert, Rachel E.] Marquette Univ, Program Exercise Sci, Milwaukee, WI 53233 USA; [Cerna, Jonathan; Khan, Naiman A.] Univ Illinois, Neurosci Program, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Adamson, Brynn C.] Univ Colorado, Dept Hlth Sci, Colorado Springs, CO 80907 USA; [Robbs, Connor M.] Illinois Coll Optometry, Chicago, IL USA; [Khan, Naiman A.] Univ Illinois, Dept Food Sci & Human Nutr, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Motl, Robert W.] Univ Illinois, Dept Kinesiol & Nutr, Chicago, IL USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Marquette University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado at Colorado Springs; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital,"Khan, NA (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Freer Hall,906 S Goodwin Ave,Rm 316, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",nakhan2@illinois.edu,,"Kim, John/0000-0001-7276-5596",University of Illinois Paul D.

Objective: To evaluate fall risk in people with MS. Methods: Ninety-four people with MS, able to walk > 2 min with or without an assistive device (Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS <= 6.5) were recruited. Clinic-based measures were recorded at baseline and 1 year. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs), including a fall survey and the MS Walking Scale (MSWS-12), were completed at baseline, 1.5, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Average daily step counts (STEPS) were recorded using a wrist-worn accelerometer. Results: 50/94 participants (53.2%) reported falling at least once. Only 56% of participants who reported a fall on research questionnaires had medical-record documented falls. Fallers had greater disability [median EDSS 5.5 (IQR 4.0-6.0) versus 2.5 (IQR 1.5-4.0), p < 0.001], were more likely to have progressive MS (p = 0.003), and took fewer STEPS (mean difference - 1,979, p = 0.007) than Non-Fallers. Stepwise regression revealed MSWS-12 as a major predictor of future falls. Conclusions: Falling is common in people with MS, under-reported, and under-ascertained by neurologists in clinic. Multimodal fall screening in clinic and remotely may help improve patient care by identifying those at greatest risk, allowing for timely intervention and referral to specialized physical rehabilitation.","[Block, Valerie J.; Zhao, Chao; Hollenbach, Jill; Bove, Riley; Cree, Bruce A.

With wearable inertial sensors, gait speed can be estimated in an objective manner. However, most of the previous works have validated the gait speed estimation algorithms in clinical settings which can be different than the home assessments in which the patients demonstrate their actual performance. Moreover, to provide comfort for the users, devising an algorithm based on a single sensor setup is essential. To this end, the goal of this study was to develop and validate a new gait speed estimation method based on a machine learning approach to predict gait speed in both clinical and home assessments by a sensor on the lower back. Moreover, two methods were introduced to detect walking bouts during daily activities at home. We have validated the algorithms in 35 patients with multiple sclerosis as it often presents with mobility difficulties. Therefore, the robustness of the algorithm can be shown in an impaired or slow gait. Against silver standard multi-sensor references, we achieved a bias close to zero and a precision of 0.15 m/s for gait speed estimation. Furthermore, the proposed machine learning-based locomotion detection method had a median of 96.8% specificity, 93.0% sensitivity, 96.4% accuracy, and 78.6% F1-score in detecting walking bouts at home.

So far, these decisions have been motivated by conventional outcomes, i.e., relapses or clinical disability supported by radiological disease activity. Complementing this concept, patient reported outcomes (PROs) assess individual health-related quality of life, among other constructs. Their inclusion in clinical routine, however, has been challenging as assessing them requires resources of time and personnel. Objective This interventional feasibility study investigated the haMSter app, a mobile health solution for remote and longitudinal monitoring of PROs in a sample of people with MS (pwMS). Methods The core feature of haMSter is the provision of three PRO questionnaires relevant to MS (anxiety/depression, MS-related quality of life, and fatigue) that patients can fill out once a month. For this feasibility trial, we offered 50 volunteers to use the haMSter app over six months and to take part in a haMSter study visit. This consultation concluded the study and participants had the opportunity to discuss their graphically plotted PRO results with their treating physician. Results The main outcome was overall patient adherence to monthly completion of the PRO questionnaires, which remained high up to 4 months (98%) and dropped over time (months 5: 83% and 6: 66%). Exploratory outcomes included patient satisfaction as estimated on the Telemedicine Perception Questionnaire (TMPQ, 17-85 points). The mean TMPQ score was 64 (95%CI: 62-66) points, indicating a high degree of approval. Ancillary tests included subgroup analyses of participants with particularly high or low satisfaction and upper extremity disability as a potential obstacle to utility or acceptance. We found no distinct characteristics separating participants with high or low satisfaction. Conclusions In this first feasibility trial, the haMSter app for longitudinal PRO monitoring was well received in terms of adherence and satisfaction.

This study examined variables from social cognitive theory (SCT) as correlates of physical activity in older adults with MS as an important first step for informing the design of behavior change interventions. Methods We focused on identifying correlates of light (LPA) and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) based on intensity-dependent benefits of physical activity. Older adults with MS (>= 60 years, N = 441) completed an online survey including demographic and clinical characteristics, SCT variables (self-efficacy, exercise goal setting, social support, and outcome expectations), and physical activity (LPA, MVPA). Results Bivariate correlation analyses indicated that all SCT variables correlated with both LPA and MVPA; however, correlations were stronger in magnitude for MVPA (range r = 0.25-0.56) than for LPA (all r = 0.11-0.20). Conclusion Our results suggest that behavior change interventions informed by SCT may be a promising approach for increasing physical activity, particularly MVPA, in older adults with MS, and this should be a focus of future research in this segment of MS.","[Baird, Jessica F.; Silveira, Stephanie L.; Motl, Robert W.] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Phys Therapy, 1716 9th Ave S, Birmingham, AL 35233 USA; [Baird, Jessica F.; Motl, Robert W.] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Ctr Exercise Med, Birmingham, AL 35233 USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Birmingham; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Birmingham,"Motl, RW (corresponding author), Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Phys Therapy, 1716 9th Ave S, Birmingham, AL 35233 USA.;Motl, RW (corresponding author), Univ Alabama Birmingham, Ctr Exercise Med, Birmingham, AL 35233 USA.",robmotl@uab.edu,,"Silveira, Stephanie/0000-0002-1973-2119",National Institutes of Health Training Grant [2T32HD071866-06]; National Multiple Sclerosis Society Mentor-Based Postdoctoral Fellowship [MB 0029],National Institutes of Health Training Grant(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); National Multiple Sclerosis Society Mentor-Based Postdoctoral Fellowship(National Multiple Sclerosis Society),JFB was supported by a National Institutes of Health Training Grant [2T32HD071866-06] and SLS was supported by the National Multiple Sclerosis Society Mentor-Based Postdoctoral Fellowship [MB 0029].,,44,0,0,1,7,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1824-7490,1825-1234,,SPORT SCI HLTH,Sport Sci.

MicroRNAs (miR) are small, non-coding RNAs that are abnormally expressed in many diseases and have been identified as predictive biomarkers for the early detection of diseases. One of the best diagnostic biomarkers of MS is miR-155. In this report, a sensitive, low-cost, non-label electrochemical nano biosensor was used for miR-155 detection. The biosensor comprises a nanocomposite of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) and polypyrrole (PPY) on the graphite sheet (GS) substrate which was modified with an aptamer as miR-155 capture probe. All electrochemical measurements were performed in the presence of Fe(CN)(6)(3-/4-)as a redox probe. The biosensor has a dynamic range of 10 aM to 1 mu M with a detection limit of 10 aM. Also, the fabricated biosensor was successfully used in human serum. According to the ease of preparation, almost low cost, good selectivity, repeatability, and reproducibility the proposed biosensor can be a promising candidate for early detection of MS.","[Shariati, Sepideh; Ghaffarinejad, Ali] Iran Univ Sci & Technol IUST, Fac Chem, Res Lab Real Samples Anal, Tehran 1684613114, Iran; [Ghaffarinejad, Ali] Iran Univ Sci & Technol IUST, Electroanalyt Chem Res Ctr, Tehran 1684613114, Iran; [Omidinia, Eskandar] Pasteur Inst Iran, Dept Biochem, Genet & Metab Res Grp, Tehran, Iran",Iran University Science & Technology; Iran University Science & Technology; Le Reseau International des Instituts Pasteur (RIIP); Pasteur Institute of Iran,"Ghaffarinejad, A (corresponding author), Iran Univ Sci & Technol IUST, Fac Chem, Res Lab Real Samples Anal, Tehran 1684613114, Iran.;Ghaffarinejad, A (corresponding author), Iran Univ Sci & Technol IUST, Electroanalyt Chem Res Ctr, Tehran 1684613114, Iran.",ghaffarinejad@iust.ac.ir,"Ghaffarinejad, Ali/S-5230-2018",,Research Councils of Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST); Pasteur Institute of Iran,Research Councils of Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST); Pasteur Institute of Iran,We gratefully acknowledge the supporters of this project by the Research Councils of Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST) and Pasteur Institute of Iran.,,25,3,3,3,7,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0026-265X,1095-9149,,MICROCHEM J,Microchem J.,JUL,2022,178,,,,,,,,107358,10.1016/j.microc.2022.107358,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.microc.2022.107358,,MAR 2022,8,"Chemistry, Analytical",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry,1D4AN,,,,,2023-02-20,WOS:000793744900002,View Full Record in Web of Science

A major limitation in fall detection algorithm development is an absence of real-world falls data. Fall detection algorithms are typically trained on simulated fall data that contain a well-balanced number of examples of falls and activities of daily living. However, real-world falls occur infrequently, making them difficult to capture and causing severe data imbalance. People with multiple sclerosis (MS) fall frequently, and their risk of falling increases with disease progression. Because of their high fall incidence, people with MS provide an ideal model for studying falls. This paper describes the development of a context-aware fall detection system based on inertial sensors and time of flight sensors that is robust to imbalance, which is trained and evaluated on real-world falls in people with MS. The algorithm uses an auto-encoder that detects fall candidates using reconstruction error of accelerometer signals followed by a hyper-ensemble of balanced random forests trained using both acceleration and movement features. On a clinical dataset obtained from 25 people with MS monitored over eight weeks during free-living conditions, 54 falls were observed and our system achieved a sensitivity of 92.14%, and false-positive rate of 0.65 false alarms per day.","[Mosquera-Lopez, Clara; Shastry, Mahesh; Folsom, Jonathon; Leitschuh, Joseph; Rajhbeharrysingh, Uma; Jacobs, Peter G.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Portland, OR 97239 USA; [Wan, Eric] Portland State Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Portland, OR 97239 USA; [Condon, John] Prototech Res, Portland, OR USA; [Hildebrand, Andrea; Cameron, Michelle] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Neurol, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Hildebrand, Andrea; Cameron, Michelle] Vet Affairs Portland Hlth Care Syst, Portland, OR 97201 USA",Oregon Health & Science University; Portland State University; Oregon Health & Science University; US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); VA Portland Health Care System,"Mosquera-Lopez, C (corresponding author), Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Portland, OR 97239 USA.",mosquera@ohsu.edu; eric.wan@pdx.edu; mahesh.shastry@gmail.com; folsomj@ohsu.edu; leitschj@ohsu.edu; jcondon11@yahoo.com; rsingh.uma@gmail.com; hildeand@ohsu.edu; cameromi@ohsu.edu; jacobsp@ohsu.edu,"; Jacobs, Peter/I-5236-2014","Cameron, Michelle/0000-0001-7971-4679; Jacobs, Peter/0000-0001-9897-4783; Hildebrand, Andrea/0000-0002-1277-1588","Department of Veterans Affairs, Rehabilitation Research and Development Service [RX001831-01A1]","Department of Veterans Affairs, Rehabilitation Research and Development Service(US Department of Veterans Affairs)","This work was supported by the Department of Veterans Affairs, Rehabilitation Research and Development Service (Award RX001831-01A1).

Given the prevalence and impact of falls, accurate measures of fall frequency are needed. This study compares the sensitivity and false discovery rates of three methods of fall detection: the current gold standard, prospective paper fall calendars, real-time self-reporting and automated detection, the latter two from a novel body-worn device. Methods Falls in twenty-five people with MS were recorded for eight weeks with prospective fall calendars, real-time body-worn self-report, and an automated body-worn detector concurrently. Eligible individuals were adults with MS enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of a fall prevention intervention. Entry criteria were at least two falls or near-falls in the previous two months, Expanded Disability Status Scale = 6.0, community dwelling, and no MS relapse in the previous month. The sensitivity (proportion of true falls detected) and false discovery rates (proportion of false reports generated) of the fall detection methods were compared. A true fall was a fall reported by at least two methods. A false report was a fall reported by only one method. The trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02583386) and is closed. Results In the 1,276 person-days of fall counting with all three methods in use simultaneously there were 1344 unique fall events. Of these, 8.5% (114) were true falls and 91.5% (1230) were false reports. Fall calendars had the lowest sensitivity (0.614) and the lowest false discovery rate (0.067). The automated detector had the highest sensitivity (0.921) and the highest false discovery rate (0.919). All methods generated under one false report per day. There were no fall detection-related adverse events. Conclusion Fall calendars likely underestimate fall frequency by around 40%. The automated detector evaluated here misses very few falls but likely overestimates the number of falls by around one fall per day. Additional research is needed to produce an ideal fall detection and counting method for use in clinical and research applications.","[Hildebrand, Andrea] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, VA Portland Hlth Care Syst, Dept Neurol, 3710 SW US Vet Hosp Rd,Mail Code P3MSCOE, Portland, OR 97239 USA; [Jacobs, Peter G.; Folsom, Jonathon G.; Mosquera-Lopez, Clara] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Pk Rd,Mail Code CH13B, Portland, OR 97239 USA; [Wan, Eric] Portland State Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, 1900 SW 4th Ave, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Cameron, Michelle H.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, VA Portland Hlth Care Syst, Dept Neurol, 3710 SW US Vet Hosp Rd,Mail Code P-3-NEU, Portland, OR 97239 USA",Oregon Health & Science University; US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); VA Portland Health Care System; Oregon Health & Science University; Portland State University; Oregon Health & Science University; US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); VA Portland Health Care System,"Hildebrand, A (corresponding author), Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, VA Portland Hlth Care Syst, Dept Neurol, 3710 SW US Vet Hosp Rd,Mail Code P3MSCOE, Portland, OR 97239 USA.",hildeand@ohsu.edu,,"Cameron, Michelle/0000-0001-7971-4679","United States Department of Veterans Affairs, Rehabilitations Research and Development Service","United States Department of Veterans Affairs, Rehabilitations Research and Development Service(US Department of Veterans Affairs)","Funding United States Department of Veterans Affairs, Rehabilitations Research and Development Service",,63,1,1,0,1,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",2211-0348,2211-0356,,MULT SCLER RELAT DIS,Mult.

Each country launched the survey using online platforms from May to July 2021.Participants: This was an electronic survey study targeting PwMS (N=3725).Intervention: Not applicable.Main Outcome Measures: The survey ascertained physical activity performance and its intensity, the nature of the activities conducted, and the use of technology to support home-based physical activity before and during the pandemic. Results: A total of 3725 respondents completed the survey. Prepandemic, the majority (83%) of respondents reported being physically active, and this decreased to 75% during the pandemic. This change was significant for moderate-and high-intensity activity (P<.0001). Activities carried out in physiotherapy centers, gyms, or pools decreased the most. Walking was the most frequently performed activity prepandemic (27%) and increased during the pandemic (33%). A total of 24% of those inactive during the pandemic had no intention of changing their physical activity behavior post pandemic. A total of 58% of the respondents did not use technology to support physical activity during the pandemic. Of those who did use technology, wearables were most used (24%). Of those currently nonactive (25%) expressed a preference for an in-person format to con-duct physical activity post pandemic.Conclusions: Physical activity performance, especially activities at moderate and high intensities, decreased during the pandemic in PwMS com-pared with prepandemic. Walking and using wearables gained popularity as ways to stay active. As we move toward an endemic COVID-19, a call for action to develop interventions focused on walking programs with specific emphasis on increasing physical activity of PwMS is proposed.

Evaluating symptoms of these conditions is problematic and typically involves repeated visits to a clinic. Remote measurement technology (RMT), consisting of smartphone apps and wearables, may offer a way to improve upon existing methods of managing these conditions. The present study aimed to establish the practical requirements that would enable clinical integration of data from patients' RMT, according to healthcare professionals. Methods This paper reports findings from an online survey of 1006 healthcare professionals currently working in the care of people with epilepsy, MS or depression. The survey included questions on types of data considered useful, how often data should be collected, the value of RMT data, preferred methods of accessing the data, benefits and challenges to RMT implementation, impact of RMT data on clinical practice, and requirement for technical support. The survey was presented on the JISC online surveys platform. Results Among this sample of 1006 healthcare professionals, respondents were positive about the benefits of RMT, with 73.2% indicating their service would be likely or highly likely to benefit from the implementation of RMT in patient care plans. The data from patients' RMT devices should be made available to all nursing and medical team members and could be reviewed between consultations where flagged by the system. However, results suggest it is also likely that RMT data would be reviewed in preparation for and during a consultation with a patient. Time to review information is likely to be one of the greatest barriers to successful implementation of RMT in clinical practice. Conclusions While further work would be required to quantify the benefits of RMT in clinical practice, the findings from this survey suggest that a wide array of clinical team members treating epilepsy, MS and depression would find benefit from RMT data in the care of their patients. Findings presented could inform the implementation of RMT and other digital interventions in the clinical management of a range of neurological and mental health conditions.","[Andrews, J.

These reflect physical and radiological disease activity and are the most relevant endpoints in clinical trials. Over the past few years, the number of studies evaluating so-called patient-reported outcomes (PROs) has been increasing. PROs are reports from patients concerning their own health perception. They are typically obtained by means of questionnaires and aim to quantify symptoms such as fatigue, depression, and sexual dysfunction. The emergence of PROs has made a tremendous contribution to understanding the individual impact of disease in people with MS and their health-related quality of life. However, the assessment of PROs consumes resources, including time and personnel. Thus, useful ways to conveniently introduce PROs into clinical practice are needed. Objective: We aim to provide a rationale and pilot study protocol for a mobile health (mHealth) solution named haMSter that allows for remote monitoring of PROs in people with MS. Methods: The core function of haMSter is to provide three scientifically validated PRO questionnaires relevant to MS for patients to fill out at home once a month. Thereby, longitudinal and remote documentation of PROs is enabled. A scoring algorithm graphically plots PRO scores over time and makes them available at the next visit. Results: The pilot study is currently ongoing and will evaluate adherence to this mHealth solution in 50 patients over a period of 6 months. Results from the haMSter pilot study are expected in 2021. Conclusions: haMSter is a novel mHealth-based solution for modem PRO research, which may constitute the first step in achieving the ability to integrate PROs in clinical practice. This allows for a more problem-oriented approach in monitoring visits, which addresses patient needs and ultimately saves time.","[Altmann, Patrick; Leutmezer, Fritz; Ponleitner, Markus; Monschein, Tobias; Zrzavy, Tobias; Zulehner, Gudrun; Kornek, Barbara; Rommer, Paulus Stefan; Berger, Thomas; Bsteh, Gabriel] Med Univ Vienna, Dept Neurol, Waehringer Guertel 18-20, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Hinterberger, Werner] CAKE Commun, Vienna, Austria; [Lanzenberger, Rupert] Med Univ Vienna, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapy, Vienna, Austria; [Berek, Klaus] Med Univ Innsbruck, Dept Neurol, Innsbruck, Austria",Medical University of Vienna; Medical University of Vienna; Medical University of Innsbruck,"Bsteh, G (corresponding author), Med Univ Vienna, Dept Neurol, Waehringer Guertel 18-20, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",gabriel.bsteh@meduniwien.ac.at,,"Monschein, Tobias/0000-0002-6053-4210; Hinterberger, Werner/0000-0002-6828-8587; Berek, Klaus/0000-0003-2755-2043; Leutmezer, Fritz/0000-0001-5665-8635; Ponleitner, Markus/0000-0002-3709-1845; Lanzenberger, Rupert/0000-0003-4641-9539; Zulehner, Gudrun/0000-0003-4151-684X; kornek, barbara/0000-0002-1851-6967; Zrzavy, Tobias/0000-0001-8909-1591; Altmann, Patrick/0000-0002-2983-3693",,,,,18,2,2,0,1,"JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC",TORONTO,"130 QUEENS QUAY E, STE 1102, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA",1929-0748,,,JMIR RES PROTOC,JMIR RES.

Methods: Adults with multiple sclerosis (MS) taking an oral DMT were randomized 1:1 for 90 days to remote smartphone app-and pill bottle-based (a) adherence monitoring, or (b) adherence monitoring with audiovisual medication reminders. Optimal adherence was defined as the proportion of doses taken +/- 3 h of the scheduled time. Numbers of missed pills and pills taken early, on time, late, and extra were recorded. A multivariable regression model tested possible associations between optimal adherence and age, MS duration, cognitive functioning, and number of daily prescription pills. Results: 85 participants (66 female; mean age 44.9 years) took dimethyl/diroximel fumarate (n = 49), fingolimod (n = 26), or teriflunomide (n = 10). Optimal adherence was on average higher in the monitoring with reminders arm (71.4%) than the monitoring only arm (61.6%; p = 0.033). In a multivariable model, optimal adherence was less likely in younger participants (p < 0.001) and those taking more daily prescription pills (p < 0.001). In the monitoring only arm, 4.0% of doses were taken early, 61.6% on time, 5.6% late, 4.4% in excess, and 24.4% were missed. In the reminders arm, these proportions were 3.4%, 71.4%, 3.7%, 8.7%, and 12.8%, respectively. Conclusion: We map real-world oral DMT adherence patterns using mHealth technology. PwMS who received medication reminders had higher optimal adherence. Nonadherence was more nuanced than simply missing pills. Developing strategies to improve adherence remains important in longitudinal MS care.","[Rice, Dylan R.; Vogel, Andre C.; Matiello, Marcelo; Gillani, Rebecca L.; Hutto, Spencer K.; Klawiter, Eric C.; George, Ilena C.; Mateen, Farrah J.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Neurol, 165 Cambridge St,627, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Kaplan, Tamara B.; Galetta, Kristin] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Neurol, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Kaplan, Tamara B.; Matiello, Marcelo; Gillani, Rebecca L.; Hutto, Spencer K.; Klawiter, Eric C.; George, Ilena C.; Galetta, Kristin; Mateen, Farrah J.] Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Hotan, Gladia C.] Agcy Sci Technol & Res, Inst High Performance Comp, Singapore, Singapore; [Ham, Andrew S.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA USA",Harvard University; Massachusetts General Hospital; Harvard University; Brigham & Women's Hospital; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Agency for Science Technology & Research (A*STAR); A*STAR - Institute of High Performance Computing (IHPC); Harvard University,"Mateen, FJ (corresponding author), Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Neurol, 165 Cambridge St,627, Boston, MA 02114 USA.",fmateen@mgh.harvard.edu,"Hutto, Spencer Kristian/AAT-4037-2021; George, Ilena/J-4789-2019","Hutto, Spencer Kristian/0000-0002-5644-9638; George, Ilena/0000-0001-7863-8539; Hotan, Gladia/0000-0002-6385-9424; Rice, Dylan/0000-0002-0295-1462",National MS Society,National MS Society(National Multiple Sclerosis Society),"This work was supported by a grant from the National MS Society.

Methods Adults with multiple sclerosis were recruited, n = 30 (validation) and n = 57 (test-retest). Steps measured with PiezoRX, Yamax SW200 and ActiGraph GT9X Link (AGlink) and time in different positions measured with AGlink were validated against data from video analysis. Psychometric properties of the Physical Activity and Disability Survey - Revised Swedish version (PADS-R(Sw)) was evaluated. Results The most valid measures were AGlink using the low-frequency extension filter, and PiezoRX with median absolute percentage errors (MeAPEs) of 0.9-3.1% and 1.3-3.3%. The MeAPEs were higher for Yamax SW200 (2.9-21.0%), AGlink display (3.6-44.8%) and AGlink normal filter (8.9-48.9%), indicating low validity. AGlink was not valid in measurements of sitting (MeAPE 12.0-12.5%) or lying (MeAPE 31.0-41.7%). The correlation between PADS-R(Sw) and AGlink steps was r = 0.492 (p = .009). The relative reliability of PADS-R(Sw) was ICC2,1 0.85 (CI 0.76-0.91), and absolute reliability was SEM 0.54. Conclusion AGlink and PiezoRX were valid measures of steps in PwMS.

However, the kinetic and magnitude of adaptation of the internal load and of the core body temperature (CBT) to a submaximal continuous exercise has been poorly addressed in PwMS; this may be relevant for the brief exercise bouts usually occurring in normal daily life. The aim of this work was to evaluate whether multiple sclerosis influences the acute adaptation of the internal load, the CBT and the perceptual load in response to a constant submaximal work step. MethodsCBT has been continuously monitored (0.5 Hz) by a validated wearable heat-flux sensor and electrocardiography was recorded (250 Hz) by a wearable device during a standard 6-minute walk test (6MWT) in 14 PwMS (EDSS, 4.7 +/- 1.2; disease duration: 13.0 +/- 10.2 years; m +/- SD) and 14 age, sex and BMI-matched healthy subjects (HS). The rate of perceived exertion (RPE) of the lower limbs was assessed during the 6MWT by the Borg scale (6-20). ResultsAs expected, PwMS walked a significantly shorter distance (361 +/- 98 m) than the HS group (613 +/- 62 m, p<0.001 vs PwMS). However, the kinetics of adaptation of CBT and the magnitude of CBT change from baseline did not differ between groups. Similarly, heart rate (HR) kinetics and HR change from baseline were comparable between groups during the 6MWT. Finally, lower limbs RPE gradually increased during the exercise test, but without significant differences between groups. ConclusionThe internal load, the metabolic heat production, and the perceptive load due to a standard submaximal walking exercise seems to be preserved in PwMS, suggesting a comparable acute heat production and dissipation during exercise. Therefore, it is unlikely that the different distance achieved during the 6MWT may be caused by altered thermoregulatory responses to exercise. Rather, this appears to be a consequence of the known increased energy cost of locomotion in PwMS.","[Gervasoni, Elisa; Bertoni, Rita; Anastasi, Denise; Rovaris, Marco; Cattaneo, Davide; Merati, Giampiero] IRCCS Fdn Don Gnocchi, Milan, Italy; [Solaro, Claudio; Di Giovanni, Rachele; Grange, Erica] CRRF Mons L Novarese, Rehabil Dept, Moncrivello, Italy; [Gunga, Hanns-Christian; Maggioni, Martina Anna] Charite Univ Med Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Gunga, Hanns-Christian; Maggioni, Martina Anna] Free Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Gunga, Hanns-Christian; Maggioni, Martina Anna] Humboldt Univ, Inst Physiol, Ctr Space Med & Extreme Environm, Berlin, Germany; [Cattaneo, Davide] Univ Milan, Dept Pathophysiol & Transplantat, Milan, Italy; [Maggioni, Martina Anna] Univ Milan, Dept Biomed Sci Hlth SCIBIS, Milan, Italy; [Merati, Giampiero] Univ Insubria, Dept Biotechnol & Life Sci DBSV, Varese, Italy",IRCCS Fondazione Don Carlo Gnocchi Onlus; Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin; Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; University of Milan; University of Milan; University of Insubria,"Anastasi, D (corresponding author), IRCCS Fdn Don Gnocchi, Milan, Italy.",danastasi@dongnocchi.it,"Gervasoni, Elisa/J-1723-2018; Maggioni, Martina Anna/P-1351-2019","Gervasoni, Elisa/0000-0002-6057-591X; Maggioni, Martina Anna/0000-0002-6319-8566","FISM - Fondazione Italiana Sclerosi Multipla [2019/PR-Multi/01, CUP: H39C19000000001]; Ministry of Health (5 per mille)",FISM - Fondazione Italiana Sclerosi Multipla(Fondazione Italiana Sclerosi Multipla (FISM)); Ministry of Health (5 per mille),"This research was supported by FISM - Fondazione Italiana Sclerosi Multipla - cod. 2019/PR-Multi/01, CUP: H39C19000000001 and financed or co-financed by Ministry of Health (5 per mille)",,46,0,0,2,3,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-3224,,,FRONT IMMUNOL,Front.

There are data indicating that the volume of physical activity behavior differs by depression symptom status in MS, yet less is known about the volume of sedentary behavior and its relationship with depression. We further know little about physical activity patterns and sedentary behavior and depression in MS. Objectives: This study examined differences in the volume (i.e., minutes/day) and pattern (i.e., bouts/day or bout length) of device-measured sedentary behavior and physical activity as a function of depression symptom status in persons with MS. Methods: The sample of adults with MS (N=441) completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and wore a waist-mounted ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometer during waking hours for 7 days. Participants were divided into subgroups of elevated (n=127) or non-elevated (n=314) depression symptoms based on a cut-point for the HADS scores (i.e., 8+ as indicative of elevated depressive symptoms). We examined the effect of depression group status differences on volume and pattern of sedentary behavior and light (LPA) and moderateto-vigorous (MVPA) physical activity between subgroups using multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVA) and then multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) controlling for demographic/clinical variables that differed between the elevated and non-elevated depression groups. Results: Results of the MANOVA indicated an overall difference between subgroups in the volume, but not pattern, of physical activity and sedentary behavior. The non-elevated depression group had a significantly greater amount of steps/day (mean [M]=4584.3, standard deviation [SD]=2821.3), than the elevated depression group ([M]=3729.6, [SD]=2576.3, F=8.7; p=.003). Results of the MANCOVA revealed there was no statistically significant difference between the elevated and non-elevated depression groups in measures of volume of physical activity, and the difference in steps/day became non-significant F(1,438)= 2.13, p=.146), after controlling for disability, age, disease duration, and educations years. Conclusions: This study observed no differences in sedentary behavior and physical activity as a function of depression symptom status in persons with MS, yet there was a difference in steps/day initially. Results demonstrated that when disability, age, disease duration, and years of education are included in the MANCOVA, the difference in depression groups is no longer significant. This suggests that steps/day could be an important target of health promotion interventions among persons with MS who have higher disability and elevated depression symptoms.","[Jones, C.

Therefore, monitoring of ambulatory function is of great importance to be able to effectively counteract disease progression. An extensive gait analysis, such as the Dresden protocol for multidimensional walking assessment, covers several facets of walking impairment including a 2-min walk test, in which the distance taken by the patient in two minutes is measured by an odometer. Using this approach, it is questionable how precise the measuring methods are at recording the distance traveled. In this project, we investigate whether the current measurement can be replaced by a digital measurement method based on accelerometers (six Opal sensors from the Mobility Lab system) that are attached to the patient's body. We developed two algorithms using these data and compared the validity of these approaches using the results from 2-min walk tests from 562 pwMS that were collected with a gold-standard odometer. In 48.4% of pwMS, we detected an average relative measurement error of less than 5%, while results from 25.8% of the pwMS showed a relative measurement error of up to 10%. The algorithm had difficulties correctly calculating the walking distances in another 25.8% of pwMS; these results showed a measurement error of more than 20%. A main reason for this moderate performance was the variety of pathologically altered gait patterns in pwMS that may complicate the step detection. Overall, both algorithms achieved favorable levels of agreement (r = 0.884 and r = 0.980) with the odometer. Finally, we present suggestions for improvement of the measurement system to be implemented in the future.","[Trentzsch, Katrin; Melzer, Benjamin; Stoelzer-Hutsch, Heidi; Haase, Rocco; Bartscht, Paul; Meyer, Paul; Ziemssen, Tjalf] Tech Univ Dresden, Univ Hosp Carl Gustav Carus, Ctr Clin Neurosci, Neurol Clin, Fetscher Str 74, D-01307 Dresden, Germany; [Melzer, Benjamin; Meyer, Paul] Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Bio Med Engn, Fetscher Str 29, D-01307 Dresden, Germany",Technische Universitat Dresden; Carl Gustav Carus University Hospital; Technische Universitat Dresden,"Ziemssen, T (corresponding author), Tech Univ Dresden, Univ Hosp Carl Gustav Carus, Ctr Clin Neurosci, Neurol Clin, Fetscher Str 74, D-01307 Dresden, Germany.",katrin.trentzsch@uniklinikum-dresden.de; benjamin.melzer@outlook.com; Heidi.Stoelzer-Hutsch@uniklinikum-dresden.de; Rocco.Haase@uniklinikum-dresden.de; paul@bartscht.name; paul.meyer.15@web.de; Tjalf.Ziemssen@uniklinikum-dresden.de,,"Haase, Rocco/0000-0003-2465-4909; Ziemssen, Tjalf/0000-0001-8799-8202; Trentzsch, Katrin/0000-0003-2832-4640; Stolzer-Hutsch, Heidi/0000-0002-1656-501X",,,,,51,2,2,1,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3425,,BRAIN SCI,Brain Sci.,NOV,2021,11,11,,,,,,,1507,10.3390/brainsci11111507,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/brainsci11111507,,,15,Neurosciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Neurosciences & Neurology,XK8OM,34827506,gold,,,2023-02-20,WOS:000727717700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Remote monitoring using average daily step count (STEPS) can assess physical activity (activity) and disability in MS. STEPS correlates with conventional metrics such as the expanded disability status scale (Expanded Disability Status Scale; EDSS), Timed-25 Foot walk (T25FW) and timed up and go (TUG). However, while STEPS as a summative measure characterizes the number of steps taken over a day, it does not reflect variability and intensity of activity. ObjectivesNovel analytical methods were developed to describe how individuals spends time in various activity levels (e.g., continuous low versus short bouts of high) and the proportion of time spent at each activity level. Methods94 people with MS spanning the range of ambulatory impairment (unaffected to requiring bilateral assistance) were recruited into FITriMS study and asked to wear a Fitbit continuously for 1-year. Parametric distributions were fit to minute-by-minute step data. Adjusted R-2 values for regressions between distributional fit parameters and STEPS with EDSS, TUG, T25FW and the patient-reported 12-item MS Walking scale (MSWS-12) were calculated over the first 4-weeks, adjusting for sex, age and disease duration. ResultsDistributional fits determined that the best statistically-valid model across all subjects was a 3-compartment Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) that characterizes the step behavior within 3 levels of activity: high, moderate and low. The correlation of GMM parameters for baseline step count measures with clinical assessments was improved when compared with STEPS (adjusted R-2 values GMM vs. STEPS: TUG: 0.536 vs. 0.419, T25FW: 0.489 vs. 0.402, MSWS-12: 0.383 vs. 0.378, EDSS: 0.557 vs. 0.465). The GMM correlated more strongly (Kruskal-Wallis: p = 0.0001) than STEPS and gave further information not included in STEPS. ConclusionsIndividuals' step distributions follow a 3-compartment GMM that better correlates with clinic-based performance measures compared with STEPS. These data support the existence of high-moderate-low levels of activity. GMM provides an interpretable framework to better understand the association between different levels of activity and clinical metrics and allows further analysis of walking behavior that takes step distribution and proportion of time at three levels of intensity into account.","[Block, Valerie J.; Waliman, Matthew; Xie, Zhendong; Akula, Amit; Bove, Riley; Cree, Bruce A.

This creates a novel situation in which health care providers and patients must engage in a reconfiguration of roles and responsibilities. Although existing research pays considerable attention to the perceptions of patients regarding digital self-monitoring, less attention has been paid to the needs, wishes, and concerns of health care providers. As several companies and public institutions are developing and testing digital self-monitoring at the time of writing, it is timely and relevant to explore how health care providers envision using these technologies in their daily work practices. Our findings can be considered in decision-making processes concerning the further development and implementation of digital self-monitoring. Objective: This study aims to explore how health care providers envisage using smartphone apps for digital self-monitoring of multiple sclerosis (MS) in their daily work practices, with a particular focus on physician-patient communication and on how health care providers respond to self-monitoring data and delegate tasks and responsibilities to patients. Methods: We conducted semistructured in-depth interviews with 14 MS health care providers: 4 neurologists, 7 MS specialist nurses, and 3 rehabilitation professionals. They are affiliated with 3 different hospitals in the Netherlands that will participate in a pilot study to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of a specific smartphone app for self-monitoring. Results: The interviewed health care providers seemed willing to use these smartphone apps and valued the quantitative data they produce that can complement the narratives that patients provide during medical appointments. The health care providers primarily want to use digital self-monitoring via prescription, meaning that they want a standardized smartphone app and want to act as its gatekeepers. Furthermore, they envisioned delegating particular tasks and responsibilities to patients via digital self-monitoring, such as sharing data with the health care providers or acting on the data, if necessary. The health care providers expected patients to become more proactive in the management of their disease. However, they also acknowledged that not all patients are willing or able to use digital self-monitoring apps and were concerned about the potential psychological and emotional Conclusions: Our findings show that health care providers envisage a particular type of patient empowerment and personalized health care in which tensions arise between health care providers acting as gatekeepers and patient autonomy, between patient empowerment and patient disempowerment, and between the weight given to quantitative objective data and that given to patients??? subjective experiences. In future research, it would be very interesting to investigate the actual experiences of health care providers with regard to digital self-monitoring to ascertain how the tensions mentioned in this paper play out in practice.","[Wendrich, Karine; Krabbenborg, Lotte] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Sci Soc, Heyendaalseweg 135, NL-6525 AJ Nijmegen, Netherlands",Radboud University Nijmegen,"Krabbenborg, L (corresponding author), Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Sci Soc, Heyendaalseweg 135, NL-6525 AJ Nijmegen, Netherlands.",Lotte.Krabbenborg@ru.nl,,"Krabbenborg, Lotte/0000-0002-4279-6700; Wendrich, Karine/0000-0001-9413-1674",Dutch National MS Foundation; Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research [628.011.025],Dutch National MS Foundation; Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),This work received financial support from the Dutch National MS Foundation and the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (Data2Person Project 628.011.025).

While clinical presentations of MS are highly heterogeneous, mobility limitations are one of the most frequent symptoms. This study examines a machine learning (ML) framework for identifying MS through spatiotemporal and kinetic gait features. Methods: In this study, gait data during self-paced walking on an instrumented treadmill from 20 persons with MS and 20 age, weight, height, and gender-matched healthy older adults (HOA) were obtained. We explored two strategies to normalize data and minimize dependence on subject demographics; size-normalization (standard body size-based normalization) and regress-normalization (regression-based normalization using scaling factors derived by regressing gait features on multiple subject demographics); and proposed an ML based methodology to classify individual strides of older persons with MS (PwMS) from healthy controls. We generalized both across different walking tasks and subjects. Results: We observed that regress-normalization improved the accuracy of identifying pathological gait using ML when compared to size-normalization. When generalizing from comfortable walking to walking while talking, gradient boosting machine achieved the optimal subject classification accuracy and AUG of 94.3 and 1.0, respectively and for subject generalization, a multilayer perceptron resulted in the best accuracy and AUC of 80% and 0.86, respectively, both with regression-normalized data. Conclusion: The integration of gait data and ML may provide a viable patient-centric approach to aid clinicians in monitoring MS. Significance: The results of this study have future implications for the way regression normalized gait features may be clinically used to design ML-based disease prediction strategies and monitor disease progression in PwMS.","[Kaur, Rachneet] Univ Illinois, Dept Ind & Enterprise Syst Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Chen, Zizhang] Univ Illinois, Dept Math, Dept Stat, Urbana, IL USA; [Motl, Robert] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Phys Therapy, Birmingham, AL USA; [Hernandez, Manuel E.] Univ Illinois, Dept Kinesiol & Community Hlth, Urbana, IL USA; [Sowers, Richard] Univ Illinois, Dept Ind & Enterprise Syst Engn, Dept Math, Urbana, IL USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Birmingham; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Kaur, R (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Ind & Enterprise Syst Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",rk4@illinois.edu,"Kaur, Rachneet/AAY-8140-2021","Kaur, Rachneet/0000-0002-9223-4546",University of Illinois Center for Wearable Intelligent Technologies SRI [15674],University of Illinois Center for Wearable Intelligent Technologies SRI,This work was supported in part by the University of Illinois Center for Wearable Intelligent Technologies SRI.

MS affects nearly 1 million people in the United States, with significant negative impact on a patient's quality of life, and an average lifetime cost of care in excess of $4 million. The cost-effective management of patients with MS faces several challenges. OBJECTIVES: To review the challenges to the cost-effective management of patients with MS, and to offer healthcare stakeholders a roadmap to address them. DISCUSSION: The cost-effective management of patients with MS, which is driven largely by how quickly a patient receives effective medication therapy, is challenged by a paucity of between office-visit clinical data, variability of provider expertise with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), MRI machine quality, lack of standards for MRI machines and reports, misaligned financial incentives, the limited number of available Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes for brain MRI, the complexity of disease-modifying therapy (DMT) selection, poor patient adherence to treatment plans, poor communication among providers, and a lack of objective measures of disease progression. CONCLUSION: Insurers, neurologists, researchers, and patient advocacy groups must address the needs of patients with MS holistically. These efforts should include establishing standards for MRI machines and reports, matching patients with MS specialists, aligning financial incentives, including creating a new CPT code for complex brain MRI, streamlining prior authorization processes of DMTs, using technology to gather patient data and improve coordination of care, and developing better measurement tools of disease activity.","[Weinstein, David R.] Extropy Hlth Solut, Danville, CA 94506 USA; [Owens, Gary M.] Gary Owens Associates, Ocean View, DE USA; [Gandhi, Ankit] NIH, Bldg 10, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA",National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA,"Weinstein, DR (corresponding author), Extropy Hlth Solut, Danville, CA 94506 USA.",,,,"Octave Bioscience, Inc.","Octave Bioscience, Inc.","Funding for this article was provided by Octave Bioscience, Inc.",,44,0,0,1,2,ENGAGE HEALTHCARE COMMUNICATIONS INC,HIGHLAND PARK,"318 CLEVELAND AVE, HIGHLAND PARK, NJ 08904 USA",1942-2962,1942-2970,,AM HEALTH DRUG BENEF,Am.

Due to the lack of specific assays for this disease, the development of a point-of-care test for rapid detection of MS could lead to avoiding diagnostics delays. In this paper, we report the first electrochemical immunoplatform for quantification of the CCL5 biomarker at the clinically required levels, able to discriminate between patients diagnosed with MS and healthy individuals. The immunosensing device involves protein capture from biological samples by complexation with biotinylated specific antibodies immobilized onto neutravidin-functionalized microparticles and sandwich assay with anti-CCL5 antibody and IgG labelled with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) for the enzyme-catalyzed amperometric detection of H2O2 using hydroquinone (HQ) as the redox mediator. The method shows excellent analytical performance for clinical application with a wide linear range of concentrations (0.1-300 ng.mL(-1) CCL5, R-2 = 0.998) and a low detection limit (40 pg.mL(-1) CCL5). The biosensing platform was applied to the determination of the CCL5 endogenous content in 100-fold diluted sera both from healthy individuals and patients diagnosed with MS, with no further sample treatment in just two hours. The results were successfully compared with those obtained by the ELISA methodology.","[Guerrero, Sara; Sanchez-Tirado, Esther; Agui, Lourdes; Gonzalez-Cortes, Araceli; Yanez-Sedeno, Paloma; Pingarron, Jose M.] Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac Chem, Dept Analyt Chem, Madrid 28040, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid,"Gonzalez-Cortes, A; Yanez-Sedeno, P (corresponding author), Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac Chem, Dept Analyt Chem, Madrid 28040, Spain.",aracelig@ucm.es; yseo@quim.ucm.es,"Gonzalez-Cortes, Araceli/H-4267-2015; SANCHEZ-TIRADO, ESTHER/G-5759-2016","Gonzalez-Cortes, Araceli/0000-0001-9054-9993; Pingarron, Jose/0000-0003-2271-1383; SANCHEZ-TIRADO, ESTHER/0000-0002-2386-4552; Yanez-Sedeno, Paloma/0000-0002-1232-2723","Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades [RTI2018-096135-B-I00]; TRANSNANOAVANSENS-CM Program from the Comunidad de Madrid [S2018/NMT-4349]","Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades(Spanish Government); TRANSNANOAVANSENS-CM Program from the Comunidad de Madrid","The financial support of RTI2018-096135-B-I00 (Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades), and the TRANSNANOAVANSENS-CM Program from the Comunidad de Madrid (Grant S2018/NMT-4349) is gratefully acknowledged.",,31,0,0,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2079-6374,,BIOSENSORS-BASEL,Biosensors-Basel,AUG,2022,12,8,,,,,,,610,10.3390/bios12080610,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/bios12080610,,,15,"Chemistry, Analytical; Nanoscience & Nanotechnology; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Instruments & Instrumentation,4D1ZN,36005006,gold,,,2023-02-20,WOS:000846946500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Data supporting the minimal duration of sensor wear, which is necessary to capture representative variability in impairment measures, are needed to balance patient burden, data quality, and study cost. Prior investigations have examined the duration required for resolving a variety of movement variables (e.g., gait speed, sit-to-stand tests), but these studies use differing methodologies and have only examined a small subset of potential measures of gait and balance impairment. Notably, postural sway measures have not yet been considered in these analyses. Here, we propose a three-level framework for examining this problem. Difference testing and intra-class correlations (ICC) are used to examine the agreement in features computed from potential wear durations (levels one and two). The association between features and established patient reported outcomes at each wear duration is also considered (level three) for determining the necessary wear duration. Utilizing wearable accelerometer data continuously collected from 22 persons with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) for 6 weeks, this framework suggests that 2 to 3 days of monitoring may be sufficient to capture most of the variability in gait and sway; however, longer periods (e.g., 3 to 6 days) may be needed to establish strong correlations to patient-reported clinical measures. Regression analysis indicates that the required wear duration depends on both the observation frequency and variability of the measure being considered. This approach provides a framework for evaluating wear duration as one aspect of the comprehensive assessment, which is necessary to ensure that wearable sensor-based methods for capturing gait and balance impairment in the free-living environment are fit for purpose.","[Meyer, Brett M.; Donahue, Nicole; Fox, Samantha R.; O'Leary, Aisling; Loftness, Bryn C.; Cheney, Nick; McGinnis, Ryan S.] Univ Vermont, M Sense Res Grp, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Depetrillo, Paolo; Franco, Jaime; Buckley, Maura; Ng, Sau Kuen; Ceruolo, Melissa] A Dassault Syst Co, Medidata Solut2, New York, NY 10014 USA; [Gurchiek, Reed D.] Stanford Univ, Dept Bioengn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Solomon, Andrew J.] Univ Vermont, Dept Neurol Sci, Burlington, VT 05405 USA",University of Vermont; Stanford University; University of Vermont,"McGinnis, RS (corresponding author), Univ Vermont, M Sense Res Grp, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.",ryan.mcginnis@uvm.edu,,"McGinnis, Ryan/0000-0001-8396-6967; Loftness, Bryn/0000-0003-4597-0783; Meyer, Brett/0000-0002-3313-1555",United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) [EB027852],United States National Institutes of Health (NIH)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA),This research was funded by the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) (Grant No. EB027852).,,51,0,0,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,SEP,2022,22,18,,,,,,,6982,10.3390/s22186982,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s22186982,,,16,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,4R3TQ,36146348,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-02-20,WOS:000856691000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Quantifying these mobility patterns could support diagnosing, tracking disease progression and measuring response to treatment. This quantification can be done with wearable technology, such as inertial measurement units (IMUs). Before IMUs can be used to quantify mobility, algorithms need to be developed and validated with age and disease-specific datasets. This study proposes a protocol for a dataset that can be used to develop and validate IMU-based mobility algorithms for healthy adults (18-60 years), healthy older adults (>60 years), and patients with Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, a symptomatic stroke and chronic low back pain. All participants will be measured simultaneously with IMUs and a 3D optical motion capture system while performing standardized mobility tasks and non-standardized activities of daily living. Specific clinical scales and questionnaires will be collected. This study aims at building the largest dataset for the development and validation of IMU-based mobility algorithms for healthy adults and neurological patients. It is anticipated to provide this dataset for further research use and collaboration, with the ultimate goal to bring IMU-based mobility algorithms as quickly as possible into clinical trials and clinical routine.","[Warmerdam, Elke; Romijnders, Robbin; Geritz, Johanna; Elshehabi, Morad; Maetzler, Corina; Otto, Jan Carl; Reimer, Maren; Stuerner, Klarissa; Baron, Ralf; Paschen, Steffen; Beyer, Thorben; Dopcke, Denise; Eiken, Tobias; Ortmann, Hendrik; Peters, Falko; von der Recke, Felix; Riesen, Moritz; Rohwedder, Gothia; Schaade, Anna; Schumacher, Maike; Sondermann, Anton; Maetzler, Walter; Hansen, Clint] Univ Kiel, Dept Neurol, Arnold Heller Str 3, D-24105 Kiel, Germany",University of Kiel,"Warmerdam, E (corresponding author), Univ Kiel, Dept Neurol, Arnold Heller Str 3, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.",e.warmerdam@neurologie.uni-kiel.de; r.romllnders@neurologie.uni-kiel.de; j.geritz@neurologie.uni-kiel.de; m.elshehabi@neurologie.uni-kiel.de; c.maetzler@neurologie.uni-kiel.de; jc.otto@gmx.net; maren.reimer@uksh.de; klarissa.stuerner@uksh.de; r.baron@neurologie.uni-kiel.de; s.paschen@neurologie.uni-kiel.de; thorben.beyer@uksh.de; denise.dopcke@uksh.de; tobias.eiken@uksh.de; janhendrik.ortmann@uksh.de; falko300@t-online.de; felix.vdr@gmx.de; moritz.riesen@uksh.de; gothia.rohwedder@uksh.de; anna.schaade@uksh.de; maike.schumacher@uksh.de; antonsondermann@yahoo.de; w.maetzler@neurologie.uni-kiel.de; c.hansen@neurologie.uni-kiel.de,"Hansen, Clint/J-4961-2019; Elshehabi, Morad/HDN-7412-2022","Hansen, Clint/0000-0003-4813-3868; Warmerdam, Elke/0000-0002-2343-7761; Paschen, Steffen/0000-0002-9306-8332",DFG Open Access fund,DFG Open Access fund,This research received funding from the DFG Open Access fund.,,60,7,7,3,14,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,SEP,2021,21,17,,,,,,,5833,10.3390/s21175833,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s21175833,,,13,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,UO2KL,34502726,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-02-20,WOS:000694528500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Objective: To evaluate inter-rater variability and errors in EDSS and FP rating in junior (JN) and MS Neurologists (MSN). Method: Patients with MS were examined by a JN and a MSN on the same day. Each assessor rated FP and EDSS, then used a smartphone app to get an automated calculation for each FP (smartphone FP, sFP) and for EDSS (smartphone EDSS, sEDSS) from the description of the neurological exam. Inter-rater variability was assessed comparing JN and MSN ratings for each method. Intra-rater variability was assessed comparing traditional and digital rating for a given assessor. Result: 103 patients were included. Perfect agreement between JN and MSN was met for 67% and 70% of patients regarding EDSS and sEDSS. Disagreement that could lead to a significant difference in terms of level of disability occurred in 17% for EDSS and 12% for sEDSS (p=0.07). Regarding intra-rater reliability, we found 38 rating discrepancies for JN and 14 for MSN (p=0.04). Conclusion: We found a significant inter-rater variability as well as a substantial frequency of rating errors in JN. The use of less subjective, easier-to-rate scales should be encouraged.","[Cohen, Mikael; Bresch, Saskia; Rocchi, Oceane Thommel; Morain, Emmanuel; Benoit, Jeanne; Levraut, Michael; Fakir, Salim; Landes, Cassandre; Lebrun-Frenay, Christine] Hop Pasteur 2 Neurol, URRIS, UR2CA CRCSEP, Unite Rech Clin Cote dAzur, 30 Voie Romaine, F-06002 Nice, France",,"Cohen, M (corresponding author), Hop Pasteur 2 Neurol, URRIS, UR2CA CRCSEP, Unite Rech Clin Cote dAzur, 30 Voie Romaine, F-06002 Nice, France.",cohen.m@chu-nice.fr,"BENOIT, Jeanne/GZA-9996-2022; Levraut, Michael/GSD-3542-2022","Benoit, Jeanne/0000-0002-3781-8442",Department of Clinical Research and Innovation of the Nice University Hospital,Department of Clinical Research and Innovation of the Nice University Hospital,"The authors acknowledge the Department of Clinical Research and Innovation of the Nice University Hospital (Dr Eric Fontas, Mrs Coralie Cruzel) for supporting in study design and statistical analysis",,8,3,3,0,0,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",2211-0348,2211-0356,,MULT SCLER RELAT DIS,Mult.

Method Database search through PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL, and SportDiscuss was conducted to retrieve studies that explored the use of smartphone-based applications for assessing gait and balance disorders in SS. Two independent reviewers screened potential articles to determine eligibility for inclusion. Eligible studies were summarized for participant and study characteristics, validity, reliability, sensitivity, and specificity of smartphone assessments. Methodological quality assessment of studies was performed using the NIH Quality Assessment Tool. Results Seven cross-sectional studies were included in the review. Quality assessment revealed all studies had low risk of bias. Three of the included studies examined the validity, four examined the reliability, and two examined the specificity and sensitivity of smartphone-based application assessments of gait and balance in SS. Studies revealed that smartphones were valid, reliable, specific, and sensitive. Six of the seven included studies intended their use for SS and one study for clinicians. Conclusion Preliminary evidence supports that smartphone-based gait and balance assessments are valid, reliable, sensitive, and specific in SS in laboratory settings.

However, single variable weights have not yet been adequately assessed. Hence, the aim of this pilot randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the tDCS effects on balance and gait in patients with MS through a machine learning approach. In this pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT), we included people with relapsing-remitting MS and an Expanded Disability Status Scale >1 and <5 that were randomly allocated to two groups-a study group, undergoing a 10-session anodal motor cortex tDCS, and a control group, undergoing a sham treatment. Both groups underwent a specific balance and gait rehabilitative program. We assessed as outcome measures the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Fall Risk Index and timed up-and-go and 6-min-walking tests at baseline (T0), the end of intervention (T1) and 4 (T2) and 6 weeks after the intervention (T3) with an inertial motion unit. At each time point, we performed a multiple factor analysis through a machine learning approach to allow the analysis of the influence of the balance and gait variables, grouping the participants based on the results. Seventeen MS patients (aged 40.6 +/- 14.4 years), 9 in the study group and 8 in the sham group, were included. We reported a significant repeated measures difference between groups for distances covered (6MWT (meters), p < 0.03). At T1, we showed a significant increase in distance (m) with a mean difference (MD) of 37.0 [-59.0, 17.0] (p = 0.003), and in BBS with a MD of 2.0 [-4.0, 3.0] (p = 0.03). At T2, these improvements did not seem to be significantly maintained; however, considering the machine learning analysis, the Silhouette Index of 0.34, with a low cluster overlap trend, confirmed the possible short-term effects (T2), even at 6 weeks. Therefore, this pilot RCT showed that tDCS may provide non-sustained improvements in gait and balance in MS patients. In this scenario, machine learning could suggest evidence of prolonged beneficial effects.","[Marotta, Nicola; de Sire, Alessandro; Marinaro, Cinzia; Moggio, Lucrezia; Inzitari, Maria Teresa; Russo, Ilaria; Tasselli, Anna; Ammendolia, Antonio] Univ Catanzaro Magna Graecia, Dept Med & Surg Sci, Via Tommaso Campanella 115, I-88100 Catanzaro, Italy; [Paolucci, Teresa] Univ Gabriele DAnnunzio Chieti, Phys Med & Rehabil, Dept Oral Med & Biotechnol Sci, I-66100 Chieti, Italy; [Valentino, Paola] Univ Catanzaro Magna Graecia, Inst Neurol, Viale Europa, I-88100 Catanzaro, Italy",Magna Graecia University of Catanzaro; G d'Annunzio University of Chieti-Pescara; Magna Graecia University of Catanzaro,"de Sire, A (corresponding author), Univ Catanzaro Magna Graecia, Dept Med & Surg Sci, Via Tommaso Campanella 115, I-88100 Catanzaro, Italy.",nicola.marotta@unicz.it; alessandro.desire@unicz.it; cinziamarinaro83@gmail.com; lucrezia.moggio@gmail.com; inzitari@unicz.it; ilaria.russo003@gmail.com; annatasselli@gmail.com; teresa.paolucci@unich.it; p.vale@unicz.it; ammendolia@unicz.it,"Marotta, Nicola/AAM-6163-2020; Ammendolia, Antonio/K-2155-2016","Marotta, Nicola/0000-0002-5568-7909; Ammendolia, Antonio/0000-0002-2828-2455; Inzitari, Maria Teresa/0000-0002-1456-3221; de Sire, Alessandro/0000-0002-5541-8346; Moggio, Lucrezia/0000-0002-3791-4047",,,,,93,3,3,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-0383,,J CLIN MED,J.

However, adherence is low, especially over long periods. If people are to benefit from these resources, we need a better long-term understanding of what influences patient engagement. Previous research suggests that engagement is moderated by several barriers and facilitators, but their relative importance is unknown. Objective: To determine preferences and the relative importance of user-generated factors influencing engagement with mHealth technologies for 2 common neurological conditions with a relapsing-remitting course: multiple sclerosis (MS) and epilepsy. Methods: In a discrete choice experiment, people with a diagnosis of MS (n=141) or epilepsy (n=175) were asked to select their preferred technology from a series of 8 vignettes with 4 characteristics: privacy, clinical support, established benefit, and device accuracy; each of these characteristics was greater or lower in each vignette. These characteristics had previously been emphasized by people with MS and or epilepsy as influencing engagement with technology. Mixed multinomial logistic regression models were used to establish which characteristics were most likely to affect engagement. Subgroup analyses explored the effects of demographic factors (such as age, gender, and education), acceptance of and familiarity with mobile technology, neurological diagnosis (MS or epilepsy), and symptoms that could influence motivation (such as depression). Results: Analysis of the responses to the discrete choice experiment validated previous qualitative findings that a higher level of privacy, greater clinical support, increased perceived benefit, and better device accuracy are important to people with a neurological condition. Accuracy was perceived as the most important factor, followed by privacy. Clinical support was the least valued of the attributes. People were prepared to trade a modest amount of accuracy to achieve an improvement in privacy, but less likely to make this compromise for other factors. The type of neurological condition (epilepsy or MS) did not influence these preferences, nor did the age, gender, or mental health status of the participants. Those who were less accepting of technology were the most concerned about privacy and those with a lower level of education were prepared to trade accuracy for more clinical support. Conclusions: For people with neurological conditions such as epilepsy and MS, accuracy (ie, the ability to detect symptoms) is of the greatest interest. However, there are individual differences, and people who are less accepting of technology may need far greater reassurance about data privacy. People with lower levels of education value greater clinician involvement. These patient preferences should be considered when designing mHealth technologies.","[Simblett, Sara; Pennington, Mark; Novak, Jan; Dawe-Lane, Erin; Morris, Daniel; Mutepua, Magano; Odoi, Clarissa; Wilson, Emma; Wykes, Til] Kings Coll London, Psychol Dept, 16 De Crespigny Pk, London SE5 8AF, England; [Quaife, Matthew] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Hlth Econ Dept, London, England; [Theochari, Evangelia] Kings Coll Hosp London, Neurosci Dept, London, England; [Burke, Patrick; Brichetto, Giampaolo; Devonshire, Julie; Lees, Simon; Little, Ann; Pullen, Angie; Stoneman, Amanda; Thorpe, Sarah; Weyer, Janice] Kings Coll London, Remote Assessment Dis & Relapse Cent Nervous Syst, London, England; [Brichetto, Giampaolo] Italian Multiple Sclerosis Soc & Fdn, Rome, Italy; [Little, Ann] Int Bur Epilepsy, Dublin, Ireland; [Pullen, Angie; Stoneman, Amanda] Epilepsy Act, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Polhemus, Ashley; Novak, Jan] Merck Sharp & Dohme Informat Technol, Prague, Czech Republic; [Novak, Jan] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Prague, Czech Republic; [Odoi, Clarissa] South London & Maudsley Biomed Res Ctr, London, England",University of London; King's College London; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust; King's College Hospital; University of London; King's College London; Charles University Prague,"Simblett, S (corresponding author), Kings Coll London, Psychol Dept, 16 De Crespigny Pk, London SE5 8AF, England.",sara.simblett@kcl.ac.uk,,"Burke, Patrick/0000-0003-2547-6374; Quaife, Matthew/0000-0001-9291-1511; Dawe Lane, Erin/0000-0002-8479-6696; Pullen, Angie/0000-0001-6735-8953; Little, Ann/0000-0002-9587-8507; Odoi, Clarissa M./0000-0002-6132-9307; Polhemus, Ashley/0000-0002-5056-5785; Wilson, Emma/0000-0003-4413-8338",Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 Joint Undertaking [115902]; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program; European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations; National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre at South London; Maudsley National Health Service Foundation Trust; King's College London; National Institute for Health Research,Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 Joint Undertaking; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program; European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations; National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre at South London; Maudsley National Health Service Foundation Trust; King's College London(General Electric); National Institute for Health Research(National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)),"This paper was written as part of the development of useful mHealth and remote measurement technology systems in the Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse in Central Nervous System Disorders (RADAR-CNS) project.

The developed configuration involves the use of carboxylated magnetic microparticles (cMBs) where the protein for specific capture of the target autoantibodies was covalently attached. The immobilized anti-MBP were further conjugated with a secondary antibody labelled with horseradish peroxidase (HRP-anti-hIgG) and amperometric transduction was performed by adding hydrogen peroxide and using hydroquinone (HQ) as redox mediator. The cathodic current resulting from the reduction of the corresponding quinone was directly proportional to the logarithmic concentration of the target autoantibodies. The analytical performance of the developed method for the determination of anti-MBP is competitive in terms of sensitivity and range of linearity with that claimed for the only biosensor reported so far in the literature, as well as with commercially available ELISA kits showing a remarkably shorter assay time. The bioplatform was applied to the analysis of serum samples of healthy individuals and patients diagnosed with MS providing results in agreement with the ELISA methodology.","[Guerrero, S.; Sanchez-Tirado, E.; Agui, L.; Gonzalez-Cortes, A.; Yanez-Sedeno, P.; Pingarron, J.

Fertility and the course of pregnancy are not affected by MS; however, people with MS (pwMS) may have concerns that there will be a greater risk of complications to the mother and/or adverse pregnancy outcomes either due to the disease or to ongoing medication. This survey aimed to understand family planning decision making in pwMS and related unmet educational needs. Methods: A total of 332 pwMS across the USA, UK, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain were recruited from a specialist patient panel agency to participate in a smartphone-enabled standing panel. The 80-question survey focussed on decision making and information sources for pwMS regarding family planning, as well as behavior during and after pregnancy. Male patients with MS did not respond to specific questions on pregnancy. Survey results were directly compared with the 2016 US and 2010 UN census data. Results: pwMS were more likely to have no children than the general population, particularly in the subgroup of patients aged 36-45 years. A total of 56% of pwMS reported that the disease affected, with different degrees of impact, their family planning decision making. Of these, 21% significantly changed their plans for timing of pregnancy and the number of children, and 14% decided against having children. Participants indicated that healthcare professionals were the primary source of information on family planning (81% of responses). The timing of planned pregnancy was not considered when selecting treatment by 78% of participants. Conclusion: MS was found to significantly impact family planning decision making, with pwMS significantly less likely to have children in comparison with the general population.","[Bonavita, Simona; Lavorgna, Luigi] Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Dept Adv Med & Surg Sci, Naples, Italy; [Bonavita, Simona] Neurol Inst Diag & Care Hermitage Capodimonte, Naples, Italy; [Worton, Hilary] Aequus Res, London, England; [Russell, Susan] EMD Serono Res & Dev Inst Inc, Billerica, MA USA; [Russell, Susan; Jack, Dominic] Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany",Universita della Campania Vanvitelli; Merck KGaA; EMD Serono Inc.; Merck KGaA,"Bonavita, S (corresponding author), Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Dept Adv Med & Surg Sci, Naples, Italy.;Bonavita, S (corresponding author), Neurol Inst Diag & Care Hermitage Capodimonte, Naples, Italy.",simona.bonavita@unicampania.it,"Lavorgna, Luigi/R-2696-2016; Bonavita, Simona/AGN-5124-2022; Lavorgna, Luigi/AAG-9119-2021","Lavorgna, Luigi/0000-0003-4625-4236; Bonavita, Simona/0000-0002-8561-9720; Lavorgna, Luigi/0000-0003-4625-4236","EMD Serono, a business of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany","EMD Serono, a business of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany","This study was sponsored by EMD Serono, a business of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany.",,33,7,7,1,1,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-2295,,,FRONT NEUROL,Front.

While increased gait variability is a robust biomarker of fall risk in PwMS, gait variability in more ecologically related tasks is unclear. Here, the effects of turning and negotiating an obstacle on gait variability in PwMS were investigated. PwMS and matched healthy controls were instrumented with inertial measurement units on the feet, lumbar, and torso. Subjects completed a walk and turn (WT) with and without an obstacle crossing (OW). Each task was partitioned into pre-turn, post-turn, pre-obstacle, and post-obstacle phases for analysis. Spatial and temporal gait measures and measures of trunk rotation were captured for each phase of each task. In the WT condition, PwMS demonstrated significantly more variability in lumbar and trunk yaw range of motion and rate, lateral foot deviation, cadence, and step time after turning than before. In the OW condition, PwMS demonstrated significantly more variability in both spatial and temporal gait parameters in obstacle approach after turning compared to before turning. No significant differences in gait variability were observed after negotiating an obstacle, regardless of turning or not. Results suggest that the context of gait variability measurement is important. The increased number of variables impacted from turning and the influence of turning on obstacle negotiation suggest that varying tasks must be considered together rather than in isolation to obtain an informed understanding of gait variability that more closely resembles everyday walking.","[Weed, Lara; McGinnis, Ryan S.] Univ Vermont, Dept Elect & Biomed Engn, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Little, Casey; Kasser, Susan L.] Univ Vermont, Dept Rehabil & Movement Sci, Burlington, VT 05405 USA",University of Vermont; University of Vermont,"McGinnis, RS (corresponding author), Univ Vermont, Dept Elect & Biomed Engn, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.",laraweed@stanford.edu; casey.little@uvm.edu; susan.kasser@med.uvm.edu; ryan.mcginnis@uvm.edu,"Weed, Lara/ABF-3784-2020","Weed, Lara/0000-0003-3211-753X; McGinnis, Ryan/0000-0001-8396-6967",,,,,48,2,2,1,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,SEP,2021,21,17,,,,,,,5806,10.3390/s21175806,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s21175806,,,15,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,UO2MW,34502697,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-02-20,WOS:000694535000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The current gold-standard measures of RLS severity rely on a fixed seven-day time frame, which limits the ability of these measures for studying acute changes in RLS severity. The present study examined if subjective and objective scores from the suggested immobilization test (SIT) provide a valid and reliable acute measure of RLS severity in persons with MS. Patients/methods: Participants with MS and RLS (n = 20) and MS without RLS (n = 20) were matched by age, gender, and disability. All participants completed validated questionnaires for RLS severity followed by the SIT, conducted at 18:00 (+/- 15 min) on the same day of the week for two consecutive weeks. Participants wore accelerometer devices for seven nights to capture periodic limb movements (PLMs) during the night. Results: Self-reported RLS severity during the SIT had excellent construct validity and convergent validity, but moderate test-retest reliability. Device-measured PLMs, while not themselves a direct measure of RLS severity, were significantly associated with PLMs during the night and had excellent test-retest reliability during the SIT in adults with MS. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the SIT represents a valid acute measure for capturing self-reported sensory aspects of RLS severity and should be considered in future research and clinical practice as a standardized acute measure of subjective RLS severity in adults with MS who present with RLS.

In total, 72 PwMS and smartphone owners were included in the analysis (N=72).Interventions: Using location tracking, the newly developed Whereabouts app generates an individual-specific timeline of societal participation activities each day, consisting of location and transportation intervals. Subsequently, this timeline is real time enriched by the user with self -reported ratings of meaningfulness and perceived strain of these societal participation activities. The app is based on the International Classifica-tion of Functioning, Disability and Health and was developed in an iterative process.Main Outcome Measure(s): Usability of the newly developed Whereabouts app was evaluated by analyzing the effectiveness, efficiency, and user satisfaction.Results: Regarding effectiveness, the app correctly assessed the type, frequency, and duration of different societal participation activities for 96.1% of the participation activities. The self-reported ratings of societal participation varied for meaningfulness (range, 5-8), perceived strain (range, 2-6), and meaningfulness of the perceived strain (range, 5-8). The latter 2 were highly correlated (r=0.857). With regards to efficiency, 3.9% of the generated participation activities had to be excluded due to inaccuracy or incompleteness. Relating to user satisfaction, 57.3% of PwMS reported that they were satisfied with the usability of the app and 59.7% stated that it gave a realistic overview of their daily activities. However, 54.4% PwMS missed the possibility to specify activities at home, to add activities in more detail, and to correct mistakes.Conclusions: The Whereabouts app demonstrates usability in assessing real-time, individual-specific meaningful societal participation. Improve-ments are recommended, such as the possibility to specify participation activities and to generate a graphic overview.

Digital health solutions today range from non-regulated wellness applications and research-grade exploratory instruments to regulated software as a medical device (SaMD). This paper discusses the considerations and complexities in developing innovative, effective, and validated SaMD for multiple sclerosis (MS). The development of SaMD requires a formalised approach (design control), inclusive of technical verification and analytical validation to ensure reliability. SaMD must be clinically evaluated, characterised for benefit and risk, and must conform to regulatory requirements associated with device classification. Cybersecurity and data privacy are also critical. Careful consideration of patient and provider needs throughout the design and testing process help developers overcome challenges of adoption in medical practice. Here, we explore the development pathway for SaMD in MS, leveraging experiences from the development of Floodlight (TM) MS, a continually evolving bundled solution of SaMD for remote functional assessment of MS. The development process will be charted while reflecting on common challenges in the digital space, with a view to providing insights for future developers.","[van der Walt, Anneke; Butzkueven, Helmut] Monash Univ, Cent Clin Sch, Dept Neurosci, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia; [van der Walt, Anneke] The Alfred, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia; [Shin, Robert K.] MedStar Georgetown Univ Hosp, Washington, DC 20007 USA; [Midaglia, Luciana] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Recerca Vall dHebron VHIR, Ctr Esclerosi Multiple Catalunya Cemcat, Serv Neurol Neuroimmunol,Hosp Univ Vall dHebron, Barcelona 08035, Spain; [Capezzuto, Luca; Lindemann, Michael; Davies, Geraint; Butler, Lesley M.; Costantino, Cristina] F Hoffmann La Roche Ltd, CH-4070 Basel, Switzerland; [Montalban, Xavier] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Multiple Sclerosis Ctr Catalonia Cemcat, Dept Neurol Neuroimmunol, Hosp Univ Vall dHebron, Barcelona 08035, Spain",Monash University; Georgetown University; Autonomous University of Barcelona; Hospital Universitari Vall d'Hebron; Vall d'Hebron Institut de Recerca (VHIR); Roche Holding; Autonomous University of Barcelona; Hospital Universitari Vall d'Hebron,"van der Walt, A (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Cent Clin Sch, Dept Neurosci, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia.;van der Walt, A (corresponding author), The Alfred, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia.",anneke.vanderwalt@monash.edu; helmut.butzkueven@monash.edu; Robert.K.Shin@gunet.georgetown.edu; lmidaglia@cem-cat.org; luca.capezzuto@roche.com; michaellindemann@roche.com; geraint.davies.gd1@roche.com; lesley.butler@roche.com; costantino.cristina@gene.com; xavier.montalban@cem-cat.org,"Montalban, Xavier/J-5938-2016; Lindemann, Michael/ABD-1137-2021","Montalban, Xavier/0000-0002-0098-9918; Lindemann, Michael/0000-0003-1010-3890","F.

Seven days of passive monitoring of gait and turning were carried out in a pilot study of 26 PwMS in home settings using wearable inertial sensors. The retrospective fall history was collected at the baseline. After gait and turning data collection in daily life, PwMS were followed biweekly for a year and were classified as fallers if they experienced >1 fall. The ability of short-term passive monitoring of gait and turning, as well as retrospective fall history to predict future falls were compared using receiver operator curves and regression analysis. The history of retrospective falls was not identified as a significant predictor of future falls in this cohort (AUC = 0.62, p = 0.32). Among quantitative monitoring measures of gait and turning, the pitch at toe-off was the best predictor of falls (AUC = 0.86, p < 0.01). Fallers had a smaller pitch of their feet at toe-off, reflecting less plantarflexion during the push-off phase of walking, which can impact forward propulsion and swing initiation and can result in poor foot clearance and an increased metabolic cost of walking. In conclusion, our cohort of PwMS showed that objective monitoring of gait and turning in daily life can identify those at future risk of falls, and the pitch at toe-off was the single most influential predictor of future falls. Therefore, interventions aimed at improving the strength of plantarflexion muscles, range of motion, and increased proprioceptive input may benefit PwMS at future fall risk.","[Arpan, Ishu; Shah, Vrutangkumar V.; Harker, Graham; Carlson-Kuhta, Patricia; Spain, Rebecca; Mancini, Martina; Horak, Fay B.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Neurol, Portland, OR 97239 USA; [Arpan, Ishu] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Adv Imaging Res Ctr, Portland, OR 97239 USA; [Shah, Vrutangkumar V.; McNames, James; El-Gohary, Mahmoud; Horak, Fay B.] APDM Wearable Technol, 2828 S Corbett Ave,Ste 135, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [McNames, James] Portland State Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, 1825 SW Broadway, Portland, OR 97201 USA",Oregon Health & Science University; Oregon Health & Science University; Portland State University,"Arpan, I (corresponding author), Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Neurol, Portland, OR 97239 USA.;Arpan, I (corresponding author), Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Adv Imaging Res Ctr, Portland, OR 97239 USA.",arpan@ohsu.edu,,"Shah, Vrutangkumar/0000-0002-8626-1089; Horak, Fay/0000-0001-7704-5459; Carlson-Kuhta, Patricia/0000-0002-5794-4155","Department of Defense [R44AG055388, R43AG044863];  [W81XWH-18-1-0425]",Department of Defense(United States Department of Defense); ,This researchwas funded by theNational Institutes ofHealth grants fromtheNational Institute on Aging (#R44AG055388 and #R43AG044863) and Department of Defense #W81XWH-18-1-0425.,,33,0,0,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,AUG,2022,22,16,,,,,,,5940,10.3390/s22165940,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s22165940,,,10,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,4A8BU,36015700,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-02-20,WOS:000845320300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The influencing vital and environmental factors are captured with a smartwatch and phone sensors. Patients can track these factors within the app. To individually counteract their fatigue, a fatigue course, based on the current treatment guidelines, was implemented. The course implies knowledge about fatigue and MS, exercises, energy-conservation management, and cognitive behavioral therapy. Based on the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change, the design of the Fimo health app follows the ten strategies of the process of change, which is a proven approach to designing health intervention programs. By monitoring fatigue and individual influencing factors, patients can better understand and manage their fatigue. They can share their data and insights about fatigue and its influencing factors with their doctors.

It manifests as a cognitive or physical condition. Fatigue is poorly understood, and effective therapies are missing. Furthermore, there is a lack of methods to measure fatigue objectively. Fatigability, the measurable decline in performance during a task, has been suggested as a complementary method to quantify fatigue. Objective To develop a new and objective measurement of cognitive fatigability and investigate its association with perceived fatigue. Methods We introduced the cognitive fatigability assessment test (cFAST), a novel smartphone-based test to quantify cognitive fatigability. Forty-two people with multiple sclerosis (23 fatigued and 19 non-fatigued, defined by the Fatigue Scale for Motor and Cognitive Functions) took part in our validation study. Patients completed cFAST twice. We used t-tests, Monte Carlo sampling, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curves to evaluate our approach using two sets of proposed metrics. Results When classifying fatigue, our fatigability metric Delta response time has a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.74 (95% CI 0.64-0.84), making it the best performing metric for this task. Furthermore, Delta response time shows a statistically significant difference between the fatigued and non-fatigued groups (t = 2.27, P = .03). Particularly, cognitively-fatigued patients decline in performance, while non-fatigued patients do not. Conclusions We introduce cFAST, a new instrument to quantify cognitive fatigability. Our pilot study provides evidence that cognitive fatigability assessment test produces a quantifiable drop in cognitive performance in a short period. Furthermore, our results indicate that cFAST may have the potential to serve as a surrogate for subjective cognitive fatigue. cFAST is significantly shorter than the existing fatigability assessments and does not require specialized equipment. Thus, it could enable frequent and remote monitoring, which could substantially aid clinicians in better understanding and treating fatigue.","[Barrios, Liliana; Holz, Christian] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Univ Str 6, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Amon, Rok; Oldrati, Pietro; Hilty, Marc; Lutterotti, Andreas] Univ Hosp Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; [Oldrati, Pietro; Hilty, Marc; Lutterotti, Andreas] Univ Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; [Lutterotti, Andreas] Neurozentrum Bellevue, Zurich, Switzerland; [Lutterotti, Andreas] Dept Neurol Hirslanden, Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Zurich; University Zurich Hospital; University of Zurich,"Barrios, L (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Univ Str 6, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",liliana.barrios@inf.ethz.ch,,"Oldrati, Pietro/0000-0001-5551-4306",Clinical Research Priority Program (CRPP) -precisionMS of the University of Zurich; Personalized Health and Related Technologies (PHRT) technological transfer of the ETH Zurich,Clinical Research Priority Program (CRPP) -precisionMS of the University of Zurich; Personalized Health and Related Technologies (PHRT) technological transfer of the ETH Zurich,This project was funded by the Clinical Research Priority Program (CRPP) -precisionMS of the University of Zurich and the Personalized Health and Related Technologies (PHRT) technological transfer of the ETH Zurich.

In particular, the medical community could largely benefit from this type of devices as they could provide the clinicians with a valuable tool for assessing gait impairment. Motion sensor data are however complex and there is an urgent unmet need to develop sound statistical methods for analyzing such data and extracting clinically relevant information. In this article, we measure gait by following the hip rotation over time and the resulting statistical unit is a time series of unit quaternions. We explore the possibility to form groups of patients with similar walking impairment by taking into account their walking data and their global decease severity with semi-supervised clustering. We generalize a compromise-based method named hclustcompro to unit quaternion time series by combining it with the proper dissimilarity quaternion dynamic time warping. We apply this method on patients diagnosed with multiple sclerosis to form groups of patients with similar walking deficiencies while accounting for the clinical assessment of their overall disability. We also compare the compromise-based clustering approach with the method mergeTrees that falls into a sub-class of ensemble clustering named collaborative clustering. The results provide a first proof of both the interest of using wearable motion sensors for assessing gait impairment and the use of prior knowledge to guide the clustering process. It also demonstrates that compromise-based clustering is a more appropriate approach in this context.","[Drouin, Pierre; Stamm, Aymeric; Bellanger, Lise] Univ Nantes, Lab Math Jean Leray, Nantes, France; [Drouin, Pierre; Chevreuil, Laurent; Graillot, Vincent] UmanIT, Nantes, France; [Barbin, Laetitia; Laplaud, David-Axel] CHU, Serv Neurol, CRTI Inserm U1064, CIC, Nantes, France; [Barbin, Laetitia; Laplaud, David-Axel] Univ Nantes, Nantes, France; [Gourraud, Pierre-Antoine] Univ Nantes, Ctr Rech Transplantat & Immunol, UMR 1064, ATIP Avenir,CHU Nates,INSERM, Nantes, France; [Drouin, Pierre] UmanIT, 13 Pl Sophier Trebuchet, F-44000 Nantes, France",Nantes Universite; Nantes Universite; CHU de Nantes; Nantes Universite; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Nantes Universite,"Drouin, P (corresponding author), UmanIT, 13 Pl Sophier Trebuchet, F-44000 Nantes, France.",pdrouin@umanit.fr,,"Stamm, Aymeric/0000-0002-8725-3654",Fondation pour l'Aide a la Recherche sur la Sclerose en Plaques,Fondation pour l'Aide a la Recherche sur la Sclerose en Plaques(Fondation pour la Recherche Medicale),Fondation pour l'Aide a la Recherche sur la Sclerose en Plaques,,59,0,0,1,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0277-6715,1097-0258,,STAT MED,Stat.

Instrumented gait analysis provides a plethora of metrics for quantifying concurrent factors contributing to gait deterioration. However, a gait model discriminating underlying features contributing to this deterioration is lacking in pwMS. This study aimed at developing and validating such a model. Methods: The gait of 24 healthy controls and 114 pwMS with mild, moderate, or severe disability was measured with inertial sensors on the shanks and lower trunk while walking for 6 minutes along a hospital corridor. Twenty out of thirty-six initially explored metrics computed from the sensor data met the quality criteria for exploratory factor analysis. This analysis provided the sought model, which underwent a confirmatory factor analysis before being used to characterize gait impairment across the three disability groups. Results: A gait model consisting of five domains (rhythm/variability, pace, asymmetry, and forward and lateral dynamic balance) was revealed by the factor analysis, which was able to highlight gait abnormalities across the disability groups: significant alterations in rhythm/variability-, asymmetry-, and pace-based features were present in the mild group, but these were more profound in the moderate and severe groups. Deterioration in dynamic balance-based features was only noted in pwMS with a moderate and severe disability. Conclusion: A conceptual model of gait for disease-specific mobility assessment in pwMS was successfully developed and tested. Significance: The new model, built with metrics that represent gait impairment in pwMS, highlighted clinically relevant changes across different disability levels, including those with no clinically observable walking disability. This shows the clear potential as a monitoring biomarker in pwMS.","[Angelini, Lorenza; Buckley, Ellen; Bonci, Tecla; Mazza, Claudia] Univ Sheffield, Dept Mech Engn, Sheffield S1 3JD, S Yorkshire, England; [Angelini, Lorenza; Buckley, Ellen; Bonci, Tecla; Mazza, Claudia] Univ Sheffield, Insigneo Inst Silico Med, Sheffield S1 3JD, S Yorkshire, England; [Radford, Alexandra] NIHR Sheffield Biomed Res Ctr, Natl Inst Hlth Res NIHR, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Radford, Alexandra] NIHR Sheffield Biomed Res Ctr, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Sharrack, Basil] NIHR Sheffield Biomed Res Ctr, Sheffield Teaching Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, Acad Dept Neurosci, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Sharrack, Basil; Paling, David] Sheffield Inst Translat Neurosci, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Paling, David] Sheffield Teaching Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, Acad Dept Neurosci, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Nair, Krishnan Padmakumari Sivaraman] Univ Sheffield, Insigneo Inst Silico Med, Acad Dept Neurosci, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Nair, Krishnan Padmakumari Sivaraman] Sheffield Teaching Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield; University of Sheffield; University of Sheffield; University of Sheffield; University of Sheffield; University of Sheffield; University of Sheffield,"Angelini, L (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Dept Mech Engn, Sheffield S1 3JD, S Yorkshire, England.;Angelini, L (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Insigneo Inst Silico Med, Sheffield S1 3JD, S Yorkshire, England.",l.angelini@sheffield.ac.uk,"Buckley, Ellen/HMV-0426-2023","Mazza, Claudia/0000-0002-5215-1746; Bonci, Tecla/0000-0002-8255-4730","National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) through the Sheffield Biomedical Research Centre (BRC) [IS-BRC-1215-20017]; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme; EFPIA via the Innovative Medicine Initiative 2 (Mobilise-D project) [IMI22017-13-7-820820]; U.K. Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (MultiSim and MultiSim2 projects) [EP/K03877X/1, EP/S032940/1]; EPSRC [EP/S032940/1, EP/K03877X/1] Funding Source: UKRI",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) through the Sheffield Biomedical Research Centre (BRC)(National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)); European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme; EFPIA via the Innovative Medicine Initiative 2 (Mobilise-D project); U.K. Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (MultiSim and MultiSim2 projects); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"This work was co-funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) through the Sheffield Biomedical Research Centre (BRC), under Grant IS-BRC-1215-20017, by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme and EFPIA via the Innovative Medicine Initiative 2 (Mobilise-D project), under Grant IMI22017-13-7-820820, and by the U.K. Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (MultiSim and MultiSim2 projects), under Grants EP/K03877X/1 and EP/S032940/1.",,77,0,0,0,4,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0018-9294,1558-2531,,IEEE T BIO-MED ENG,IEEE Trans.

These include the required expert knowledge, time for data collection, and missing standards for data analysis and reporting. Here, we provide a technological review of wearable and vision-based portable motion analysis tools that emerged in the last decade with recent applications in neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease and Multiple Sclerosis. The goal is to enable the reader to understand the available technologies with their individual strengths and limitations in order to make an informed decision for own investigations and clinical applications.

The contribution of walking capacity, endurance, behavior, and MS comorbidities remains relatively undefined and may provide valuable insights into the limitations toward physical activity in youth with MS. The primary objective of this study was to investigate differences in walking capacity, endurance, and real-world behaviors of daily activity between youth with POMS and controls. Methods Youth diagnosed with MS prior to 18 years and aged 21 years or younger were recruited in addition to healthy controls. Participants completed questionnaires to quantify fatigue, depression, and physical activity levels and the timed 2- and 6-minute walk (6MW) as an assessment of walking capacity and endurance. Participants completed questionnaires to quantify fatigue, depression, and physical activity levels. Participants also completed the timed 2- and 6-minute walk (6MW) as an assessment of walking capacity and endurance and were sent home with a waist-worn accelerometer to assess real-world walking behavior. Results Forty-five patients with POMS and 85 control participants were enrolled. The POMS cohort had a mean age of 16.9 +/- 2.7 years, with a mean disease duration of 2.8 +/- 2.6 years. A greater proportion of the POMS cohort was overweight/obese compared with controls (75% vs 33%). Participants with MS walked a significantly shorter distance in 6 minutes compared with controls (1,848 feet vs 2,134 feet, p < 0.0001) and, unlike controls, were unable to accelerate to their peak speed at the end of the 6MW. Body mass index category and MS disease significantly affected 6MW performance. Using continuous accelerometry, participants with MS spent less time in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity compared with controls (20.4 vs 35.4 min/d, p = 0.0003). The POMS cohort reported significantly higher levels of depression and fatigue but self-reported similar levels of daily physical activity as controls. Discussion Youth with POMS exhibit slower 6MW performance and less daily engagement in moderateto-vigorous physical activity, suggesting limitations in functional walking capacity, endurance, and daily activity behavior. Limitations in walking endurance and capacity are most prominent in those youth who are overweight/obese and living with MS. Classification of Evidence This study provides Class III evidence that, compared with healthy controls, patients with POMS walk shorter distances on the 6MW test, are less able to accelerate to peak speed at the end of the test, and are less physically active.","[Brenton, J.

Spatial (trace accuracy), temporal (mean and variability in linear, angular, and radial drawing velocities, and dwell time ratio), and spatiotemporal features (trace celerity) were cross-sectionally analyzed for correlation with standard clinical and brain magnetic resonance imaging (normalized brain volume and total lesion volume) disease burden measures, and for capacity to differentiate people with multiple sclerosis from healthy controls.Results: Data from 69 people with multiple sclerosis and 18 healthy controls were analyzed. Trace accuracy (all shapes), linear velocity variability (circle, figure-of-8, spiral shapes), and radial velocity variability (spiral shape) had a mostly fair/moderate-to-good correlation (|r| = 0.14-0.66) with all disease burden measures. Trace celerity also had mostly fair/moderate-to-good correlation (|r| = 0.18-0.41) with Nine-Hole Peg Test performance, cerebellar functional system score, and brain magnetic resonance imaging. Furthermore, partial correlation analysis related these results to motor impairment. People with multiple sclerosis showed greater drawing velocity variability, though slower mean velocity, than healthy controls. Linear velocity (spiral shape) and angular velocity (circle shape) potentially differentiate functionally normal people with multiple sclerosis from healthy controls.Interpretation: The Draw a Shape Test objectively assesses upper extremity impairment and correlates with all disease burden measures, thus aiding multiple sclerosis-related upper extremity impairment characterization.","[Graves, Jennifer S.

Conventional gait and postural balance analysis techniques like force platforms, motion cameras, etc., are complex, expensive equipment requiring specialist operators, thereby posing a significant challenge toward translation to the clinics. The current manuscript presents an overview and relevant literature summarizing the umbrella of factors associated with neurodegenerative disorder management: from the pathogenesis and motor symptoms of commonly occurring disorders to current alternate practices toward its quantification and mitigation. This article reviews recent advances in technologies and methodologies for managing important neurodegenerative gait and balance disorders, emphasizing assessment and rehabilitation/assistance. The review predominantly focuses on the application of inertial sensors toward various facets of gait analysis, including event detection, spatiotemporal gait parameter measurement, estimation of joint kinematics, and postural balance analysis. In addition, the use of other sensing principles such as foot-force interaction measurement, electromyography techniques, electrogoniometers, force-myography, ultrasonic, piezoelectric, and microphone sensors has also been explored. The review also examined the commercially available wearable gait analysis systems. Additionally, a summary of recent progress in therapeutic approaches, viz., wearables, virtual reality (VR), and phytochemical compounds, has also been presented, explicitly targeting the neuro-motor and functional impairments associated with these disorders. Efforts toward therapeutic and functional rehabilitation through VR, wearables, and different phytochemical compounds are presented using recent examples of research across the commonly occurring neurodegenerative conditions [viz., Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), multiple sclerosis, Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)]. Studies exploring the potential role of Phyto compounds in mitigating commonly associated neurodegenerative pathologies such as mitochondrial dysfunction, alpha-synuclein accumulation, imbalance of free radicals, etc., are also discussed in breadth. Parameters such as joint angles, plantar pressure, and muscle force can be measured using portable and wearable sensors like accelerometers, gyroscopes, footswitches, force sensors, etc. Kinetic foot insoles and inertial measurement tools are widely explored for studying kinematic and kinetic parameters associated with gait. With advanced correlation algorithms and extensive RCTs, such measurement techniques can be an effective clinical and home-based monitoring and rehabilitation tool for neuro-impaired gait. As evident from the present literature, although the vast majority of works reported are not clinically and extensively validated to derive a firm conclusion about the effectiveness of such techniques, wearable sensors present a promising impact toward dealing with neurodegenerative motor disorders.",,,,sudip.paul.bhu@gmail.com,,"Das, Ratan/0000-0003-1552-5742","Twinning Program of the Department of Biotechnology, Government of India; IMPRINT-2, DST-SERB, Government of India","Twinning Program of the Department of Biotechnology, Government of India; IMPRINT-2, DST-SERB, Government of India","This work was jointly supported by the Twinning Program of the Department of Biotechnology, Government of India, and IMPRINT-2, DST-SERB, Government of India.",,284,0,0,9,16,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,1662-453X,,FRONT NEUROSCI-SWITZ,Front.

The researchers are refining the therapeutics and striving to eradicate the life-threatening burden of chronic diseases by upsurging and proposing advanced instrumentation. There are a number of neurological diseases that cause alterations in the genetic sequences due to pathogenic or self-negligence. According to the WHO, stroke, septicemia, PD, epilepsy, and MS are found to be the deadliest and most invading among millions of people. Various diagnostic methods are employed for monitoring these disorders in the human body at an early stage, in process of cure. The current review highlights the strengths of several advanced detection devices, such as biosensors to identify and quantify biomarkers, some sensing gadgets, and other genetic tactics or innovations to ameliorate traditional protocols. Furthermore, the meticulous description of ongoing experiments with the help of relevant case studies of neurodegenerative disorders supports the impact and vitality of advanced equipment. Further, the necessity of biosensors in distinct disorders to aid in an early diagnosis, and the influence of nano-based materials in preparation is emphasized. Finally, several issues that should be addressed in upcoming decades with the steep rise in analytical technology have been discussed.","[Chougale, Amit; Vedante, Shruti] Univ Adelaide, Dept Chem Engn, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia; [Kulkarni, Guruprasad; Patnawar, Sneha] Kolhapur Inst Technol Coll Engn, Dept Biotechnol, Kolhapur 416234, Maharashtra, India",University of Adelaide,"Chougale, A (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Dept Chem Engn, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia.",amit.chougale@adelaide.edu.au,,,,,,,108,0,0,1,1,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,WEINHEIM,"POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY",2365-6549,,,CHEMISTRYSELECT,ChemistrySelect,DEC 6,2022,7,45,,,,,,,,10.1002/slct.202203155,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/slct.202203155,,,16,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry,6V4II,,,,,2023-02-20,WOS:000895013300041,View Full Record in Web of Science

Measuring changes in muscle force exertion is essential for tracking the progress of athletes during training, for evaluating patients' recovery after muscle injury, and also for assisting the diagnosis of conditions such as muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, or Parkinson's disease. Traditional hardware for strength evaluation requires technical training for operation, generates discrete time points for muscle assessment, and is implemented in controlled settings. The ability to continuously monitor muscle force without restricting the range of motion or adapting the exercise protocol to suit specific hardware would allow for a richer dataset that can help unlock critical features of muscle health and strength evaluation. In this paper, we employ wearable, ultra-sensitive soft strain sensors for tracking changes in muscle deformation during contractions. We demonstrate the sensors' sensitivity to isometric contractions, as well as the sensors' capacity to track changes in peak torque over the course of an isokinetic fatiguing protocol for the knee extensors. The wearable soft system was able to efficiently estimate peak joint torque reduction caused by muscle fatigue (mean NRMSE = 0.15 +/- 0.03 ).","[Alvarez, Jonathan T.; Gerez, Lucas F.; Araromi, Oluwaseun A.; Hunter, Jessica G.; Choe, Dabin K.; Payne, Christopher J.; Wood, Robert J.; Walsh, Conor J.] Harvard Univ, John A Paulson Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Payne, Christopher J.] Viam Inc, New York, NY 10023 USA",Harvard University,"Alvarez, JT (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, John A Paulson Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",jonathanalvarez@g.harvard.edu; welsh@seas.harvard.edu,,"Alvarez, Jonathan/0000-0003-0679-895X",National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research [R01DE013349],National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Dental & Craniofacial Research (NIDCR)),This work was supported by the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research under Award R01DE013349.,,48,0,0,12,12,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1534-4320,1558-0210,,IEEE T NEUR SYS REH,IEEE Trans.

We aimed at assessing adherence to a smartphone-based e-diary, which was designed to collect patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Secondary objectives were to evaluate the construct and predictive validity of e-diary derived PROs and to explore the various factors that were associated with changes in PROs over time. Materials and methods In this observational cohort study patients downloaded an MS tailored e-diary into their personal smartphones. Report of PROs was enquired once monthly for a period of one year through a smartphone-based application, using previously validated tools. An e-diary derived bodily function summary score (eBF) was defined as the sum of scores depicting vision, limbs function, pain, bowl/ bladder dysfunction, pseudobulbar affect and spasticity. Multiple linear regression and analysis of covariance were used to determine the association between PROs, clinician-reported outcomes (ClinROs) of disease activity and quality of life (QoL). Regression coefficient analysis was used to compare the slope of change in eBF before and after a relapse. Results 97 pwMS downloaded the e-diary [Female: 64 (66%), EDSS 3.42.1]. 76 patients (78%) completed the 12-month study period. 53 patients (55%) submitted >= 75% of requested surveys. Anxiety was negatively associated with adherence to periodic PROs assessments by the e-diary. E-diary derived PROs were significantly correlated with corresponding functional system scores (0.38 < r < 0.8, P < 0.001). eBF score significantly predicted QoL (beta = -0.36, P = 0.001) while EDSS did not. Change in eBF score over time was independently associated with the occurrence of an MS relapse (F = 4.4, P = 0.04), anxiety (F = 6.4, P = 0.01) and depression (F = 5.1, P = 0.03). Individual regression slopes of eBF scores were significantly higher pre-relapse than post-relapse (3.0 +/- 3.3 vs. -0.8 +/- 2.0, P = 0.007). Conclusion Adherence of pwMS to recording in an e-diary collecting PROs was high. Changes in e-diary derived PROs over time predict clinical MS relapses on the group level and thus carry the potential of usage in clinical research as well as for improved MS care in real world setting.","[Golan, Daniel; Glass-Marmor, Lea; Miller, Ariel] Lady Davis Carmel Med Ctr, Multiple Sclerosis Ctr, Haifa, Israel; [Golan, Daniel; Glass-Marmor, Lea; Miller, Ariel] Lady Davis Carmel Med Ctr, Dept Neurol, Haifa, Israel; [Golan, Daniel; Sagiv, Smadar; Glass-Marmor, Lea; Miller, Ariel] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Rappaport Fac Med, Haifa, Israel",Clalit Health Services; Carmel Medical Center; Clalit Health Services; Carmel Medical Center; Technion Israel Institute of Technology; Rappaport Faculty of Medicine,"Miller, A (corresponding author), Lady Davis Carmel Med Ctr, Multiple Sclerosis Ctr, Haifa, Israel.;Miller, A (corresponding author), Lady Davis Carmel Med Ctr, Dept Neurol, Haifa, Israel.;Miller, A (corresponding author), Technion Israel Inst Technol, Rappaport Fac Med, Haifa, Israel.",millera@technion.ac.il,,"Miller, Ariel/0000-0001-5843-6841; Golan, Daniel/0000-0003-0545-7627",Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd as part of the Israeli National Network of Excellence in Neuroscience (NNE); Merry Sherman Saifer Fund,Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd as part of the Israeli National Network of Excellence in Neuroscience (NNE)(Teva Pharmaceutical Industries); Merry Sherman Saifer Fund,"Funding for this research was provided by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd as part of the Israeli National Network of Excellence in Neuroscience (NNE) and by the Merry Sherman Saifer Fund.

Accordingly, the demand for biosensors for the early diagnosis of disease is increasing. However, the measurement range of existing electrochemical sensors is relatively high, which is not suitable for early disease diagnosis, requiring the detection of small amounts of biocomponents. Various attempts have been made to overcome this and amplify the signal, including binding with various labeling molecules, such as DNA, enzymes, nanoparticles, and carbon materials. Efforts are also being made to increase the sensitivity of electrochemical sensors, and the combination of nanomaterials, materials, and biotechnology offers the potential to increase sensitivity in a variety of ways. Recent studies suggest that electrochemical sensors can be a powerful tool in providing comprehensive insights into the targeting and detection of disease-associated biomarkers. Significant advances in nanomaterial and biomolecule approaches for improved sensitivity have resulted in the development of electrochemical biosensors capable of detecting multiple biomarkers in real time in clinically relevant samples. In this review, we have discussed the recent studies on electrochemical sensors for detection of diseases such as diabetes, degenerative diseases, and cancer. Further, we have highlighted new technologies to improve sensitivity using various materials, including DNA, enzymes, nanoparticles, and carbon materials.","[Kim, Jae Hyun; Suh, Young Joon; Park, Dongsung; Yim, Hyoju; Kim, Hongrae; Kim, Hye Jin; Hwang, Kyo Seon] Kyung Hee Univ, Coll Med, Dept Clin Pharmacol & Therapeut, Kyungheedae Ro 26, Seoul 02447, South Korea; [Park, Dongsung; Kim, Hongrae; Yoon, Dae Sung] Korea Univ, Sch Biomed Engn, Seoul 02841, South Korea",Kyung Hee University; Korea University,"Hwang, KS (corresponding author), Kyung Hee Univ, Coll Med, Dept Clin Pharmacol & Therapeut, Kyungheedae Ro 26, Seoul 02447, South Korea.",k.hwang@khu.ac.kr,,"Hwang, Kyo Seon/0000-0003-3590-2074","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) [NRF-2021R1A2C2004760, NRF-2020R1C1C1008641]; Korea Health Industry Development Institute (KHIDI) [HU21C0053]",National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)(National Research Foundation of Korea); Korea Health Industry Development Institute (KHIDI)(Korea Health Industry Development Institute (KHIDI)),"This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF, Grant No. NRF-2021R1A2C2004760, NRF-2020R1C1C1008641) and the Korea Health Industry Development Institute (KHIDI, Grant No. HU21C0053).",,145,10,10,14,40,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2093-9868,2093-985X,,BIOMED ENG LETT,Biomed.

Understanding the usability and acceptability of wearable devices is a core component of this. However, usability assessments to date have focused predominantly on healthy adults. There is a need to understand the patient perspective of wearable devices in participants with chronic health conditions. Methods A systematic review was conducted to identify any study design that included a usability assessment of wearable devices to measure mobility, through gait and physical activity, within five cohorts with chronic conditions (Parkinson's disease [PD], multiple sclerosis [MS], congestive heart failure, [CHF], chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder [COPD], and proximal femoral fracture [PFF]). Results Thirty-seven studies were identified. Substantial heterogeneity in the quality of reporting, the methods used to assess usability, the devices used, and the aims of the studies precluded any meaningful comparisons. Questionnaires were used in the majority of studies (70.3%; n = 26) with a reliance on intervention specific measures (n = 16; 61.5%). For those who used interviews (n = 17; 45.9%), no topic guides were provided, while methods of analysis were not reported in over a third of studies (n = 6; 35.3%). Conclusion Usability of wearable devices is a poorly measured and reported variable in chronic health conditions. Although the heterogeneity in how these devices are implemented implies acceptance, the patient voice should not be assumed. In the absence of being able to make specific usability conclusions, the results of this review instead recommends that future research needs to: (1) Conduct usability assessments as standard, irrespective of the cohort under investigation or the type of study undertaken. (2) Adhere to basic reporting standards (e.g. COREQ) including the basic details of the study. Full copies of any questionnaires and interview guides should be supplied through supplemental files. (3) Utilise mixed methods research to gather a more comprehensive understanding of usability than either qualitative or quantitative research alone will provide. (4) Use previously validated questionnaires alongside any intervention specific measures.","[Keogh, Alison; Argent, Rob; Caulfield, Brian; Johnston, William] Univ Coll Dublin, UCD Sch Publ Hlth Physiotherapy & Sports Sci, Dublin, Ireland; [Keogh, Alison; Argent, Rob; Caulfield, Brian; Johnston, William] Univ Coll Dublin, Insight Ctr Data Analyt, Dublin, Ireland; [Anderson, Amy] Hlth Serv Execut, Dublin, Ireland",University College Dublin; University College Dublin,"Keogh, A (corresponding author), Univ Coll Dublin, Insight Ctr Data Analyt, Dublin, Ireland.",Alison.keogh@ucd.ie,,"Keogh, Alison/0000-0001-5917-6308",Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 Joint Undertaking [820820]; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme; EFPIA,Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 Joint Undertaking; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme; EFPIA,"This project received funding from the Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 Joint Undertaking under grant agreement No 820820.

To do so, standard gait features can be used but they fail to detect subtle changes in several pathologies including multiple sclerosis. Multiple sclerosis is a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system whose symptoms include lower limb impairment, which is why gait trials are commonly used by clinicians for their patients' follow-up. This article describes a method to compare pairs of gait signals, visualize the results and interpret them, based on topological data analysis techniques. Our method is non-parametric and requires no data other than gait signals acquired with inertial measurement units. We introduce tools from topological data analysis (sublevel sets, persistence barcodes) in a practical way to make it as accessible as possible in order to encourage its use by clinicians. We apply our method to study a cohort of patients suffering from progressive multiple sclerosis and healthy subjects. We show that it can help estimate the severity of the disease and also be used for longitudinal follow-up to detect an evolution of the disease or other phenomena such as asymmetry or outliers.","[Bois, Alexandre; Tervil, Brian; Vienne-Jumeau, Alienor; Ricard, Damien; Oudre, Laurent] Univ Paris Saclay, Ctr Borelli, CNRS, ENS Paris Saclay, Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Bois, Alexandre; Tervil, Brian; Vienne-Jumeau, Alienor; Ricard, Damien; Oudre, Laurent] Univ Paris, Ctr Borelli, CNRS, Paris, France; [Moreau, Albane; Vienne-Jumeau, Alienor; Ricard, Damien] Hop Instruct Armees Percy, Serv Neurol, Serv St Armees, Clamart, France; [Ricard, Damien] Ecole St Armees, Ecole Val De Grace, Paris, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite,"Bois, A (corresponding author), Univ Paris Saclay, Ctr Borelli, CNRS, ENS Paris Saclay, Gif Sur Yvette, France.;Bois, A (corresponding author), Univ Paris, Ctr Borelli, CNRS, Paris, France.",alexandre.bois@ens-paris-saclay.fr,,"Bois, Alexandre/0000-0003-2765-7961; Tervil, Brian/0000-0002-7275-2717",,,,,53,0,0,8,9,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,,2022,17,5,,,,,,,e0268475,10.1371/journal.pone.0268475,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0268475,,,23,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,3L3MJ,35560328,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-02-20,WOS:000834668000005,View Full Record in Web of Science

In healthy subjects, the self-selected walking speed is the energetically most optimal. In pwMS, the energetically most optimal walking speed remains underexposed. Therefore, this review aimed to determine the relationship between walking speed and energetic cost of walking (Cw) in pwMS, compared with healthy subjects, thereby assessing the walking speed with the lowest energetic cost. As it is unclear whether the Cw in pwMS differs between overground and treadmill walking, as reported in healthy subjects, a second review aim was to compare both conditions. Method PubMed and Web of Science were systematically searched. Studies assessing pwMS, reporting walking speed (converted to meters per second), and reporting oxygen consumption were included. Study quality was assessed with a modified National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute checklist. The relationship between Cw and walking speed was calculated with a second-order polynomial function and compared between groups and conditions. Results Twenty-nine studies were included (n = 1535 pwMS) of which 8 included healthy subjects (n = 179 healthy subjects). PwMS showed a similar energetically most optimal walking speed of 1.44 m/s with a Cw of 0.16, compared with 0.14 mL O-2/kg/m in healthy subjects. The most optimal walking speed in treadmill was 1.48 m/s, compared with 1.28 m/s in overground walking with a similar Cw. Conclusion Overall, the Cw is elevated in pwMS but with a similar energetically most optimal walking speed, compared with healthy subjects. Treadmill walking showed a similar most optimal Cw but a higher speed, compared with overground walking.","[Theunissen, Kyra; Plasqui, Guy; Brauwers, Bente; Meijer, Kenneth] Maastricht Univ, Med Ctr, Sch Nutr & Translat Res Metab, Dept Nutr & Movement Sci, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Theunissen, Kyra; Boonen, Annelies] Maastricht Univ, Med Ctr, Div Rheumatol, Dept Internal Med, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Theunissen, Kyra; Timmermans, Annick; Meyns, Pieter; Feys, Peter] Publ Hlth Res Inst, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Feys, Peter] Hasselt Univ, Fac Rehabil Sci, REVAL, Rehabilitat Res Ctr, Hasselt, Germany; [Feys, Peter] Univ MS Ctr, Melsbroek, Belgium",Maastricht University; Maastricht University; Hasselt University,"Theunissen, K (corresponding author), Minderbroedersberg 4-6,6211 LK, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.",kyra.theunissen@maastrichtuniversity.nl,"Meijer, Kenneth/A-8573-2014","Meijer, Kenneth/0000-0001-8236-8754; Theunissen, Kyra/0000-0002-1645-0001; Meyns, Pieter/0000-0003-2218-187X; Timmermans, Annick/0000-0002-5461-947X; Feys, Peter/0000-0002-5680-5495",BOF UHasselt-Maastricht UMC+ cooperation,BOF UHasselt-Maastricht UMC+ cooperation,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This project is funded by special research fund 2017 call for doctoral grants in the framework of BOF UHasselt-Maastricht UMC+ cooperation.",,80,4,4,1,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1545-9683,1552-6844,,NEUROREHAB NEURAL RE,Neurorehabil.

Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells can differentiate into new replacement oligodendrocytes; however, remyelination is insufficient to protect neurons from degeneration in people with MS. We previously reported that 4 weeks of daily low-intensity repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in an intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) pattern increased the number of new myelinating oligodendrocytes in healthy adult mice. This study translates this rTMS protocol and aims to determine its safety and tolerability for people living with MS. We will also perform magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and symptom assessments as preliminary indicators of myelin addition following rTMS. Methods: Participants (N = 30, aged 18-65 years) will have a diagnosis of relapsing-remitting or secondary progressive MS. <= 2 weeks before the intervention, eligible, consenting participants will complete a physical exam, baseline brain MRI scan and participant-reported MS symptom assessments [questionnaires: Fatigue Severity Scale, Quality of Life (AQoL-8D), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; and smartphone-based measures of cognition (electronic symbol digit modalities test), manual dexterity (pinching test, draw a shape test) and gait (U-Turn test)]. Participants will be pseudo-randomly allocated to rTMS (n=20) or sham (placebo; n=10), stratified by sex. rTMS or sham will be delivered 5 days per week for 4 consecutive weeks (20 sessions, 6 min per day). rTMS will be applied using a 90-mm circular coil at low-intensity (25% maximum stimulator output) in an iTBS pattern. For sham, the coil will be oriented 90 degrees to the scalp, preventing the magnetic field from stimulating the brain. Adverse events will be recorded daily. We will evaluate participant blinding after the first, 10th and final session. After the final session, participants will repeat symptom assessments and brain MRI, for comparison with baseline. Participant-reported assessments will be repeated at 4-month post-allocation follow-up. Discussion: This study will determine whether this rTMS protocol is safe and tolerable for people with MS. MRI and participant-reported symptom assessments will serve as preliminary indications of rTMS efficacy for myelin addition to inform further studies.","[Makowiecki, Kalina; Stevens, Natasha; Cullen, Carlie L.; Zarghami, Amin; Nguyen, Phuong Tram; Johnson, Lewis; Young, Kaylene M.; Taylor, Bruce V.] Univ Tasmania, Menzies Inst Med Res, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Rodger, Jennifer] Univ Western Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Crawley, WA, Australia; [Rodger, Jennifer] Perron Inst Neurol & Translat Sci, Nedlands, WA, Australia; [Hinder, Mark R.] Univ Tasmania, Sch Psychol Sci, Sensorimotor Neurosci & Ageing Res Lab, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Barnett, Michael] Sydney Neuroimaging Anal Ctr SNAC, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Barnett, Michael] Univ Sydney, Brain & Mind Ctr, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Tasmania; Menzies Institute for Medical Research; University of Western Australia; University of Tasmania; University of Sydney,"Makowiecki, K (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Menzies Inst Med Res, Hobart, Tas, Australia.",kalina.makowiecki@utas.edu.au,"Cullen, Carlie/HMD-5030-2023; Cullen, Carlie/J-7706-2014; Rodger, Jennifer/H-5735-2014","Cullen, Carlie/0000-0001-6929-6258; Rodger, Jennifer/0000-0003-3413-4229; Makowiecki, Kalina/0000-0003-4550-3819",Royal Hobart Hospital Research Foundation [C0026309]; Menzies Institute for Medical Research; MS Research Australia Postdoctoral Research Fellowship [19-0696]; Medical Protection Society of Tasmania (MPST) Foundation Grant; Australian Research Council Future Fellowship [FT150100406]; Medical Research Future Fund [EPCD0000008]; MS Research Australia/Macquarie Group Foundation Paired Fellowship [17-0223]; Australian Research Council [FT150100406] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Royal Hobart Hospital Research Foundation; Menzies Institute for Medical Research; MS Research Australia Postdoctoral Research Fellowship; Medical Protection Society of Tasmania (MPST) Foundation Grant; Australian Research Council Future Fellowship(Australian Research Council); Medical Research Future Fund(Medical Research Future Fund (MRFF)); MS Research Australia/Macquarie Group Foundation Paired Fellowship; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"This study was funded by Royal Hobart Hospital Research Foundation project grant (C0026309).

Objective: We presented a machine learning approach leveraging passive sensor data from smartphones and fitness trackers of people with MS to predict their health outcomes in a natural experiment during a state-mandated stay-at-home period due to a global pandemic. Methods: First, we extracted features that capture behavior changes due to the stay-at-home order. Then, we adapted and applied an existing algorithm to these behavior-change features to predict the presence of depression, high global MS symptom burden, severe fatigue, and poor sleep quality during the stay-at-home period. Results: Using data collected between November 2019 and May 2020, the algorithm detected depression with an accuracy of 82.5% (65% improvement over baseline; F-1-score: 0.84), high global MS symptom burden with an accuracy of 90% (39% improvement over baseline; F-1-score: 0.93), severe fatigue with an accuracy of 75.5% (22% improvement over baseline; F-1-score: 0.80), and poor sleep quality with an accuracy of 84% (28% improvement over baseline; F-1-score: 0.84). Conclusions: Our approach could help clinicians better triage patients with MS and potentially other chronic neurological disorders for interventions and aid patient self-monitoring in their own environment, particularly during extraordinarily stressful circumstances such as pandemics, which would cause drastic behavior changes.","[Chikersal, Prerna; Goel, Mayank] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Venkatesh, Shruthi; Masown, Karman; Walker, Elizabeth; Quraishi, Danyal; Xia, Zongqi] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Neurol, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Dey, Anind] Univ Washington, Informat Sch, Seattle, WA USA; [Xia, Zongqi] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Neurol, 3501 Fifth Ave,BST3,Suite 7014, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA",Carnegie Mellon University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Xia, ZQ (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Neurol, 3501 Fifth Ave,BST3,Suite 7014, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",zxia1@pitt.edu,,"Goel, Mayank/0000-0003-1237-7545; Walker, Elizabeth/0000-0002-6294-1098; Quraishi, Danyal/0000-0002-4180-6049; Dey, Anind K./0000-0002-3004-0770; Venkatesh, Shruthi/0000-0001-9113-0502",Department of Defense [CDMRP MS190178],Department of Defense(United States Department of Defense),"Acknowledgments We would like to thank our undergraduate research assistants: Man Jun (John) Han, Dong Yun Lee, Kasey Park, Phoebe Soong, and Christine Wu, for helping us monitor participant compliance throughout the data collection process.

A possible way to quantify this feature is to use acceleration data measured by a sensor located on the lower trunk. The most common approach calculates a symmetry index starting from the autocorrelation function, aiming to measure the divergence in motion of the left and right sides of the body. The various methods proposed to implement this approach are based on nonlinear and discontinuous functions, and the interpretation of their output is far from straightforward. The aim of this study was to propose a linear and easier to interpret quantification measure for gait asymmetry. The proposed measure was tested on data from healthy controls and from patients with Multiple Sclerosis and Parkinson's Disease, and it was shown to negate the flaws present in previous methods and to provide more directly interpretable results.","[van Gelder, Linda Maria Adriana; Angelini, Lorenza; Buckley, Ellen E.; Mazza, Claudia] Univ Sheffield, Dept Mech Engn, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; Univ Sheffield, Insigneo Inst In Silico Med, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield; University of Sheffield,"van Gelder, LMA (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Dept Mech Engn, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.",l.vangelder@sheffield.ac.uk; l.angelini@sheffield.ac.uk; e.e.buckley@sheffield.ac.uk; c.mazza@sheffield.ac.uk,"Buckley, Ellen/HMV-0426-2023","van Gelder, Linda/0000-0002-4124-2052; Mazza, Claudia/0000-0002-5215-1746; Angelini, Lorenza/0000-0002-4763-7717","NIHR through the Sheffield Biomedical Research Centre (BRC) [IS-BRC-1215-20017]; European Union [IMI22017-13-7-820820]; UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/K03877X/1, EP/S032940/1]; EPSRC [EP/K03877X/1, EP/S032940/1] Funding Source: UKRI",NIHR through the Sheffield Biomedical Research Centre (BRC); European Union(European Commission); UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"This study was co-funded by the NIHR through the Sheffield Biomedical Research Centre (BRC, grant number IS-BRC-1215-20017), by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme and EFPIA via the Innovative Medicine Initiative 2 (Mobilise-D project, grant number IMI22017-13-7-820820), and the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (Multisim and MultiSim2 projects, grant numbers EP/K03877X/1 and EP/S032940/1, respectively).

Wearable devices including inertial measurement units (IMUs) can overcome these limitations by quantifying digital mobility outcomes (DMOs) both during supervised structured assessments and in real-world conditions. The validity of IMU-based methods in the real-world, however, is still limited in patient populations. Rigorous validation procedures should cover the device metrological verification, the validation of the algorithms for the DMOs computation specifically for the population of interest and in daily life situations, and the users' perspective on the device. Methods and analysis This protocol was designed to establish the technical validity and patient acceptability of the approach used to quantify digital mobility in the real world by Mobilise-D, a consortium funded by the European Union (EU) as part of the Innovative Medicine Initiative, aiming at fostering regulatory approval and clinical adoption of DMOs. After defining the procedures for the metrological verification of an IMU-based device, the experimental procedures for the validation of algorithms used to calculate the DMOs are presented. These include laboratory and real-world assessment in 120 participants from five groups: healthy older adults; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, proximal femoral fracture and congestive heart failure. DMOs extracted from the monitoring device will be compared with those from different reference systems, chosen according to the contexts of observation. Questionnaires and interviews will evaluate the users' perspective on the deployed technology and relevance of the mobility assessment. Ethics and dissemination The study has been granted ethics approval by the centre's committees (London-Bloomsbury Research Ethics committee; Helsinki Committee, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Centre; Medical Faculties of The University of Tubingen and of the University of Kiel). Data and algorithms will be made publicly available.","[Mazza, Claudia; Bonci, Tecla; Buckley, Ellen; Ciravegna, Fabio; Ireson, Neil; Lanfranchi, Vitaveska; Scott, Kirsty; Van Gelder, Linda] Univ Sheffield, INSIGNE Inst Silico Med, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Mazza, Claudia; Bonci, Tecla; Buckley, Ellen; Scott, Kirsty; Van Gelder, Linda] Univ Sheffield, Dept Mech Engn, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Alcock, Lisa; Del Din, Silvia; Kirk, Cameron; Mico-Amigo, M.

We also deal with methodological issues that may occur when conducting such measurements, and explore to what extent GPS-measured outdoor walking capacities (maximal walking distance [MWDGPS] and usual walking speed) could be related to traditional functional outcomes (6-min total walking distance) in people with MS. Eighteen people with MS, with an Expanded Disability Status Scale score <= 6, completed a 6-min walking test and an outdoor walking session (60 min maximum) at usual pace during which participants were wearing a DG100 GPS receiver and could perform several walking bouts. Among the 12 participants with valid data (i.e., who correctly completed the outdoor session with no spurious GPS signals that could prevent the detection of the occurrence of a walking/stopping bout), the median (90% confidence interval, CI) outdoor walking speed was 2.52 km/h (2.17; 2.93). Ten participants (83% (56; 97)) had >= 1 stop during the session. Among these participants, the median of MWDGPS was 410 m (226; 1350), and 40% (15; 70) did not reach their MWDGPS during the first walking bout. Spearman correlations of MWDGPS and walking speed with 6-min total walking distance were, respectively, 0.19 (-0.41; 0.95) and 0.66 (0.30; 1.00).

Furthermore, the aim was to assess if an improvement in self-reported disability was related to an increase in objectively measured physical activity and if an aggravation in self-reported disability was related to a decrease in physical activity. Seventy patients with either multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, rheumatoid arthritis or stroke receiving free of charge physiotherapy were tested at baseline and 1 year later. Disability was measured with the self-reported modified Ranking Scale-9 Questionnaire and physical activity was objectively measured using tri-axial accelerometry. Neither self-reported disability nor physical activity changed among patients receiving 1 year of free of charge physiotherapy at group level. Furthermore, self-reported change of disability was not expressed with changes in objectively measured physical activity, indicating that the two measures represent two different constructs.","[Tonning, Lisa U.; Mechlenburg, Inger] Aarhus Univ Hosp, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Aarhus, Denmark; [Tonning, Lisa U.; Mechlenburg, Inger; Christiansen, David H.; Naess-Schmidt, Erhard] Aarhus Univ, Dept Clin Med, Aarhus, Denmark; [Christiansen, David H.] Reg Hosp West Jutland, Danish Ramazzini Ctr, Dept Occupat Med, Herning, Denmark; [Andersen, Nils-Bo, V] Primary Hlth Care & Qual Improvement, Viborg, Denmark; [Stabel, Henriette H.; Pedersen, Asger R.; Nielsen, Jorgen F.; Naess-Schmidt, Erhard] Hammel Neurorehabil Ctr, Hammel, Denmark; [Stabel, Henriette H.; Pedersen, Asger R.; Nielsen, Jorgen F.; Naess-Schmidt, Erhard] Univ Res Clin, Hammel, Denmark; [Grimm, Bernd] Luxembourg Inst Hlth, Human Mot Orthopaed Sports Med Digital Methods HO, Strassen, Luxembourg",Aarhus University; Aarhus University; Luxembourg Institute of Health,"Tonning, LU (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ Hosp, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Aarhus, Denmark.;Tonning, LU (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Clin Med, Aarhus, Denmark.",lisatoenning@clin.au.dk,"Christiansen, David Høyrup/ABE-7118-2021; Mechlenburg, Inger/AAP-8454-2021; Naess-Schmidt, Erhard/E-8425-2019","Christiansen, David Høyrup/0000-0001-7458-3921; Mechlenburg, Inger/0000-0001-5432-8691; Tonning, Lisa Urup/0000-0003-4666-4622; Nielsen, Jorgen Feldbaek/0000-0001-5339-171X; Naess-Schmidt, Erhard/0000-0002-2539-0362",Fysioterapipraksisfonden; Soster; Verner Lipperts Foundation,Fysioterapipraksisfonden; Soster; Verner Lipperts Foundation,This study was supported by Fysioterapipraksisfonden and Soster and Verner Lipperts Foundation.,,19,0,0,1,1,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2624-9367,,FRONT SPORTS ACT LIV,Front.

To overcome travel restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic, consumer-based technology was rapidly deployed to the smartphones of individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) participating in a 12-month exercise trial. The aim of the project was to determine the feasibility of utilizing a combined synchronous and asynchronous self-administered smartphone application to characterize PD symptoms. Methods. A synchronous video virtual visit was completed for the administration of virtual Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III (vMDS-UPDRS III). Participants asynchronously completed a mobile application consisting of a measure of upper extremity bradykinesia (Finger Tapping Test) and information processing. Results. Twenty-three individuals completed the assessments. The mean vMDS-UPDRS III was 23.65 +/- 8.56 points. On average, the nwnber of taps was significantly greater for the less affected limb, 97.96 +/- 17.77 taps, compared to the more affected, 89.33 +/- 18.66 taps (p = 0.025) with a significantly greater number of freezing episodes for the more affected limb (p < 0.05). Correlation analyses indicated the number of errors and the number of freezing episodes were significantly related to clinical ratings of vMDS-UPDRS III bradykinesia (Rho = 0.44, p < 0.01; R = 0.43, p < 0.01, resp.) and finger tapping performance (Rho = 0.31, p = 0.03; Rho = 0.32, p = 0.03, resp.). Discussion. The objective characterization of bradykinesia, akinesia, and nonmotor function and their relationship with clinical disease metrics indicate smartphone technology provides a remote method of characterizing important aspects of PD performance. While theoretical and position papers have been published on the potential of telemedicine to aid in the management of PD, this report translates the theory into a viable reality.","[Alberts, Jay L.; Koop, Mandy Miller; Penko, Amanda L.; Rosenfeldt, Anson B.] Cleveland Clin, Lerner Res Inst, Dept Biomed Engn, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Alberts, Jay L.; Fernandez, Hubert H.; Shook, Steven; Machado, Andre] Cleveland Clin, Ctr Neurol Restorat, Neurol Inst, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [McGinley, Marisa P.; Bermel, Robert A.] Cleveland Clin, Neurol Inst, Mellen Ctr Multiple Sclerosis, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Fernandez, Hubert H.; Machado, Andre] Cleveland Clin, Lerner Coll Med, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA",Cleveland Clinic Foundation; Cleveland Clinic Foundation; Cleveland Clinic Foundation; Case Western Reserve University; Cleveland Clinic Foundation,"Alberts, JL (corresponding author), Cleveland Clin, Lerner Res Inst, Dept Biomed Engn, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.;Alberts, JL (corresponding author), Cleveland Clin, Ctr Neurol Restorat, Neurol Inst, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.",albertj@ccf.org; koopm@ccf.org; mcginlm@ccf.org; penkoa@ccf.org; fernanh@ccf.org; shooks@ccf.org; bermelr@ccf.org; machada@ccf.org; rosenfa2@ccf.org,"Shook, Steven/AAA-9447-2022","Shook, Steven/0000-0001-7244-6878; Rosenfeldt, Anson/0000-0001-5468-8208; Bermel, Robert/0000-0003-2334-6883; McGinley, Marisa/0000-0002-7463-6787",Davis Phinney Foundation [DPF1808AR]; Edward F. and Barbara A.

Regularly quantifying these mobility limitations can be used to measure disease progression and the effect of treatment. This information can be used to provide a more individualized treatment. Inertial measurement units (IMUs) can be utilized to quantify mobility in different contexts. However, algorithms are required to extract valuable parameters out of the raw IMU data. These algorithms need to be validated to make sure that they extract the features they should extract. This validation should be performed per disease since different mobility limitations or symptoms can influence the performance of an algorithm in different ways. Therefore, this dataset contains data from both healthy subjects and patients with neurological diseases (Parkinson's disease, stroke, multiple sclerosis, chronic low back pain). The full bodies of 167 subjects were measured with IMUs and an optical motion capture (reference) system.

Upon axonal injury, the neurofilament light chain (NF-L) is released into the interstitial fluid and eventually reaches the cerebrospinal fluid and blood. Therefore, NF-L is emerging as a biomarker of neurological disorders, including neurodegenerative dementia, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis. It is challenging to quantify NF-L in bodily fluids due to its low levels. This work reports the detection of NF-L in aqueous solutions with an organic electronic device. The biosensor is based on the electrolyte-gated organic field-effect transistor (EGOFET) architecture and can quantify NF-L down to sub-pM levels; thanks to modification of the device gate with anti-NF-L antibodies imparted with potentially controlled orientation. The response is fitted to the Guggenheim-Anderson-De Boer adsorption model to describe NF-L adsorption at the gate/electrolyte interface, to consider the formation of a strongly adsorbed protein layer bound to the antibody and the formation of weakly bound NF-L multilayers, an interpretation which is also backed up by morphological characterization via atomic force microscopy. The label-free, selective, and rapid response makes this EGOFET biosensor a promising tool for the diagnosis and monitoring of neuronal damages through the detection of NF-L in physio-pathological ranges.","[Solodka, Kateryna; Berto, Marcello; Bortolotti, Carlo A.; Biscarini, Fabio; Pinti, Marcello] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dept Life Sci, Via Campi 103, I-41125 Modena, Italy; [Ferraro, Diana] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dept Biomed Metab & Neural Sci, Via Campi 287, I-41125 Modena, Italy; [Menozzi, Claudia] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dept Phys Informat & Math, Via Campi 213-A, I-41125 Modena, Italy; [Borsari, Marco] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dept Chem & Geol Sci, Via Campi 103, I-41125 Modena, Italy; [Biscarini, Fabio] Ist Italiano Tecnol, Ctr Translat Neurophysiol, Via Fossato Mortara 17-19, I-44121 Ferrara, Italy",Universita di Modena e Reggio Emilia; Universita di Modena e Reggio Emilia; Universita di Modena e Reggio Emilia; Universita di Modena e Reggio Emilia; Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia - IIT,"Bortolotti, CA; Pinti, M (corresponding author), Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dept Life Sci, Via Campi 103, I-41125 Modena, Italy.",carloaugusto.bortolotti@unimore.it; marcello.pinti@unimore.it,"Bortolotti, Carlo A/K-8421-2014; Pinti, Marcello/C-9351-2015; Biscarini, Fabio/I-6814-2012","Bortolotti, Carlo A/0000-0002-5701-5727; Pinti, Marcello/0000-0001-9118-1262; Biscarini, Fabio/0000-0001-6648-5803",European Union [813863],European Union(European Commission),This project received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement no. 813863.,,60,0,0,7,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2196-7350,,,ADV MATER INTERFACES,Adv.

Here, we posed 5 questions: 1) How many weeks of VTfb training are required to obtain the best short-term carry over effect (CoE) with VTfb? 2) How long does the CoE last once VTfb training terminates? 3) Is the benefit similar for stance and gait? 4) Is position or velocity based VTfb more effective in reducing trunk sway? 5) Do patients' subjective assessments of balance control improve? Methods: Balance control of 16 MS patients was measured with gyroscopes at the lower trunk. The gyroscopes drove directionally active VTfb in a head-band. Patients trained twice per week with VTfb for 4 weeks to determine when balance control with and without VTfb stopped improving. Thereafter, weekly assessments without VTfb over 4 weeks and at 6 months determined when CoEs ended. Results: A 20% improvement in balance to normal levels occurred with VTfb. Short term CoEs improved from 15 to 20% (p < 0.001). Medium term (1-4 weeks) CoEs were constant at 19% (p < 0.001). At 6 months improvement was not significant, 9%. Most improvement was for lateral sway. Equal improvement occurred when angle position or velocity drove VTfb. Subjectively, balance improvements peaked after 3 weeks of training (32%, p < 0.05). Conclusions: 3-4 weeks VTfb training yields clinically relevant sway reductions and subjective improvements for MS patients during stance and gait. The CoEs lasted at least 1 month. Velocity-based VTfb was equally effective as position-based VTfb.","[Allum, J. H. J.; Rust, H.

Human motion tracking is also used extensively for sporting technique and performance analysis as well as for work life ergonomics evaluations. Wearable inertial sensors (e.g., accelerometers, gyroscopes and/or magnetometers) are frequently employed because they are easy to mount and can be used in real life, out-of-the-lab-settings, as opposed to video-based lab setups. These distributed sensors cannot, however, measure relative distances between sensors, and are also cumbersome when it comes to calibration and drift compensation. In this study, we tested an ultrasonic time-of-flight sensor for measuring relative limb-to-limb distance, and we developed a combined inertial sensor and ultrasonic time-of-flight wearable measurement system. The aim was to investigate if ultrasonic time-of-flight sensors can supplement inertial sensor-based motion tracking by providing relative distances between inertial sensor modules. We found that the ultrasonic time-of-flight measurements reflected expected walking motion patterns. The stride length estimates derived from ultrasonic time-of-flight measurements corresponded well with estimates from validated inertial sensors, indicating that the inclusion of ultrasonic time-of-flight measurements could be a feasible approach for improving inertial sensor-only systems. Our prototype was able to measure both inertial and time-of-flight measurements simultaneously and continuously, but more work is necessary to merge the complementary approaches to provide more accurate and more detailed human motion tracking.","[Jahren, Silje Ekroll; Aakvaag, Niels; Strisland, Frode; Vogl, Andreas; Liberale, Alessandro; Liverud, Anders E.] SINTEF Digital, N-0373 Oslo, Norway; [Strisland, Frode] Univ Oslo, Dept Phys, N-0371 Oslo, Norway",SINTEF; University of Oslo,"Liverud, AE (corresponding author), SINTEF Digital, N-0373 Oslo, Norway.",esilje@gmail.com; niels.aakvaag@sintef.no; frode.strisland@sintef.no; andreas.vogl@sintef.no; alessandro.liberale@sintef.no; anders.liverud@sintef.no,,"Vogl, Andreas/0000-0002-1013-0816; Strisland, Frode/0000-0003-4628-3280; Liverud, Anders Erik/0000-0002-9022-4272; Liberale, Alessandro/0000-0003-3562-5679; Jahren, Silje Ekroll/0000-0003-3931-5141",Electronic Component Systems for European Leadership Joint Undertaking [737487]; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program,Electronic Component Systems for European Leadership Joint Undertaking; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program,"This project has received funding from the Electronic Component Systems for European Leadership Joint Undertaking under grant agreement No 737487.

Oxidants and mitochondrial dysfunction have been suggested as the main causes of ODC damage during neuroinflammation as observed in multiple sclerosis (MS). Nonetheless, the dynamics of this process remain unclear, thus hindering the design of neuroprotective therapeutic strategies. To decipher the spatio-temporal pattern of oxidative damage and dysfunction of ODC mitochondria in vivo, we created a novel mouse model in which ODCs selectively express the ratiometric H2O2 biosensor mito-roGFP2-Orp1 allowing for quantification of redox changes in their mitochondria. Using 2-photon imaging of the exposed spinal cord, we observed significant mitochondrial oxidation in ODCs upon induction of the MS model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). This redox change became already apparent during the preclinical phase of EAE prior to CNS infiltration of inflammatory cells. Upon clinical EAE development, mitochondria oxidation remained detectable and was associated with a significant impairment in organelle density and morphology. These alterations correlated with the proximity of ODCs to inflammatory lesions containing activated microglia/macrophages. During the chronic progression of EAE, ODC mitochondria maintained an altered morphology, but their oxidant levels decreased to levels observed in healthy mice. Taken together, our study implicates oxidative stress in ODC mitochondria as a novel pre-clinical sign of MS-like inflammation and demonstrates that evolving redox and morphological changes in mitochondria accompany ODC dysfunction during neuroinflammation.","[Steudler, Jasmin; Ecott, Timothy; Ivan, Daniela C.; Bouillet, Elisa; Walthert, Sabrina; Berve, Kristina; Engelhardt, Britta; Locatelli, Giuseppe] Univ Bern, Theodor Kocher Inst, Freiestr 1,Postach 938, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Dick, Tobias P.] German Canc Res Ctr, Div Redox Regulat, DKFZ ZMBH Alliance, Heidelberg, Germany",University of Bern; Helmholtz Association; German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ),"Locatelli, G (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Theodor Kocher Inst, Freiestr 1,Postach 938, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.",giuseppe.locatelli@novartis.com,,"Locatelli, Giuseppe/0000-0002-2179-4407",Betty and David Koetser Foundation; Ruth & Arthur Scherbarth Foundation; Schweizerische Multiple Sklerose Gesellschaft [2021-07]; Theodore Ott Fund [07/18],Betty and David Koetser Foundation; Ruth & Arthur Scherbarth Foundation; Schweizerische Multiple Sklerose Gesellschaft; Theodore Ott Fund,"Betty and David Koetser Foundation; Ruth & Arthur Scherbarth Foundation; Schweizerische Multiple Sklerose Gesellschaft, Grant/Award Number: 2021-07; Theodore Ott Fund, Grant/Award Number: 07/18",,91,1,1,4,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0894-1491,1098-1136,,GLIA,Glia,NOV,2022,70,11,,,,,2045,2061,,10.1002/glia.24235,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/glia.24235,,JUN 2022,17,Neurosciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Neurosciences & Neurology,4M0LP,35762739,Green Published,,,2023-02-20,WOS:000817201200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

To this end, we attended DBS programming sessions of a MS patient and intention tremor was effectively quantified by acceleration amplitude and frequency. A new method is introduced which results in the generation of therapeutic maps for a systematic review of the programming procedure in DBS. The maps visualise the combination of tremor acceleration ered to the brain and possible side effects. Therapeutic maps have not yet been employed and could lead to a certain degree of standardisation for more objective decisions about DBS settings. The maps provide a base for future research on visualisation tools to assist physicians who frequently encounter patients for DBS therapy.","[Bremm, Rene Peter; Berthold, Christophe; Hertel, Frank] Ctr Hosp Luxembourg, Natl Dept Neurosurg, 4 Rue Nicolas Ernest Barbie, L-1210 Luxembourg, Luxembourg; [Bremm, Rene Peter; Hertel, Frank] Univ Luxembourg, Luxembourg Ctr Syst Biomed, Intervent Neurosci, 2 Ave Univ, L-4365 Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg; [Kruger, Rejko] Univ Luxembourg, Luxembourg Ctr Syst Biomed, Translat Neurosci, Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg; [Koch, Klaus Peter] Trier Univ Appl Sci, Dept Elect Engn, Trier, Germany; [Goncalves, Jorge] Univ Luxembourg, Luxembourg Ctr Syst Biomed, Syst Control, Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg",Luxembourg Hospital Center; University of Luxembourg; University of Luxembourg; University of Luxembourg,"Bremm, RP (corresponding author), Ctr Hosp Luxembourg, Natl Dept Neurosurg, 4 Rue Nicolas Ernest Barbie, L-1210 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.;Bremm, RP (corresponding author), Univ Luxembourg, Luxembourg Ctr Syst Biomed, Intervent Neurosci, 2 Ave Univ, L-4365 Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg.",bremmrp@outlook.com,"Goncalves, Jorge M/GRN-8101-2022; Goncalves, Jorge/GYD-3756-2022","Goncalves, Jorge M/0000-0002-5228-6165; Krueger, Rejko/0000-0003-4258-6241",Fonds National de la Recherche Luxembourg [10086156],Fonds National de la Recherche Luxembourg(Luxembourg National Research Fund),"This work was supported by the Fonds National de la Recherche Luxembourg with an PhD Grant (10086156, Rene Peter Bremm).

Current techniques either have low resolutions or are dependent on the estimation of parameters that are not measurable. The Omega plot method, on the other hand, provides a direct way for determining k(ex) independent of the agent concentration. However, it cannot be used for in vivo studies without some modification due to the contributions from the water signal. In vivo tissue proton exchange rate (k(ex)) MRI, based on the direct saturation (DS) removed Omega plot, quantifies the weighted average of k(ex) of the endogenous tissue metabolites. This technique has been successfully employed for imaging the variation in the k(ex) of ex vivo phantoms, as well as in vivo human brains in healthy subjects, and stroke or multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. In this paper, we present a brief review of the methods used for k(ex) imaging with a focus on the development of in vivo k(ex) MRI technique based on the DS-removed Omega plot. We then review the recent clinical studies utilizing this technique for better characterizing brain lesions. We also outline technical challenges for the presented technique and discuss its prospects for detecting tissue microenvironmental changes under oxidative stress.","[Shaghaghi, Mehran; Cai, Kejia] Univ Illinois, Dept Radiol, Chicago, IL 60612 USA; [Cai, Kejia] Univ Illinois, Dept Biomed Engn, Chicago, IL 60607 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital,"Cai, KJ (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Radiol, Chicago, IL 60612 USA.;Cai, KJ (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Biomed Engn, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.",kcai@uic.edu,,"Shaghaghi, Mehran/0000-0002-0278-9936",,,,,95,1,1,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2079-6374,,BIOSENSORS-BASEL,Biosensors-Basel,OCT,2022,12,10,,,,,,,815,10.3390/bios12100815,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/bios12100815,,,16,"Chemistry, Analytical; Nanoscience & Nanotechnology; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Instruments & Instrumentation,5O1NL,36290953,gold,,,2023-02-20,WOS:000872248400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Objectives: The current study extended previous research by examining the association between device-measured PA and cognitive outcomes based on neuropsychological testing among persons with MS who were pre-screened for cognitive impairment. Methods: The sample included 60 persons with MS who underwent cognitive performance tests (SDMT, CVLT-II, and BVMT-R) and wore an accelerometer on an elastic waist band during the waking hours of a 7-day period for measuring PA across the activity spectrum (sedentary behavior, light PA [LPA], and moderate-to vigorous PA [MVPA]. The data were analyzed with bivariate and partial Spearman rank-order correlations in using SPSS. Results: MVPA had statistically significant correlations with SDMT, CVLT-II, and BVMT-R. LPA had a statistically significant correlation with SDMT, but not CVLT-II or BVMT-R. Sedentary behavior did not demonstrate statistically significant correlations with any cognitive outcomes. MVPA had statistically significant correlations with SDMT, after controlling for age, sex, education, and disability status. All other correlations were not statistically significant after controlling for covariates. Conclusion: This initial cross-sectional data supports the design of PA interventions that target ambulatory PA as a form of MVPA for managing MS-related CPS impairment in MS.","[Motl, Robert W.] Univ Illinois, Dept Kinesiol & Nutr, 1919 W Taylor St, Chicago, IL 60612 USA; [Sandroff, Brian M.] Kessler Fdn, Ctr Neuropsychol & Neurosci Res, West Orange, NJ USA; [Benedict, Ralph H.

This work describes the hardware, firmware and software updates of SISTINE, a telemonitoring system based on a pair of sensorized socks and a sensorized belt that is able to monitor physical quantities in real time such as plantar pressures and accelerations of the body segments. A pilot study on posture assessment involved 8 healthy participants recruited at the Foro Italico University of Rome. The center of pressure and related parameters, such as the confidence ellipse, were extracted and analysed from the SISTINE system and provided an indication of the effectiveness of the use of the devices in the analysis of posture.

Methods are motivated by two applications: (i) Diffusion tensor imaging measured at multiple visits along the corpus callosum of multiple sclerosis patients; and (ii) physical activity (PA) data measured by body-worn accelerometers for multiple days. An extensive simulation study indicates that model fitting and inference are accurate and much faster than existing approaches. Moreover, the proposed approach was the only one that was computationally feasible for the PA data application.

Clinical assessments for treatment adjustments and data-collection for pharmacological research often rely on subjective representations of functioning. Better phenotyping through digital applications may add unseen information and facilitate disentangling the clinical characteristics and impact of depression and its pharmacological treatment in everyday life. Researchers, physicians, and patients benefit from well-understood digital phenotyping approaches to assess the treatment efficacy and side-effects. This review discusses the current possibilities and pitfalls of wearables and technology for the assessment of the pharmacological treatment of depression. Their applications in the whole spectrum of treatment for depression, including diagnosis, treatment of an episode, and monitoring of relapse risk and prevention are discussed. Multiple aspects are to be considered, including concerns that come with collecting sensitive data and health recordings. Also, privacy and trust are addressed. Available applications range from questionnaire-like apps to objective assessment of behavioural patterns and promises in handling suicidality. Nonetheless, interpretation and integration of this high-resolution information with other phenotyping levels, remains challenging. This review provides a state-of-the-art description of wearables and technology in digital phenotyping for monitoring pharmacological treatment in depression, focusing on the challenges and opportunities of its application in clinical trials and research.Crown Copyright (c) 2022 Published by Elsevier B.V.

While there is currently no cure for this neurodegenerative disease, MS has become a highly manageable disease through treatment options like disease-modifying medications, that can help to control the symptoms and slow disease progression. Among them, interferon beta (IFN beta) therapy is a first-line treatment for MS but has shown to be only partially effective. Thus, it is important to identify biomarkers that aid in early identification of IFN beta responders. In this study, based on gene expression profiles from untreated and interferon treated patients from a publicly available dataset, we performed differential expression analysis and Pigengene network association (weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) and Bayesian networks modeling) in order to construct a high-confidence protein-protein (PPI) interaction network. Subsequently, aiming to find the most significant clustering modules and hub genes, we applied a number of topological analysis methods (cytoHubba plugin) followed by MCODE clustering algorithm. Our approach resulted in highly connected hub genes generating a reliable 21-hubgene signature that could predict the response of interferon beta (IFN beta) therapy in patients with MS. The 21-hub-gene signature showed high classification performance (Accuracy = 91,49%, Sensitivity = 94.55%, Specificity = 87.15%) demonstrating potential clinical benefit.","[Stavroula, Tsakaneli; Bei, Ekaterini S.; Zervakis, Michalis E.] Tech Univ Crete, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Khania, Greece",Technical University of Crete,"Stavroula, T (corresponding author), Tech Univ Crete, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Khania, Greece.",stsakaneli@tuc.gr; abei@tuc.gr; mzervakis@tuc.gr,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-6654-8791-7,,,,2022,,,,,,,,,,10.1109/BHI56158.2022.9926949,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/BHI56158.2022.9926949,,,5,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Medical Informatics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Medical Informatics,BU4DA,,,,,2023-02-20,WOS:000895865900098,View Full Record in Web of Science

Previous research identified population-level predictors through linear models and clinical data. This work explores the feasibility of predicting individual neurorehabilitation outcomes using machine learning, clinical data, and digital health metrics. Machine learning models were trained on clinical data and digital health metrics recorded pre-intervention in 11 pwMS. The dependent variables indicated whether pwMS considerably improved across the intervention, as defined by the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), Box and Block Test (BBT), or Nine Hole Peg Test (NHPT). Improvements in ARAT or BBT could be accurately predicted (88% and 83% accuracy) using only patient master data. Improvements in NHPT could be predicted with moderate accuracy (73%) and required knowledge about sensorimotor impairments. Assessing these with digital health metrics over clinical scales increased accuracy by 10%. Non-linear models improved accuracy for the BBT (+ 9%), but not for the ARAT (-1%) and NHPT (-2%). This work demonstrates the feasibility of predicting upper limb neurorehabilitation outcomes in pwMS, which justifies the development of more representative prediction models in the future. Digital health metrics improved the prediction of changes in hand control, thereby underlining their advanced sensitivity.","[Kanzler, Christoph M.; Gassert, Roger; Lambercy, Olivier] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Hlth Sci & Technol, Inst Robot & Intelligent Syst, Rehabil Engn Lab, BAA C 307-1,Lengghalde 5, CH-8008 Zurich, Switzerland; [Kanzler, Christoph M.] Singapore ETH Ctr, Campus Res Excellence & Technol Enterprise, Future Hlth Technol, Singapore, Singapore; [Lamers, Ilse; Feys, Peter] Hasselt Univ, Biomed Res Inst, Fac Med & Life Sci, Rehabil Res Ctr,REVAL,BIOMED, Hasselt, Belgium; [Lamers, Ilse] Rehabil & MS Ctr, Pelt, Belgium",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Hasselt University,"Kanzler, CM (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Hlth Sci & Technol, Inst Robot & Intelligent Syst, Rehabil Engn Lab, BAA C 307-1,Lengghalde 5, CH-8008 Zurich, Switzerland.;Kanzler, CM (corresponding author), Singapore ETH Ctr, Campus Res Excellence & Technol Enterprise, Future Hlth Technol, Singapore, Singapore.",christoph.kanzler@hest.ethz.ch,"Gassert, Roger/I-1591-2019","Gassert, Roger/0000-0002-6373-8518; Kanzler, Christoph M./0000-0003-1214-8347","Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich; European Union [688857]; Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation [15.0283-1]; National Research Foundation, Prime Minister's Office, Singapore under its Campus for Research Excellence and Technological Enterprise (CREATE) programme","Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich(ETH Zurich); European Union(European Commission); Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation; National Research Foundation, Prime Minister's Office, Singapore under its Campus for Research Excellence and Technological Enterprise (CREATE) programme(National Research Foundation, Singapore)","Open access funding provided by Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich.

The human gut bacterium Parabacteroides distasonis (P. distasonis) is positively associated with diseases such as obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and multiple sclerosis with reduced cell counts in these diseases and is thus a promising potential probiotic bacterium for future microbial supplementation. In this paper we report on the evolution of a specific polyclonal aptamer library by the fluorescence based FluCell-SELEX directed against whole cells of P. distasonis that specifically and efficiently binds and labels P. distasonis. The aptamer library showed high binding affinity and was suited to quantitatively discriminate P. distasonis from other prominent gut bacteria also in mixtures. We believe that this library against a promising probiotic bacterium as a prototype may open new routes towards the development of novel biosensors for the easy and efficient quantitative monitoring of microbial abundance in human microbiomes in general.","[Xing, Hu; Kissmann, Ann-Kathrin; Raber, Heinz Fabian; Kramer, Markus; Amann, Valerie; Kohn, Kathrin; Rosenau, Frank] Ulm Univ, Inst Pharmaceut Biotechnol, Albert Einstein Allee 11, D-89081 Ulm, Germany; [Weil, Tanja; Rosenau, Frank] Max Planck Inst Polymer Res Mainz, Ackermannweg 10, D-55128 Mainz, Germany",Ulm University; Max Planck Society,"Rosenau, F (corresponding author), Ulm Univ, Inst Pharmaceut Biotechnol, Albert Einstein Allee 11, D-89081 Ulm, Germany.;Rosenau, F (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Polymer Res Mainz, Ackermannweg 10, D-55128 Mainz, Germany.",dolphinzyt2418@gmail.com; ann-kathrin.kissmann@uni-ulm.de; Heinz.Raber@uni-ulm.de; Markus-1.Kraemer@uni-ulm.de; Valerie.amann@uni-ulm.de; kathrin.kohn@uni-ul.de; weil@mpip-mainz.mpg.de; frank.rosenau@uni-ulm.de,,,"China Scholarship Council [202108080084]; Ministry of Science, Research and Arts of the state of Baden-Wurttemberg; Baden-Wurttemberg Stiftung [BiofMO_005]; European Union [686271]; Ministry of Science, Research and the Arts of Baden-Wurttemberg (MWK) [Forderkennzeichen: 7533-10-5-186A, 7533-10-5-190]","China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); Ministry of Science, Research and Arts of the state of Baden-Wurttemberg; Baden-Wurttemberg Stiftung; European Union(European Commission); Ministry of Science, Research and the Arts of Baden-Wurttemberg (MWK)","This work was supported by the China Scholarship Council (No.: 202108080084), the Ministry of Science, Research and Arts of the state of Baden-Wurttemberg in the framework of the PhD program: pharmaceutical biotechnology, the Baden-Wurttemberg Stiftung in the framework of Bioinspired material synthesis and Bio-funktionelle Materialien und Oberflachen (Nano-Mem-to-Tech, BiofMO_005), and the European Union project Horizon 2020 (No. 686271) in the framework AD-gut.

This scoping review provides an update on remote patient monitoring for neuropsychiatric disorders from recent publications and upcoming clinical trials.Methods: Publications (PubMed and ICHUSHI; published January 2010 to February 2021) and trials (ClinicalTrials.gov and Japanese registries; active or recruiting by March 2021) that assessed wearable devices for remote management and/or monitoring of patients with neuropsychiatric disorders were searched. The review focuses on disorders with >= 3 publications.Results: We identified 44 publications and 51 active or recruiting trials, mostly from 2019 or 2020. Research on digital devices was most common for Parkinson's disease (11 publications and 19 trials), primarily for monitoring motor symptoms and/or preventing falls. Other disorders (3-5 publications each) included epilepsy (electroencephalogram [EEG] and seizure prediction), sleep disorder (sleep outcomes and behavioral therapies), multiple sclerosis (physical activity and symptoms), depression (physical activity, symptoms, and behavioral therapies), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (symptoms). Very few studies focused on newly emerging technologies (e.g., in-ear EEG and portable oximeters), and few studies integrated remote symptom monitoring with telemedicine.Discussion: Currently, development of digital devices for daily symptom monitoring is focused on Parkinson's disease. For the diseases reviewed, studies mostly focused on physical activity rather than psychiatric or nonmotor symptoms. Although the validity and usefulness of many devices are established, models for implementing remote patient monitoring in telehealth settings have not been established.Conclusions: Verification of the clinical effectiveness of digital devices combined with telemedicine is needed to further advance remote patient care for neuropsychiatric disorders.","[Sakamaki, Tetsuo] Gunma Univ, Med Informat & Decis Sci, Grad Sch Med, Maebashi, Gumma, Japan; [Furusawa, Yoshihiko; Hayashi, Ayako; Fernandez, Jovelle] Takeda Pharmaceut Co Ltd, Japan Med Off, Tokyo, Japan; [Otsuka, Masaru] Takeda Pharmaceut Co Ltd, Enterprise Digital Lead, Tokyo, Japan",Gunma University; Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd; Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd,"Furusawa, Y (corresponding author), Takeda Pharmaceut Co Ltd, Japan Med Off, Chuo Ku, 1-1 Nihonbashi Honcho,2 Chome, Tokyo 1038668, Japan.",yoshihiko.furusawa@takeda.com,,,Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited,Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited(Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd),"This study was funded by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited.

We recruited twenty-five yoga instructors and twenty-five healthy control subjects to conduct the walking experiments and single-leg stance tests. Kinematic data were measured by attaching IMUs to the lower limbs and trunk. We assessed the asymmetry of swing phases during the normal-walk and tandem-walk tests with eyes open and closed, respectively. The subjects subsequently conducted four single-leg stance tests, including a single-leg stance on both legs with eyes open and closed. Two balance indexes regarding the angular velocities of the waist and chest were defined to assess postural stability. The gait asymmetry indexes of yoga instructors were significantly lower than those of the typically developed controls. Similarly, the yoga instructors had better body balance in all four single-leg stance tests. This study's findings suggest that yoga improves gait asymmetry and balance ability in healthy adults. In the future, further intervention studies could be conducted to confirm the effect of yoga training.","[Lin, Ang-Chieh; Lin, Tzu-Tung; Chen, Szu-Fu] Cheng Hsin Gen Hosp, Dept Phys Med & Rehabil, Taipei 112, Taiwan; [Tan, Yin-Keat; Pan, Wei-Ren; Shih, Chih-Jen; Wang, Fu-Cheng] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Taipei 10617, Taiwan; [Lee, Chun-Ju] Yogabija Studio, Taipei 106, Taiwan; [Chen, Szu-Fu] Natl Def Med Ctr, Dept Physiol & Biophys, Taipei 114, Taiwan",Cheng Hsin General Hospital; National Taiwan University; National Defense Medical Center,"Chen, SF (corresponding author), Cheng Hsin Gen Hosp, Dept Phys Med & Rehabil, Taipei 112, Taiwan.;Wang, FC (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.;Chen, SF (corresponding author), Natl Def Med Ctr, Dept Physiol & Biophys, Taipei 114, Taiwan.",szufuchen@yahoo.com.tw; fcw@ntu.edu.tw,,"WANG, FU-CHENG/0000-0001-5011-7934",,,,,38,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,DEC,2022,22,24,,,,,,,9683,10.3390/s22249683,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s22249683,,,19,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,7G9WE,36560050,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-02-20,WOS:000902863800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Mobile health technology is a possible avenue to provide fall risk assessment. The promise of this approach is dependent upon its usability. Objective: We aimed to determine the usability of a fall risk mobile health app and identify key technology development insights for aging adults who use wheeled devices. Methods: Two rounds (with 5 participants in each round) of usability testing utilizing an iterative design-evaluation process were performed. Participants completed use of the custom-designed fall risk app, Steady-Wheels. To quantify fall risk, the app led participants through 12 demographic questions and 3 progressively more challenging seated balance tasks. Once completed, participants shared insights on the app's usability through semistructured interviews and completion of the Systematic Usability Scale. Testing sessions were recorded and transcribed. Codes were identified within the transcriptions to create themes. Average Systematic Usability Scale scores were calculated for each round. Results: The first round of testing yielded 2 main themes: ease of use and flexibility of design. Systematic Usability Scale scores ranged from 72.5 to 97.5 with a mean score of 84.5 (SD 11.4). After modifications were made, the second round of testing yielded 2 new themes: app layout and clarity of instruction. Systematic Usability Scale scores improved in the second iteration and ranged from 87.5 to 97.5 with a mean score of 91.9 (SD 4.3). Conclusions: The mobile health app, Steady-Wheels, has excellent usability and the potential to provide adult wheeled device users with an easy-to-use, remote fall risk assessment tool. Characteristics that promoted usability were guided navigation, large text and radio buttons, clear and brief instructions accompanied by representative illustrations, and simple error recovery. Intuitive fall risk reporting was achieved through the presentation of a single number located on a color-coordinated continuum that delineated low, medium, and high risk.","[Frechette, Mikaela; Rice, Laura] Univ Illinois, Dept Kinesiol & Community Hlth, Urbana, IL USA; [Frechette, Mikaela] Univ Illinois, Siebel Ctr Design, Urbana, IL USA; [Fanning, Jason] Wake Forest Univ, Dept Hlth & Exercise Sci, Winston Salem, NC 27101 USA; [Hsieh, Katherine] Wake Forest Sch Med, Sect Gerontol & Geriatr Med, Dept Internal Med, Winston Salem, NC 27101 USA; [Rice, Laura; Sosnoff, Jacob] Univ Illinois, Illinois Multiple Sclerosis Res Collaborat, Urbana, IL USA; [Rice, Laura] Univ Illinois, Ctr Hlth Aging & Disabil, Urbana, IL USA; [Sosnoff, Jacob] Univ Kansas, Med Ctr, Dept Phys Therapy Rehabil Sci & Athlet Training, 3901 Rainbow Blvd, Kansas City, KS 66103 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Wake Forest University; Wake Forest University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Kansas; University of Kansas Medical Center,"Sosnoff, J (corresponding author), Univ Kansas, Med Ctr, Dept Phys Therapy Rehabil Sci & Athlet Training, 3901 Rainbow Blvd, Kansas City, KS 66103 USA.",jsosnoff@kumc.edu,,"Frechette, Mikaela/0000-0001-7967-833X; Rice, Laura/0000-0003-3902-1151; Fanning, Jason/0000-0002-5527-1698; Sosnoff, Jacob/0000-0002-0286-9207","National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research [90REGE0006-01-00]; MS Run the US Scholarship","National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research(United States Department of Health & Human Services); MS Run the US Scholarship","This work was supported by the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research (grant 90REGE0006-01-00).

Cerebellar vermin is critical for postural control. The cerebellum ensures the mapping of sensory information into temporally relevant motor commands. Mental imagery of gait involves intrinsically connected fronto-parietal networks comprising the cerebellum. Muscular activities in cerebellar patients show impaired timing of discharges, affecting the patterning of the synergies subserving locomotion. Ataxia of stance/gait is amongst the first cerebellar deficits in cerebellar disorders such as degenerative ataxias and is a disabling symptom with a high risk of falls. Prolonged discharges and increased muscle coactivation may be related to compensatory mechanisms and enhanced body sway, respectively. Essential tremor is frequently associated with mild gait ataxia. There is growing evidence for an important role of the cerebellar cortex in the pathogenesis of essential tremor. In multiple sclerosis, balance and gait are affected due to cerebellar and spinal cord involvement, as a result of disseminated demyelination and neurodegeneration impairing proprioception. In orthostatic tremor, patients often show mild-to-moderate limb and gait ataxia. The tremor generator is likely located in the posterior fossa. Tandem gait is impaired in the early stages of cerebellar disorders and may be particularly useful in the evaluation of pre-ataxic stages of progressive ataxias. Impaired inter-joint coordination and enhanced variability of gait temporal and kinetic parameters can be grasped by wearable devices such as accelerometers. Kinect is a promising low cost technology to obtain reliable measurements and remote assessments of gait. Deep learning methods are being developed in order to help clinicians in the diagnosis and decision-making process. Locomotor adaptation is impaired in cerebellar patients. Coordinative training aims to improve the coordinative strategy and foot placements across strides, cerebellar patients benefiting from intense rehabilitation therapies. Robotic training is a promising approach to complement conventional rehabilitation and neuromodulation of the cerebellum. Wearable dynamic orthoses represent a potential aid to assist gait. The panel of experts agree that the understanding of the cerebellar contribution to gait control will lead to a better management of cerebellar ataxias in general and will likely contribute to use gait parameters as robust biomarkers of future clinical trials.","[Cabaraux, Pierre; Manto, Mario] CHU Charleroi, Unite Ataxies Cerebelleuses, Dept Neurol, Charleroi, Belgium; [Agrawal, Sunil K.] Columbia Univ, New York, NY USA; [Cai, Huaying] Zhejiang Univ, Sir Run Run Shaw Hosp, Neurosci Ctr, Sch Med,Dept Neurol, Hangzhou 310016, Peoples R China; [Calabro, Rocco Salvatore] IRCCS Ctr Neurolesi Bonino Pulejo, Messina, Italy; [Carlo, Casali; Serrao, Mariano] Univ Rome Sapienza, Dept Med Surg Sci & Biotechnol, Latina, Italy; [Loic, Damm] Univ Montpellier, IMT Mines Ales, EuroMov Digital Hlth Mot, Montpellier, France; [Sarah, Doss; Torres-Russotto, Diego] Univ Nebraska Med Ctr, Dept Neurol Sci, Omaha, NE USA; [Habas, Christophe] Univ Versailles St Quentin, Versailles, France; [Habas, Christophe] Ctr Hosp Natl 15 20, Serv NeuroImagerie, Paris, France; [Horn, Anja K.

Wearable inertial sensors offer the advantages of providing accurate, objective, and reliable measures of gait while streamlining walk test administration. The aim of this study was to develop an inertial sensor-based algorithm to estimate the total distance walked using older subjects with impaired fasting glucose (Study I), and to test the generalizability of the proposed algorithm in patients with Multiple Sclerosis (Study II). All subjects wore two inertial sensors (Opals by Clario-APDM Wearable Technologies) on their feet. The walking distance algorithm was developed based on 108 older adults in Study I performing a 400 m walk test along a 20 m straight walkway. The validity of the algorithm was tested using a 6-minute walk test (6MWT) in two sub-studies of Study II with different lengths of a walkway, 15 m (Study II-A, n = 24) and 20 m (Study II-B, n = 22), respectively. The start and turn around points were marked with lines on the floor while smaller horizontal lines placed every 1 m served to calculate the manual distance walked (ground truth). The proposed algorithm calculates the forward distance traveled during each step as the change in the horizontal position from each foot-flat period to the subsequent foot-flat period. The total distance walked is then computed as the sum of walk distances for each stride, including turns. The proposed algorithm achieved an average absolute error rate of 1.92% with respect to a fixed 400 m distance for Study I. The same algorithm achieved an absolute error rate of 4.17% and 3.21% with respect to an averaged manual distance for 6MWT in Study II-A and Study II-B, respectively. These results demonstrate the potential of an inertial sensor-based algorithm to estimate a total distance walked with good accuracy with respect to the manual, clinical standard. Further work is needed to test the generalizability of the proposed algorithm with different administrators and populations, as well as larger diverse cohorts.","[Shah, Vrutangkumar V.; Arpan, Ishu; Mancini, Martina; Carlson-Kuhta, Patricia; Horak, Fay B.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Neurol, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Pk Rd, Portland, OR 97239 USA; [Curtze, Carolin] Univ Nebraska, Dept Biomech, 6001 Dodge St, Omaha, NE 68182 USA; [Sowalsky, Kristen; El-Gohary, Mahmoud; Horak, Fay B.; McNames, James] APDM Wearable Technol, 2828 S Corbett Ave,Ste 135, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [McNames, James] Portland State Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, 1825 SW Broadway, Portland, OR 97201 USA",Oregon Health & Science University; University of Nebraska System; Portland State University,"Shah, VV (corresponding author), Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Neurol, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Pk Rd, Portland, OR 97239 USA.",shahvr@ohsu.edu; ccurtze@unomaha.edu; kristen.sowalsky@ert.com; arpan@ohsu.edu; mancinim@ohsu.edu; carlsonp@ohsu.edu; mahmoud.el-gohary@ert.com; horakf@ohsu.edu; james.mcnames@ert.com,,"Horak, Fay/0000-0001-7704-5459; Curtze, Carolin/0000-0001-5394-4628; Carlson-Kuhta, Patricia/0000-0002-5794-4155","NIH [5IK2CX000729]; DoD [MS170133]; Collins Medical Trust (Portland, OR); Medical Research Foundation (Portland, OR); Center of Biomedical Research Excellence grant from NIGMS/NIH [P20GM109090]","NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); DoD(United States Department of Defense); Collins Medical Trust (Portland, OR); Medical Research Foundation (Portland, OR); Center of Biomedical Research Excellence grant from NIGMS/NIH","This study was supported by NIH grant #5IK2CX000729, DoD grant #MS170133, the Collins Medical Trust (Portland, OR), and the Medical Research Foundation (Portland, OR).

Improved gait is one of the leading therapy goals in multiple sclerosis. A plethora of clinical timed trials and state-of-the-art technology-based approaches are available to assess gait performance. Objectives. To examine what aspects of gait react to inpatient rehabilitation in MS and which parameters should be best assessed. Design. In this longitudinal study, we examined the performance of 76 patients with MS to shed further light on factors influencing gait, associations between tests, and the reaction to inpatient rehabilitation during an average time span of 16 d. Setting. Private specialist clinic for inpatient neurorehabilitation. Main Outcome Measures. Clinical walk tests (timed 25-foot walk test at normal pace, maximum pace over 10 m or 6 min) and IMU-based measures of movement smoothness. Results. All gait parameters were strongly intercorrelated (all p<0.05), and a model multiple linear regression for the 6MWT revealed short distance velocity (10 m) and movement smoothness as predictors in a strong model (R-adjusted(2) 0.75, p<0.01). A second model with natural pace on short distance and movement smoothness was almost equally strong (R-adjusted(2) 0.71, p<0.01). Patients improved their walking speed (p<0.01), but not smoothness (p=0.08-0.12), over the course of rehabilitation. Conclusions. Since we were not able to observe improvements in smoothness of gait, we conclude that rehabilitation programs should be adapted to the patient's physiological capacities in order to allow for such improvements in smoothness of gait. Externally valid gait capacity (6MWT) could be predicted by a single walk for 10 s at natural pace.","[Gulde, Philipp; Rieckmann, Peter] Ctr Clin Neuroplast Med Pk Loipl, Bischofswiesen, Germany; [Hermsdoerfer, Joachim] Tech Univ Munich, Munich, Germany",Technical University of Munich,"Gulde, P (corresponding author), Ctr Clin Neuroplast Med Pk Loipl, Bischofswiesen, Germany.",p.gulde@medicalpark.de; joachim.hermsdoerfer@tum.de; p.rieckmann@medicalpark.de,,"Gulde, Philipp/0000-0001-5436-3462",,,,,38,0,0,1,1,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",2090-2654,2090-2662,,MULT SCLER INT,Mult.

Recently, the need for person-centered approach utilizing personalization, prediction, prevention, and participation, known as the P4 model, in fall prevention has been highlighted. Features of mobile technology make it a suitable technological infrastructure to employ such an approach. This narrative review aims to review the evidence for using mobile technology for personalized fall risk assessment and prevention since 2017 in older adults. We aim to identify lessons learned and future directions for using mobile technology as a fall risk assessment and prevention tool. Articles were searched in PubMed and Web of Science with search terms related to older adults, mobile technology, and falls prevention. A total of 23 articles were included. Articles were identified as those examining aspects of the P4 model including prediction (measurement of fall risk), personalization (usability), prevention, and participation. Mobile technology appears to be comparable to gold-standard technology in measuring well-known fall risk factors including static and dynamic balance. Seven applications were developed to measure different fall risk factors and tested for personalization, and/or participation aspects, and 4 were integrated into a falls prevention program. Mobile health technology offers an innovative solution to provide tailored fall risk screening, prediction, and participation. Future studies should incorporate multiple, objective fall risk measures and implement them in community settings to determine if mobile technology can offer tailored and scalable interventions.","[Hsieh, Katherine L.] Wake Forest Sch Med, Sect Gerontol & Geriatr Med, Dept Internal Med, Winston Salem, NC 27101 USA; [Chen, Lingjun; Sosnoff, Jacob J.] Univ Kansas, Med Ctr, Dept Phys Therapy Rehabil Sci & Athlet Training, Kansas City, KS 66103 USA",Wake Forest University; University of Kansas; University of Kansas Medical Center,"Sosnoff, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Kansas, Med Ctr, Dept Phys Therapy Rehabil Sci & Athlet Training, Sch Hlth Profess, 3599 Rainbow Blvd, Kansas City, KS 66103 USA.",jsosnoff@kumc.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health [R21AG073892, R21AG064308-01]; National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research [90DPHF0010, 90REGE0006-01-00]; National Multiple Sclerosis Society [MB-1807-31633, RG-1701-26862]; National Institute of Health [T32 AG033534]","National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research(United States Department of Health & Human Services); National Multiple Sclerosis Society(National Multiple Sclerosis Society); National Institute of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA)","J.J.S. is funded by National Institutes of Health (R21AG073892); (R21AG064308-01); National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research (90DPHF0010; 90REGE0006-01-00); National Multiple Sclerosis Society (MB-1807-31633; RG-1701-26862).

Brain-inHand is a smartphone app designed to support psychological problems and encourage behaviour change, comprised of a structured diary, reminders, agreed solutions, and traffic light monitoring system. Aim: To evaluate the potential use and effectiveness of Brain-in-Hand for self-management in adults with acquired brain injury. Methods: A-B mixed-methods case-study design. Individuals with acquired brain injury (n = 10) received Brain-in-Hand for up to 12 months. Measures of mood, independence, quality of life, cognition, fatigue, goal attainment, participation administered at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Semi-structured interviews conducted with acquired brain injury participants (n = 9) and healthcare workers (n = 3) at 6 months. Results: Significant increase in goal attainment after 6 months use (t(7) = 4.20, p = .004). No significant improvement in other outcomes. Qualitative data suggested improvement in anxiety management. Contextual (personal/environmental) factors were key in influencing the use and effectiveness of Brain-in-Hand. Having sufficient insight, appropriate support and motivation facilitated use. Conclusions: Brain-in-Hand shows potential to support acquired brain injury, but further work is required to determine its effectiveness. Context played a pivotal role in the effectiveness and sustained use of Brain-in-Hand, and needs to be explored to support implementation.","[Kettlewell, Jade] Univ Nottingham, Ctr Acad Primary Care, Sch Med, Appl Hlth Res Bldg, Nottingham, England; [Ward, Asha; Radford, Kate] Univ Nottingham, Ctr Rehabil & Ageing Res Injury Inflammat & Recov, Sch Med, Nottingham, England; [das Nair, Roshan] Univ Nottingham, Div Psychiat & Appl Psychol, Nottingham, England; [das Nair, Roshan] Nottinghamshire Univ Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, Inst Mental Hlth, Nottingham, England",University of Nottingham; University of Nottingham; University of Nottingham,"Kettlewell, J (corresponding author), Ctr Acad Primary Care, Allied Hlth Res Bldg,Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",jade.kettlewell2@nottingham.ac.uk,,"Kettlewell, Jade/0000-0002-6713-4551","Hermes Fellowship, the University of Nottingham; Brain in Hand Ltd.","Hermes Fellowship, the University of Nottingham; Brain in Hand Ltd.","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: JK was a PhD student at the time of conducting this research, funded by a Hermes Fellowship, the University of Nottingham and Brain in Hand Ltd.",,40,0,0,1,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",2055-6683,,,J REHABIL ASSIST TER,J.

Methods The electronic databases MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched (June 2021). Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on patients of any age with neurological diseases were considered. Two reviewers screened and abstracted data in duplicate and independently and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (RoB 2). When possible, pooled effect estimates were calculated. Results Of a total of 3018 records initially retrieved, 25 RCTs (n = 2335) were included: 11 (n = 804) on stroke, four (n = 520) on Parkinson's disease, three (n = 110) on multiple sclerosis, two (n = 320) on epilepsy, one (n = 63) on dementia, one (n = 23) on spina bifida, one (n = 40) on migraine, one (n = 22) on cerebral palsy and one (n = 433) on brain damage. Types of telemedicine assessed were online visits (11 studies), tele-rehabilitation (seven studies), telephone calls (three), smartphone apps (two) and online computer software (two). The evidence was quite limited except for stroke. Compared to usual care alone, telemedicine plus usual care was found to improve depressive symptoms, functional status, motor function, executive function, generic quality of life, healthcare utilization and healthy lifestyle in patients in post-stroke follow-up. Conclusions Well-designed and executed RCTs are needed to confirm our findings on stroke and to have more scientific evidence available for the other neurological diseases.","[Leon-Salas, Beatriz; Gonzalez-Hernandez, Yadira; Infante-Ventura, Diego; de Armas-Castellano, Aythami; Rodriguez-Rodriguez, Leticia; Trujillo-Martin, Maria M.] Canary Islands Hlth Res Inst Fdn FIISC, Tenerife, Spain; [Leon-Salas, Beatriz; Gonzalez-Hernandez, Yadira; Infante-Ventura, Diego; de Armas-Castellano, Aythami; Rodriguez-Rodriguez, Leticia; Trujillo-Martin, Maria M.] Canary Islands Hlth Serv SCS, Evaluat Unit SESCS, Tenerife, Spain; [Leon-Salas, Beatriz; Gonzalez-Hernandez, Yadira; Infante-Ventura, Diego; de Armas-Castellano, Aythami; Rodriguez-Rodriguez, Leticia; Trujillo-Martin, Maria M.] Spanish Network Agencies Hlth Technol Assessment, Madrid, Spain; [Leon-Salas, Beatriz; Carmona-Rodriguez, Montserrat; Trujillo-Martin, Maria M.] Res Network Hlth Serv Chron Dis REDISSEC, Madrid, Spain; [Leon-Salas, Beatriz; Carmona-Rodriguez, Montserrat; Trujillo-Martin, Maria M.] Network Res Chron Primary Care & Hlth Promot RICA, Madrid, Spain; [Garcia-Garcia, Javier] Nuestra Senora Candelaria Univ Hosp, Qual & Patient Safety Unit, Tenerife, Spain; [Garcia-Hernandez, Miguel] Canary Islands Hlth Serv SCS, Teaching Unit Family & Community Med La Laguna Te, Primary Care Management Tenerife, Tenerife, Spain; [Carmona-Rodriguez, Montserrat] Inst Salud Carlos III, Hlth Technol Assessment Agcy, Madrid, Spain; [Olazaran, Javier] Gregorio Maranon Univ Hosp, Neurol Serv, Madrid, Spain; [Dobato, Jose Luis] Alcorcon Fdn Univ Hosp, Neurol Serv, Madrid, Spain",Instituto de Salud Carlos III; Agencia de Evaluacion de Tecnologias Sanitarias (AETS); General University Gregorio Maranon Hospital; Alcorcon Foundation University Hospital,"Leon-Salas, B (corresponding author), Serv Evaluac Serv Canario Salud, 44 CS San Isidro El Chorrillo, Tenerife 38109, Spain.",beatriz.leonsalas@sescs.es,"Carmona, Montserrat/F-7593-2010","Carmona, Montserrat/0000-0002-4680-7745; InfanteVentura, Diego/0000-0003-4197-7849; de Armas-Castellano, Aythami/0000-0002-5054-7296; Garcia Hernandez, Miguel/0000-0002-7352-4273",Spanish Ministry of Health,Spanish Ministry of Health(Instituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government),The Spanish Ministry of Health,,51,0,0,6,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1351-5101,1468-1331,,EUR J NEUROL,Eur.

A diagnosis in the first weeks of child's life is crucial to plan timely and appropriate rehabilitative interventions. An accurate visual assessment of infants' spontaneous movements requires highly specialized personnel, not always available, and it is operator dependent. Motion capture systems, markers and wearable sensors are commonly used for human motion analysis, but they can be cumbersome, limiting their use in the study of infants' movements. Methods: In this paper we propose a computer-aided pipeline to characterize and classify infants' motion from 2D video recordings. The final goal is detecting anomalous motion patterns. The implemented pipeline is based on computer vision and machine learning algorithms and includes a specific step to increase the interpretability of the results. Specifically, it can be summarized by the following steps: (i) body keypoints detection: we rely on a deep learning-based semantic features detector to localize the positions of meaningful landmark points on infants' bodies; (ii) parameters extraction: starting from the trajectories of the detected landmark points, we extract quantitative parameters describing infants motion patterns; (iii) classification: we implement different classifiers (Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, fully connected Neural Network, Long Short Term Memory) that, starting from the motion parameters, classify between normal or abnormal motion patterns. Results: We tested the proposed pipeline on a dataset, recorded at the 40th gestational week, of 142 infants, 59 with evidence of neuromotor disorders according to a medical assessment carried out a posteriori.

Remotely acquired digital endpoints have been recognized for their potential in providing frequent, real-time monitoring of cognition, but their ultimate value will be determined by the reliability and sensitivity of measurement in the populations of interest. To this end, we describe initial validation of remote self-administration of cognitive tests within a regulatorily compliant tablet-based platform. Participants were 61 older adults (age 55+), including 20 individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD). To allow comparison between remote (in-home) and site-based testing, participants completed 2 testing sessions 1 week apart. Results for three of four cognitive domains assessed demonstrated equivalence between remote and site-based tests, with high cross-modality ICCs (absolute agreement) for Symbol Coding (ICC = 0.75), Visuospatial Working Memory (ICC = 0.70) and Verbal Fluency (ICC > 0.73). Group differences in these domains were significant and reflected sensitivity to objective cognitive impairment in the SCD group for both remote and site-based testing (p < 0.05). In contrast, performance on tests of verbal episodic memory suggested inflated performance during unmonitored testing and indicate reliable use of remote cognitive assessments may depend on the construct, as well as the population being tested.","[Atkins, Alexandra S.; Kraus, Michael S.; Welch, Matthew; Yuan, Zhenhua; Stevens, Heather; Welsh-Bohmer, Kathleen A.; Keefe, Richard S.

The primary aim of this study is to propose and validate a protocol for simulating real-world gait accounting for all these factors within a single set of observations, while ensuring minimisation of participant burden and safety. Methods: The protocol included eight motor tasks at varying speed, incline/steps, surface, path shape, cognitive demand, and included postures that may abruptly alter the participants' strategy of walking. It was deployed in a convenience sample of 108 participants recruited from six cohorts that included older healthy adults (HA) and participants with potentially altered mobility due to Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), proximal femoral fracture (PFF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or congestive heart failure (CHF). A novelty introduced in the protocol was the tiered approach to increase difficulty both within the same task (e.g., by allowing use of aids or armrests) and across tasks. Results: The protocol proved to be safe and feasible (all participants could complete it and no adverse events were recorded) and the addition of the more complex tasks allowed a much greater spread in walking speeds to be achieved compared to standard straight walking trials. Furthermore, it allowed a representation of a variety of daily life relevant mobility aspects and can therefore be used for the validation of monitoring devices used in real life. Conclusions: The protocol allowed for measuring gait in a variety of pathological conditions suggests that it can also be used to detect changes in gait due to, for example, the onset or progression of a disease, or due to therapy.","[Scott, Kirsty;

The use of mobile and inexpensive technologies such as some markerless motion capture technologies is especially promising for large-scale application but has not transitioned into clinical routine to date. A crucial step on this path is to implement standardized, clinically applicable tools that identify and control for quality concerns. Objective: The main goal of this study comprises the development of a systematic quality control (QC) procedure for data collected with markerless motion capture technology and its experimental implementation to identify specific quality concerns and thereby rate the usability of recordings. Methods: We developed a post hoc QC pipeline that was evaluated using a large set of short motor task recordings of healthy controls (2010 recordings from 162 subjects) and people with multiple sclerosis (2682 recordings from 187 subjects). For each of these recordings, 2 raters independently applied the pipeline. They provided overall usability decisions and identified technical and performance-related quality concerns, which yielded respective proportions of their occurrence as a main result. Results: The approach developed here has proven user-friendly and applicable on a large scale. Raters' decisions on recording usability were concordant in 71.5%-92.3% of cases, depending on the motor task. Furthermore, 39.6%-85.1% of recordings were concordantly rated as being of satisfactory quality whereas in 5.0%-26.3%, both raters agreed to discard the recording. Conclusions: We present a QC pipeline that seems feasible and useful for instant quality screening in the clinical setting. Results confirm the need of QC despite using standard test setups, testing protocols, and operator training for the employed system and by extension, for other task-based motor assessment technologies. Results of the QC process can be used to clean existing data sets, optimize quality assurance measures, as well as foster the development of automated QC approaches and therefore improve the overall reliability of kinematic data sets.","[Roehling, Hanna Marie; Althoff, Patrik; Arsenova, Radina; Drebinger, Daniel; Gigengack, Norman; Chorschew, Anna; Ellermeyer, Tobias; Paul, Friedemann; Schmitz-Huebsch, Tanja] Expt & Clin Res Ctr, Lindenberger Weg 80, D-13125 Berlin, Germany; [Roehling, Hanna Marie; Althoff, Patrik; Arsenova, Radina; Drebinger, Daniel; Gigengack, Norman; Chorschew, Anna; Ellermeyer, Tobias; Paul, Friedemann; Schmitz-Huebsch, Tanja] Charite Univ Med Berlin, Expt & Clin Res Ctr, Berlin, Germany; [Roehling, Hanna Marie; Althoff, Patrik; Arsenova, Radina; Drebinger, Daniel; Gigengack, Norman; Chorschew, Anna; Kroneberg, Daniel; Roennefarth, Maria; Ellermeyer, Tobias; Behnia, Behnoush; Paul, Friedemann; Brandt, Alexander Ulrich; Schmitz-Huebsch, Tanja] Free Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Roehling, Hanna Marie; Althoff, Patrik; Arsenova, Radina; Drebinger, Daniel; Gigengack, Norman; Chorschew, Anna; Kroneberg, Daniel; Roennefarth, Maria; Ellermeyer, Tobias; Behnia, Behnoush; Paul, Friedemann; Brandt, Alexander Ulrich; Schmitz-Huebsch, Tanja] Humboldt Univ, Berlin, Germany; [Roehling, Hanna Marie; Althoff, Patrik; Arsenova, Radina; Drebinger, Daniel; Gigengack, Norman; Chorschew, Anna; Ellermeyer, Tobias; Paul, Friedemann; Schmitz-Huebsch, Tanja] Helmholtz Assoc MDC, Max Delbruck Ctr Mol Med, Berlin, Germany; [Roehling, Hanna Marie] Motognosis GmbH, Berlin, Germany; [Arsenova, Radina] St Joseph Krankenhaus Berlin Tempelhof, Dept Pediat, Berlin, Germany; [Kroneberg, Daniel; Roennefarth, Maria; Paul, Friedemann] Charite Univ Med Berlin, Dept Neurol, Berlin, Germany; [Roennefarth, Maria] Charite Univ Med Berlin, Berlin Inst Hlth, Clin Study Ctr, Berlin, Germany; [Ellermeyer, Tobias] Vivantes Auguste Viktoria Klinikum, Dept Neurol, Berlin, Germany; [Rosenkranz, Sina Catherine; Heesen, Christoph] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Ctr Mol Neurobiol Hamburg ZMNH, Inst Neuroimmunol & Multiple Sclerosis, Hamburg, Germany; [Rosenkranz, Sina Catherine; Heesen, Christoph] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Dept Neurol, Hamburg, Germany; [Behnia, Behnoush] Charite Univ Med Berlin, Dept Psychiat, Berlin, Germany; [Hirano, Shigeki; Kuwabara, Satoshi] Chiba Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Chiba, Japan; [Paul, Friedemann; Brandt, Alexander Ulrich; Schmitz-Huebsch, Tanja] Charite Univ Med Berlin, NeuroCure Clin Res Ctr, Berlin, Germany; [Brandt, Alexander Ulrich] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Neurol, Irvine, CA 92717 USA",Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin; Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Helmholtz Association; Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine; Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin; Berlin Institute of Health; Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin; University of Hamburg; University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf; University of Hamburg; University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf; Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin; Chiba University; Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin; University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Rohling, HM (corresponding author), Expt & Clin Res Ctr, Lindenberger Weg 80, D-13125 Berlin, Germany.",hanna-marie.roehling@charite.de,,"Althoff, Patrik/0000-0002-8044-4538; Ellermeyer, Tobias/0000-0002-5217-9896; Gigengack, Norman/0000-0003-4852-9547; Arsenova, Radina/0000-0003-3116-0464","NeuroCure Clinical Research Center (NCRC) - Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under Germany`s Excellence Strategy [EXC-2049 -390688087]; Charite-BIH Clinical Study Center - Roche; Charite -Universitatsmedizin Berlin; Berlin Institute of Health; Clinician-Scientist Fellowship from the Stifterverband fur die Deutsche Wissenschaft; Hertie Network of Excellence in Clinical Neuroscience of the Gemeinnutzige Hertie-Stiftung","NeuroCure Clinical Research Center (NCRC) - Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under Germany`s Excellence Strategy; Charite-BIH Clinical Study Center - Roche; Charite -Universitatsmedizin Berlin; Berlin Institute of Health; Clinician-Scientist Fellowship from the Stifterverband fur die Deutsche Wissenschaft; Hertie Network of Excellence in Clinical Neuroscience of the Gemeinnutzige Hertie-Stiftung","We thank NeuroCure Clinical Research Center (NCRC), funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under Germany`s Excellence Strategy -EXC-2049 -390688087 and Charite-BIH Clinical Study Center.

They hold potential for understanding current depression status and predicting future depression status. However, the promise of using RMTs for relapse prediction is heavily dependent on user engagement, which is defined as both a behavioral and experiential construct. A better understanding of how to promote engagement in RMT research through various in-app components will aid in providing scalable solutions for future remote research, higher quality results, and applications for implementation in clinical practice. Objective: The aim of this study is to provide the rationale and protocol for a 2-armed randomized controlled trial to investigate the effect of insightful notifications, progress visualization, and researcher contact details on behavioral and experiential engagement with a multi-parametric mobile health data collection platform, Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse (RADAR)-base. Methods: We aim to recruit 140 participants upon completion of their participation in the RADAR Major Depressive Disorder study in the London site. Data will be collected using 3 weekly tasks through an active smartphone app, a passive (background) data collection app, and a Fitbit device. Participants will be randomly allocated at a 1:1 ratio to receive either an adapted version of the active app that incorporates insightful notifications, progress visualization, and access to researcher contact details or the active app as usual. Statistical tests will be used to assess the hypotheses that participants using the adapted app will complete a higher percentage of weekly tasks (behavioral engagement: primary outcome) and score higher on self-awareness measures (experiential engagement). Results: Recruitment commenced in April 2021. Data collection was completed in September 2021. The results of this study will be communicated via publication in 2022. Conclusions: This study aims to understand how best to promote engagement with RMTs in depression research.

Assistive technologies include 'low-tech' items, such as memory aids and digital calendars or 'high-tech' items, like health tracking devices and wearables. Depending on the type of assistive devices, they can be used to improve quality of life, effect lifestyle improvements and increase levels of independence. Acceptance of technology among patients and carers depends on various factors such as perceived skills and competencies in using the device, expectations, trust and reliability. This service evaluation explored the impact of a pilot service redesign focused on improving health and wellbeing by the use of a voice-activated device 'smart speaker', Alexa Echo Show 8. Methods A service evaluation/market research was conducted for a pilot service redesign programme. Data were collected via a survey in person or telephone and from two focus groups of patients (n = 44) and informal carers (n = 7). The age of the study participants ranged from 50 to 90 years. Also, the participants belonged to two types of cohort: one specifically focused on diabetes and the other on a range of long-term health conditions such as multiple sclerosis, dementia, depression and others. Results The device had a positive impact on the health and social well-being of the users; many direct and indirect benefits were identified. Both patients and carers had positive attitudes towards using the device. Self-reported benefits included: reminders for medications and appointments improved adherence and disease control; increased independence and productivity; and for those living alone, the device helped combat their loneliness and low mood. Conclusion The findings from the study help to realise the potential of assistive technology for empowering supporting health/social care. Especially, the season of COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for remote management of health, the use of assistive technology could have a pivotal role to play with the sustainability of health/social care provision by promoting shared care between the care provider and service user. Further evaluation can explore the key drivers and barriers for implementing assistive technologies, especially in people who are ageing and with long-term health conditions.","[Balasubramanian, Gayathri Victoria] Staffordshire Univ, Fac Hlth, Ctr Biomech & Rehabil Technol, Stoke On Trent, Staffs, England; [Beaney, Paul] Keele Univ, Med Sch, Newcastle Under Lyme, England; [Chambers, Ruth] Staffordshire & Stoke Trent Sustainabil & Transfo, Digital Workstream, Stoke On Trent, Staffs, England",Staffordshire University; Keele University,"Balasubramanian, GV (corresponding author), Staffordshire Univ, Fac Hlth, Ctr Biomech & Rehabil Technol, Stoke On Trent, Staffs, England.",Gayathri.balasubramanian@research.staffs.ac.uk,,,NHSE's Estates & Technology Transformation funds,NHSE's Estates & Technology Transformation funds,"The personal digital assistant equipment and individualised support from the local Home Instead and Wavemaker organisations were funded from NHSE's Estates & Technology Transformation funds allocated to Staffordshire's Sustainability & Transformation Partnership (STP) digital workstream board's technology-enabled care services programme.

However, those who suffer from multiple sclerosis or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis may require other methods to control an electric wheelchair. This study implements an electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) system and a steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) to manipulate an electric wheelchair. While operating the human-machine interface, three types of SSVEP scenarios involving a real-time virtual stimulus are displayed on a monitor or mixed reality (MR) goggles to produce the EEG signals. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is used to classify the EEG signals into the corresponding class of command and the information transfer rate (ITR) is used to determine the effect. The experimental results show that the proposed SSVEP stimulus generates the EEG signals because of the high classification accuracy of CCA. This is used to control an electric wheelchair along a specific path. Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is the mapping method that is available in the robotic operating software (ROS) platform that is used for the wheelchair system for this study.","[Chen, Wen; Chen, Chin-Sheng] Natl Taipei Univ Technol, Grad Inst Automat Technol, Taipei 10608, Taiwan; [Chen, Shih-Kang] Ind Technol Res Inst, Dept Mechatron Control, Hsinchu 310401, Taiwan; [Liu, Yi-Hung] Natl Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mech Engn, Taipei 106335, Taiwan; [Chen, Yu-Jen] MacKay Mem Hosp, Dept Radiat Oncol, Taipei 10449, Taiwan",National Taipei University of Technology; Industrial Technology Research Institute - Taiwan; National Taiwan University of Science & Technology; Mackay Memorial Hospital,"Chen, CS (corresponding author), Natl Taipei Univ Technol, Grad Inst Automat Technol, Taipei 10608, Taiwan.",saint@ntut.edu.tw,,"Chen, Shih-Kang/0000-0002-1895-2144; Liu, Yi-Hung/0000-0003-2536-1606",National Taipei University of Technology [NTUT-MMH-101-09]; Mackay Memorial Hospital [NTUT-MMH-101-09]; Ministry of Science and Technology [MOST 109-2221-E-027-044-MY3],"National Taipei University of Technology; Mackay Memorial Hospital; Ministry of Science and Technology(Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Republic of Korea)",This research was supported in part by National Taipei University of Technology and Mackay Memorial Hospital Joint Research Program (NTUT-MMH-101-09); and in part by the Ministry of Science and Technology under project No. MOST 109-2221-E-027-044-MY3.,,29,2,2,8,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2079-6374,,BIOSENSORS-BASEL,Biosensors-Basel,OCT,2022,12,10,,,,,,,772,10.3390/bios12100772,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/bios12100772,,,20,"Chemistry, Analytical; Nanoscience & Nanotechnology; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Instruments & Instrumentation,5O1BY,36290910,gold,,,2023-02-20,WOS:000872218400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

IMU provide a versatile solution for recording inertial data including linear acceleration and angular velocity, but reconstructing head position is difficult or impossible. This problem can be solved by incorporating visual data using a technique known as visual-inertial simultaneous localization and mapping (VI-SLAM). A recently released commercial solution, the Intel RealSense T265, uses a proprietary VI-SLAM algorithm to estimate linear and angular position and velocity, but the performance of this device for tracking of natural human head motion in natural environments has not yet been comprehensively evaluated against gold-standard methods. In this study, we used a wide range of metrics to evaluate the performance of the T265 with different walking speeds in different environments, both indoor and outdoor, against two gold-standard methods, an optical tracking system and a so-called perambulator. Overall, we find that performance of the T265 relative to these gold-standard methods is most accurate for slow to normal walking speeds in small- to medium-sized environments. The suitability of this device for future scientific studies depends on the application; data presented here can be useful in making that determination.","[Hausamann, Peter; Daumer, Martin] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Sinnott, Christian B.; MacNeilage, Paul R.] Univ Nevada, Dept Psychol, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Daumer, Martin] Sylvia Lawry Ctr Multiple Sclerosis Res eV, D-81677 Munich, Germany",Technical University of Munich; Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Reno,"Hausamann, P (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, D-80333 Munich, Germany.",peter.hausamann@tum.de,"cao, xiaoxiang/AAR-9291-2021; Sinnott, Christian Bernard/GLT-3417-2022",,NSF [OIA-1920896]; NIH [P20 GM103650],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA),"This research was supported by NSF under Grant Number OIA-1920896 and NIH under Grant Number P20 GM103650.

A second difficulty is under-estimation of turn angle due to short-duration hesitations by people with neurological disorders. We aimed to validate and determine the generalizability of a: I. Discrete Turn Algorithm for variable and sequential turns close in time and II: Merged Turn Algorithm for a single turn angle in the presence of hesitations. Methods: We validated the Discrete Turn Algorithm with motion capture in healthy controls (HC, n = 10) performing a spectrum of turn angles. Subsequently, the generalizability of the Discrete Turn Algorithm and associated, Merged Turn Algorithm were tested in people with Parkinson's disease (PD, n = 124), spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA, n = 51), and HC (n = 125). Results: The Discrete Turn Algorithm shows improved agreement with optical motion capture and with known turn angles, compared to our previous algorithm by El-Gohary et al. The Merged Turn algorithm that merges consecutive turns in the same direction with short hesitations resulted in turn angle estimates closer to a fixed 180-degree turn angle in the PD, SCA, and HC subjects compared to our previous turn algorithm. Additional metrics were proposed to capture turn hesitations in PD and SCA. Conclusion: The Discrete Turn Algorithm may be particularly useful to characterize turns when the turn angle is unknown, i.e., during free-living conditions. The Merged Turn algorithm is recommended for clinical tasks in which the single-turn angle is known, especially for patients who hesitate while turning.","[Shah, Vrutangkumar V.; Mancini, Martina; Carlson-Kuhta, Patricia; Nutt, John G.; Horak, Fay B.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Portland, OR 97239 USA; [Curtze, Carolin] Univ Nebraska, Omaha, NE 68182 USA; [Gomez, Christopher M.] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [El-Gohary, Mahmoud; Horak, Fay B.; McNames, James] APDM Wearable Technol, Portland, OR USA; [McNames, James] Portland State Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Portland, OR USA",Oregon Health & Science University; University of Nebraska System; University of Chicago; Portland State University,"Shah, VV (corresponding author), Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Portland, OR 97239 USA.",shahvr@ohsu.edu,"Shah, Vrutang/AAW-3466-2020","Shah, Vrutang/0000-0002-8626-1089; Curtze, Carolin/0000-0001-5394-4628",APDM Wearable Technologies; National Institutes of Health [R01AG006457]; Department of Veterans Affairs Merit Award [5I01RX001075]; Medical Research Foundation of Oregon,APDM Wearable Technologies; National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Department of Veterans Affairs Merit Award(US Department of Veterans Affairs); Medical Research Foundation of Oregon,"The work of Mahmoud ElGohary, Fay B.

To foster implementation and facilitate interpretation of respective outcomes, we aimed to establish normative data of healthy subjects for a markerless RGB-Depth camera-based motion analysis system and to illustrate their use. Methods: We recorded 133 healthy adults (56% female) aged 20 to 60 years with an RGB-Depth camera-based motion analysis system. Forty-three spatiotemporal parameters were extracted from six short, standardized motor tasks-including three gait tasks, stepping in place, standing-up and sitting down, and a postural control task. Associations with confounding factors, height, weight, age, and sex were modelled using a predictive linear regression approach. A z-score normalization approach was provided to improve usability of the data. Results: We reported descriptive statistics for each spatiotemporal parameter (mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, quartiles). Robust confounding associations emerged for step length and step width in comfortable speed gait only. Accessible normative data usage was lastly exemplified with recordings from one randomly selected individual with multiple sclerosis. Conclusion: We provided normative data for an RGB depth camera-based motion analysis system covering broad aspects of motor capacity.","[Roehling, Hanna Marie; Otte, Karen; Rust, Rebekka; Dorsch, Eva-Maria; Paul, Friedemann; Schmitz-Huebsch, Tanja] Expt & Clin Res Ctr, D-13125 Berlin, Germany; [Roehling, Hanna Marie; Otte, Karen; Rust, Rebekka; Dorsch, Eva-Maria; Paul, Friedemann; Schmitz-Huebsch, Tanja] Charite Univ Med Berlin, Expt & Clin Res Ctr, D-13125 Berlin, Germany; [Roehling, Hanna Marie; Otte, Karen; Rekers, Sophia; Finke, Carsten; Rust, Rebekka; Dorsch, Eva-Maria; Behnia, Behnoush; Paul, Friedemann; Schmitz-Huebsch, Tanja] Free Univ Berlin, D-13125 Berlin, Germany; [Roehling, Hanna Marie; Otte, Karen; Rekers, Sophia; Finke, Carsten; Rust, Rebekka; Dorsch, Eva-Maria; Behnia, Behnoush; Paul, Friedemann; Schmitz-Huebsch, Tanja] Humboldt Univ, D-13125 Berlin, Germany; [Roehling, Hanna Marie; Otte, Karen; Rust, Rebekka; Dorsch, Eva-Maria; Paul, Friedemann; Schmitz-Huebsch, Tanja] Max Delbruck Ctr Mol Med Helmholtz Assoc MDC, D-13125 Berlin, Germany; [Roehling, Hanna Marie; Otte, Karen] Motognosis GmbH, D-10119 Berlin, Germany; [Rekers, Sophia; Finke, Carsten; Dorsch, Eva-Maria; Paul, Friedemann] Charite Univ Med Berlin, Dept Neurol, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Rekers, Sophia; Finke, Carsten] Humboldt Univ, Berlin Sch Mind & Brain, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Rust, Rebekka; Paul, Friedemann; Schmitz-Huebsch, Tanja] Charite Univ Med Berlin, NeuroCure Clin Res Ctr, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Behnia, Behnoush] Charite Univ Med Berlin, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapy, D-10117 Berlin, Germany",Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin; Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Helmholtz Association; Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine; Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin; Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin,"Rohling, HM; Schmitz-Hubsch, T (corresponding author), Expt & Clin Res Ctr, D-13125 Berlin, Germany.;Rohling, HM; Schmitz-Hubsch, T (corresponding author), Charite Univ Med Berlin, Expt & Clin Res Ctr, D-13125 Berlin, Germany.;Rohling, HM; Schmitz-Hubsch, T (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, D-13125 Berlin, Germany.;Rohling, HM; Schmitz-Hubsch, T (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, D-13125 Berlin, Germany.;Rohling, HM; Schmitz-Hubsch, T (corresponding author), Max Delbruck Ctr Mol Med Helmholtz Assoc MDC, D-13125 Berlin, Germany.;Rohling, HM (corresponding author), Motognosis GmbH, D-10119 Berlin, Germany.;Schmitz-Hubsch, T (corresponding author), Charite Univ Med Berlin, NeuroCure Clin Res Ctr, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",hanna-marie.roehling@charite.de; tanja.schmitz-huebsch@charite.de,,"Rekers, Sophia/0000-0002-6161-6621","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) [EXC-2049-390688087]; Charite-BIH Clinical Study Center","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Charite-BIH Clinical Study Center","We thank NeuroCure Clinical Research Center (NCRC) for administrative support.

Games for adults that require physical activity, known as exergames, offer opportunities here. In particular, the output of the gaming industry nowadays offers computer games with extended reality (XR) which combines real and virtual environments and refers to human-machine interactions generated by computers and wearable technologies. For example, playing the game in front of a computer screen while standing or walking on a force plate or treadmill allows the user to react to certain infrastructural changes and obstacles within the virtual environment. Recent developments, optimization, and minimizations in wearable technology have produced wireless headsets and sensors that allow for unrestricted whole-body movement. This makes the virtual experience more immersive and provides the opportunity for greater engagement than traditional exercise. Currently, XR serves as an umbrella term for current immersive technologies as well as future realities that enhance the experience with features that produce new controllable environments. Overall, these technology-enhanced exergames challenge the adult user and modify the experience by increasing sensory stimulation and creating an environment where virtual and real elements interact. As a therapy, exergames can potentially create new environments and visualizations that may be more ecologically valid and thus simulate real activities of daily living that can be trained. Furthermore, by adding telemedicine features to the exergame, progress over time can be closely monitored and feedback provided, offering future opportunities for cognitive-motor assessment. To more optimally serve and challenge adults both physically and cognitively over time in future lockdowns, there is a need to provide long-term remote training and feedback. Particularly related to activities of daily living that create opportunities for effective and lasting rehabilitation for elderly and sufferers from chronic non-communicable diseases (CNDs).

This fatigue affects the performance of workers in jobs that involve some continuous physical activity, and is the cause of a large proportion of accidents at work. The physical fatigue is commonly measured by the perceived exertion (RPE). Many previous studies have attempted to continuously monitor workers in order to detect the level of fatigue and prevent these accidents, but most have used invasive sensors that are difficult to place and prevent the worker from performing their tasks correctly. Other works use activity measurement sensors such as accelerometers, but the large amount of information obtained is difficult to analyse in order to extract the characteristics of each fatigue state. In this work, we use a dataset that contains data from inertial sensors of several workers performing various activities during their working day, labelled every 10 min based on their level of fatigue using questionnaires and the Borg fatigue scale. Applying Machine Learning techniques, we design, develop and test a system based on a neural network capable of classifying the variation of fatigue caused by the physical activity collected every 10 min; for this purpose, a feature extraction is performed after the time decomposition done with the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). The results show that the proposed system has an accuracy higher than 92% for all the cases, being viable for its application in the proposed scenario.","[Escobar-Linero, Elena] Univ Seville, Biomed Engn Architecture & Comp Technol Dept ATC, Robot & Technol Comp Lab RTC, Avda Reina Mercedes s-n, Seville 41012, Spain; [Dominguez-Morales, Manuel] Univ Seville, Comp Engn Inst I3US, Architecture & Comp Technol Dept ATC, Robot & Technol Comp Lab RTC, Avda Reina Mercedes s-n, 41012 Seville, Spain; [Sevillano, Jose Luis] Univ Seville, Comp Engn Res Inst I3US, Architecture & Comp Technol Dept ATC, Robot & Technol Comp Lab RTC, Avda Reina Mercedes s-n, 41012 Seville, Spain; [Dominguez-Morales, Manuel] ETS Ingn Informat, Architecture & Comp Technol Dept ATC, Avda Reina Mercedes s-n,Of F0 71, Seville 41012, Spain",University of Sevilla; University of Sevilla; University of Sevilla; University of Sevilla,"Dominguez-Morales, M (corresponding author), ETS Ingn Informat, Architecture & Comp Technol Dept ATC, Avda Reina Mercedes s-n,Of F0 71, Seville 41012, Spain.",eescobar@us.es; mjdominguez@us.es; jlsevillano@us.es,"Sevillano, Jose Luis/K-2484-2013; Dominguez Morales, Manuel Jesus/I-3786-2015","Sevillano, Jose Luis/0000-0002-1392-1832; Dominguez Morales, Manuel Jesus/0000-0001-5669-9111; Escobar, Elena/0000-0001-8789-6476","Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional'' (FEDER); Consejeria de Economia, Conocimiento, Empresas y Universidad'' of the Junta de Andalucia, under Programa Operativo FEDER 2014-2020 [US-1263715]","Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional'' (FEDER)(European CommissionSpanish Government); Consejeria de Economia, Conocimiento, Empresas y Universidad'' of the Junta de Andalucia, under Programa Operativo FEDER 2014-2020","This work has been supported by Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional'' (FEDER) and Consejeria de Economia, Conocimiento, Empresas y Universidad'' of the Junta de Andalucia, under Programa Operativo FEDER 2014-2020 (Project US-1263715).",,67,0,0,3,7,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0957-4174,1873-6793,,EXPERT SYST APPL,Expert Syst.

Materials and Methods Guided by relevant sections of the COBIT framework and ISO 27001 standard, we created a data control framework supporting high-quality real-world data (RWD) studies in multiple disease areas. We first mapped and described the entire data journey and identified potential risks for data loss or inconsistencies. Based on this map, we implemented a control framework adhering to best practices and tested its effectiveness through an analysis of random data samples. An internal strategy board was set up to regularly identify and implement potential improvements. Results We herein describe the implementation of a data management and control framework for multiple sclerosis, one disease area in the NeuroTransData (NTD) registry that exemplifies the dynamic needs for high-quality RWD analysis. Regular manual and automated analysis of random data samples at multiple checkpoints guided the development and implementation of the framework and continue to ensure timely identification of potential threats to data accuracy. Discussion and conclusions High-quality RWD, especially those derived from long-term disease registries, are of increasing importance from regulatory and reimbursement perspectives, requiring owners to provide data of comparable quality to clinical trials. The framework presented herein responds to the call for transparency in real-world analyses and allows doctors and patients to experience an immediate benefit of the collected data for individualized optimal care. Lay Summary Workflows of doctors treating patients in medical offices have changed dramatically in recent years. Computers have replaced paper files, and physicians rely on sophisticated digital systems to keep track of data from many sources, including laboratory results and patient-reported outcomes collected using tablets and smartphones. Data collected through these efforts are termed real-world data, because they reflect actual healthcare encounters in daily practice. Too often, such data constitute an untapped resource for learning, because the results from individual patients are kept decentralized. When kept separately, it is not possible to understand if certain groups of patients may respond better or worse to certain treatments. Physicians in the NeuroTransData network in Germany decided to remove the barriers for learning by connecting their practices. They now all contribute data to a central data collection called a registry. Personally identifying information is replaced with codes to protect privacy, and the data are checked automatically for errors to ensure that no mistakes are introduced. We describe the processes to collect, handle, and analyze real-world data in this network to support scientific studies with data of high quality and to allow insights derived from the data to directly benefit the patients in the network.","[Wehrle, Knut; Braune, Stefan; Rossnagel, Fabian; Dikow, Heidi; Bergmann, Arnfin] NeuroTransData GmbH, NTD Study Grp, Bahnhofstr 103B, D-86633 Neuburg, Germany; [Tozzi, Viola; Paddock, Silvia; van Hoevell, Philip] PricewaterhouseCoopers AG, Zurich, Switzerland",,"Wehrle, K (corresponding author), NeuroTransData GmbH, NTD Study Grp, Bahnhofstr 103B, D-86633 Neuburg, Germany.",kwehrle@neurotransdata.com,,,PwC; NTD,PwC; NTD,This project was jointly funded by PwC and NTD.,,18,1,1,0,1,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",,2574-2531,,JAMIA OPEN,JAMIA Open,JAN 7,2022,5,1,,,,,,,ooac017,10.1093/jamiaopen/ooac017,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jamiaopen/ooac017,,,9,Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,ZP3CS,35571355,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-02-20,WOS:000766301400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Its prevalence has had a powerful impact in healthcare, with numerous applications and intelligent systems achieving clinical level expertise. However, building robust and generalizable systems relies on training algorithms in a centralized fashion using large, heterogeneous datasets. In medicine, these datasets are time consuming to annotate and difficult to collect centrally due to privacy concerns. Recently, Federated Learning has been proposed as a distributed learning technique to alleviate many of these privacy concerns by providing a decentralized training paradigm for models using large, distributed data. This new approach has become the defacto way of building machine learning models in multiple industries (e.g. edge computing, smartphones). Due to its strong potential, Federated Learning is also becoming a popular training method in healthcare, where patient privacy is of paramount concern. In this paper we performed an extensive literature review to identify state-of-the-art Federated Learning applications for cancer research and clinical oncology analysis. Our objective is to provide readers with an overview of the evolving Federated Learning landscape, with a focus on applications and algorithms in oncology space. Moreover, we hope that this review will help readers to identify potential needs and future directions for research and development.","[Chowdhury, Alexander; Umeton, Renato] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Boston, MA USA; [Umeton, Renato] MIT, Cambridge, MA USA; [Kassem, Hasan; Padoy, Nicolas; Karargyris, Alexandros] Univ Strasbourg, ICube, CNRS, Strasbourg, France; [Padoy, Nicolas; Karargyris, Alexandros] IHU Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France; [Umeton, Renato] Weill Cornell Med, New York, NY USA; [Umeton, Renato] Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Boston, MA USA",Harvard University; Dana-Farber Cancer Institute; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg; Cornell University; Weill Cornell Medicine; Harvard University; Harvard T.H.

A decrease in cAMP levels, due to the hydrolyzing activity of phosphodiesterases (PDE), is favoring inflammatory responses. This can be prevented by selective PDE inhibitors, which makes PDEs important therapeutic targets for autoimmune disorders. In this study, we investigated the specific roles of PDE2A and PDE3B in the regulation of intracellular cAMP levels in different mouse T cell subsets. Unexpectedly, T cell receptor (TCR) activation led to a selective upregulation of PDE2A at the protein level in conventional T cells (Tcon), whereas no changes were detected in regulatory T cells (Treg). In contrast, protein expression of PDE3B was significantly higher in both non-activated and activated Tcon subsets as compared to Treg, with no changes upon TCR engagement. Live-cell imaging of T cells expressing a highly sensitive Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based biosensor, Epac1-camps, has enabled cAMP measurements in real time and revealed stronger responses to the PDE2A inhibitors in activated vs non-activated Tcon. Importantly, stimulation of intracellular cGMP levels with natriuretic peptides led to an increase of cAMP in non-activated and a decrease of cAMP in activated Tcon, suggesting that TCR activation changes the PDE3B-dependent positive to PDE2A-dependent negative cGMP/cAMP cross-talk. Functionally, this switch induced higher expression of early activation markers CD25 and CD69. This constitutes a potentially interesting feed-forward mechanism during autoimmune and inflammatory responses that may be exploited therapeutically.","[Kurelic, Roberta; Bhaiyan, Gloria; Nikolaev, Viacheslav O.] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Inst Expt Cardiovasc Res, Hamburg, Germany; [Krieg, Paula F.; Sonner, Jana K.; Friese, Manuel A.] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Ctr Mol Neurobiol Hamburg, Inst Neuroimmunol & Multiple Sclerosis, Hamburg, Germany; [Ramos, Gustavo C.; Frantz, Stefan] Univ Hosp Wurzburg, Dept Internal Med 1, Wurzburg, Germany; [Ramos, Gustavo C.; Frantz, Stefan] Univ Hosp Wurzburg, ComprehensWe Heart Failure Ctr, Wurzburg, Germany; [Nikolaev, Viacheslav O.] German Ctr Cardiovasc Res DZHK, Partner Site Hamburg Kiel Lubeck, Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg; University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf; University of Hamburg; University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf; University of Wurzburg; University of Wurzburg; German Centre for Cardiovascular Research,"Nikolaev, VO (corresponding author), Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Inst Expt Cardiovasc Res, Hamburg, Germany.;Nikolaev, VO (corresponding author), German Ctr Cardiovasc Res DZHK, Partner Site Hamburg Kiel Lubeck, Hamburg, Germany.",v.nikolaev@uke.de,"Frantz, Stefan/G-1723-2012","Friese, Manuel A./0000-0001-6380-2420",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SFB1328],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)),This study was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (grant SFB1328 to MAF and VON).,,49,4,4,1,6,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,1663-9812,,FRONT PHARMACOL,Front.

For individuals who face barriers to care assessment, there is a need for remote administration or self-administration of physical performance measures that assess mobility to determine current functional status and to monitor and predict future changes in functional status. The primary purpose of this review is to evaluate the available measurement properties of scores for remotely or self-administered lower extremity mobility performance measures in adults. This review also outlines the test procedures and population suitability of these measures. Methods. Data sources were Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, EBSCOhost CINAHL, Ovid AMED, and Cochrane CENTRAL- which were searched from inception to January 26, 2021-and the reference lists of relevant studies. Two individuals independently screened studies that assessed at least 1 prespecified measurement property of scores for a remote and/or self-administered lower extremity physical performance measure assessing mobility in an adult population. Two individuals independently extracted data on study characteristics, measurement properties, feasibility, and interpretability using piloted extraction forms. The COSMIN (COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments) Risk of Bias tool was used to assess methodological quality. Data were qualitatively summarized, and results were compared against COSMIN's criteria for good measurement properties. Level of evidence was determined using COSMIN's modified GRADE approach. Results. Fourteen studies detailing 19 outcome measures were included. Many studies displayed sufficient measurement properties based on COSMIN's criteria; however, risk of bias for most of the included studies was rated adequate or doubtful. Conclusion. Clinicians and researchers can consider the measurement properties of scores and feasibility of different approaches presented in this review when determining how to assess or monitor mobility in adult populations. Impact. Assessing mobility via remote or self-administered physical performance measures in adult populations appears to be feasible using a variety of methods including simple tools (chair, stopwatch), videoconferencing, and smartphone applications. This strategy may be particularly valuable for self-management of chronic conditions and decreasing barriers to accessing care.","[Morgan, Ashley; Begin, Diane; Tang, Ada; Richardson, Julie] McMaster Univ, Sch Rehabil Sci, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Heisz, Jennifer] McMaster Univ, Dept Kinesiol, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Thabane, Lehana; Richardson, Julie] McMaster Univ, Dept Hlth Res Methods Evidence & Impact HEI, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Thabane, Lehana] St Josephs Healthcare, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Thabane, Lehana] Univ Johannesburg, Fac Hlth Sci, Johannesburg, South Africa",McMaster University; McMaster University; McMaster University; University of Johannesburg,"Richardson, J (corresponding author), McMaster Univ, Sch Rehabil Sci, Hamilton, ON, Canada.;Richardson, J (corresponding author), McMaster Univ, Dept Hlth Res Methods Evidence & Impact HEI, Hamilton, ON, Canada.",jrichard@mcmaster.ca,"; Tang, Ada/ABB-3357-2021","Begin, Deedee/0000-0001-8040-6868; Thabane, Lehana/0000-0003-0355-9734; Richardson, Julie Anne/0000-0001-6356-0492; Tang, Ada/0000-0002-6641-4017",,,,,70,0,0,1,1,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0031-9023,1538-6724,,PHYS THER,Phys.

Any proposed cure needs to address the many aspects of the disease. Stem cell therapy may have potential in this regard as indicated in recent preclinical and clinical studies. Objective: This protocol aims to examine the safety and therapeutic benefit of human Wharton jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cells (WJ-MScs) and their derivatives, neuronal stem cells (NSCs) in PD. Methods: This clinical trial is a double-arm, single-blinded, phase I-II interventional study. Participants have been allocated to 1 of 2 groups: one receiving allogeneic WJ-MSCs alone, the other receiving NSCs and WJ-MScs. Participants are being followed-up and assessed over a period of 6 months. To assess safety, an incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) tool tailored for PD is being used immediately and up to 6 months after treatment. For efficacy assessment, a number of factors are being used, including the gold standard severity test and the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale. In addition, the following standardized assessments for different common symptoms in PD are being included: motor (both subjectively and objectively assessed with wearable sensors), sensory, quality of life and psychological well-being, cognition, and sleep quality. Furthermore, immune-modulatory cytokines and neuronal damage versus regeneration markers in PD, including the neuronal protein linked to PD, alpha-synuclein, are being monitored. Results: Ten patients have been enrolled in this study and thus participant recruitment has been completed. The study status is active and beyond the recruiting stage. Study chart implementation, data collection, and analysis are ongoing. Conclusions: The combination of NSCs and MSCs in PD may be useful for harnessing the best of the immunomodulation and neural repair characteristics of these cell types. The tailored comprehensive and scaled TEAEs and the variety of evaluation tools used enables a comprehensive assessment of this cellular therapy treatment protocol. A consideration of this expanded tool set is important in the design of future clinical studies for PD.","[Jamali, Fatima; Khasawneh, Mohammad W.; Salameh, Alaa A.; Awidi, Abdalla] Univ Jordan, Cell Therapy Ctr, Queen Rania St, Amman 11942, Jordan; [Aldughmi, Mayis] Univ Jordan, Sch Rehabil Sci, Dept Physiotherapy, Amman, Jordan; [Dahbour, Said] Univ Jordan, Fac Med, Amman, Jordan; [Dahbour, Said] Jordan Univ Hosp, Div Neurol, Amman, Jordan; [Awidi, Abdalla] Jordan Univ Hosp, Dept Hematol, Amman, Jordan",University of Jordan; University of Jordan; University of Jordan; University of Jordan; University of Jordan,"Jamali, F (corresponding author), Univ Jordan, Cell Therapy Ctr, Queen Rania St, Amman 11942, Jordan.",ftmjamali@gmail.com,,"Aldughmi, Mayis/0000-0002-5666-0441; awidi, abdalla/0000-0002-4884-948X; Khasawneh, Mohammad W/0000-0002-9944-2495",Deanship of Scientific Research at the University of Jordan,Deanship of Scientific Research at the University of Jordan,The authors would like to thank Dr Dana Alhattab for her critical review of the protocol.

Sophisticated tools are now available for both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells to engineer cells to selectively achieve therapeutic effects in response to one or more disease-related signals, thus sparing healthy tissue from potentially cytotoxic effects. This report summarizes the Keystone eSymposium Synthetic Biology: At the Crossroads of Genetic Engineering and Human Therapeutics, which took place on May 3 and 4, 2021. Given that several therapies engineered using synthetic biology have entered clinical trials, there was a clear need for a synthetic biology symposium that emphasizes the therapeutic applications of synthetic biology as opposed to the technical aspects. Presenters discussed the use of synthetic biology to improve T cell, gene, and viral therapies, to engineer probiotics, and to expand upon existing modalities and functions of cell-based therapies.","[Leonard, Joshua N.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Chem & Biol Engn, Ctr Synthet Biol, Interdisciplinary Biol Sci Program,Chem Life Proc, Evanston, IL USA; [Leonard, Joshua N.] Northwestern Univ, Robert H Lurie Comprehens Canc Ctr, Evanston, IL USA; [Lu, Timothy K.; Hava, David L.; Chen, William C.

The purpose of the movement-to-music (M2M) study is to address these issues by establishing a remotely delivered, rhythmic exercise program for people with physical disabilities. Methods: The study is a two-arm randomized controlled efficacy trial examining a 12-week remotely delivered M2M intervention (eM2M) in 108 people with physical disabilities. The primary outcomes are changes in cardiorespiratory fitness and muscle strength at post 12-week intervention. Discussion: The eM2M study will enhance our understanding of an alternative intervention design and delivery mode that removes common barriers to exercise participation experienced by people with physical disabilities. The eM2M intervention may be an alternative option for people with physical disabilities to obtain regular exercise, especially during a pandemic when exercising in indoor facilities may be problematic.","[Young, Hui-Ju; Lai, Byron; Mehta, Tapan; Thirumalai, Mohanraj; Wilroy, Jereme; Yates, Alex; Kane, Brandon; Rimmer, James H.] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Sch Hlth Profess, UAB Lakeshore Res Collaborat, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; [Lai, Byron] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Sch Med, Div Pediat & Rehabil Med, Birmingham, AL USA; [Mehta, Tapan; Thirumalai, Mohanraj] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Sch Hlth Profess, Dept Hlth Serv Adm, Birmingham, AL USA; [Wilroy, Jereme] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Sch Med, Dept Phys Med & Rehabil, Birmingham, AL USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Birmingham; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Birmingham; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Birmingham; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Birmingham,"Young, HJ (corresponding author), Univ Alabama Birmingham, Sch Hlth Profess, UAB Lakeshore Res Collaborat, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA.",hjyoung@uab.edu,,"Young, Hui-Ju/0000-0001-6115-4650","National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research (NIDILRR) [90DPGE0005]; NIDILRR [90DPGE0005, 1098626] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER","National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research (NIDILRR)(United States Department of Health & Human Services); NIDILRR(United States Department of Health & Human Services)","The contents of this manuscript were developed under a grant from the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research (NIDILRR grant number 90DPGE0005).

Developments in optic nerve imaging have specifically improved the care of patients with papilloedema and idiopathic intracranial hypertension, inflammatory optic neuropathies, and compressive optic neuropathies. For example, optic nerve imaging with optical coherence tomography (OCT) is now widely used as an outcome measure in clinical trials of neurological disorders (eg, demyelinating diseases), and OCT findings could be informative of disease progression in patients with various neurodegenerative disorders (eg, Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease). In the past 5 years, multimodality optic nerve imaging has expanded to systematically include focused and wide-field colour and autofluorescence fiindus photographs; various types of optic nerve, macular, and vascular OCT; and specific MRI techniques. Such multimodality imaging makes the diagnosis of optic neuropathies easier and provides objective information on optic nerve damage, which is useful for prognosis. Non-rnydriatic ocular fundus cameras and OCT have become readily available in non-ophthalmic settings and could easily be implemented in neurological clinics and emergency departments, allowing for direct access to optic nerve imaging and enabling teleconsultations. In the future, these imaging studies could be used in association with artificial intelligence deeplearning systems, which are already transforming the field of ocular imaging.","[Biousse, Valerie; Newman, Nancy J.] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Ophthalmol, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Biousse, Valerie; Newman, Nancy J.] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Saindane, Amit M.] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Radiol, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Saindane, Amit M.; Newman, Nancy J.] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurol Surg, Atlanta, GA USA; [Danesh-Meyer, Helen V.] Univ Auckland, Dept Ophthalmol, Auckland, New Zealand; [Lamirel, Cedric] Hop Fdn Adolphe Rothschild, Dept Ophthalmol, Paris, France",Emory University; Emory University; Emory University; Emory University; University of Auckland; Fondation Adolphe de Rothschild,"Biousse, V (corresponding author), Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Ophthalmol, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",vbiouss@emory.edu,,,National Institutes of Health (NIH)/National Eye Institute [P30-EY06360]; Research to Prevent Blindness,National Institutes of Health (NIH)/National Eye Institute(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI)); Research to Prevent Blindness(Research to Prevent Blindness (RPB)),"There was no funding for this manuscript.
