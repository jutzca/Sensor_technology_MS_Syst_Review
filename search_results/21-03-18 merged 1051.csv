Reasons are given for measuring this particular parameter of the tremor, for using this specific energy conversion device and for employing the particular form of analysis. A comparison of the numerical values obtained for the amount of tremor activity, compared with a corresponding clinical grading, is made for 30 patients with intention tremor due to a variety of pathological causes. It is shown that the method gives clear correlation with the clinical assessments, although certain discrepancies are noted, and their importance discussed.","Article","10.1136/JNNP.38.3.253","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=00223050&id=doi:10.1136%2Fjnnp.38.3.253&atitle=Intention+tremor%3A+a+method+of+measurement&stitle=J.+NEUROL.+NEUROSURG.+PSYCHIATRY&title=Journal+of+Neurology+Neurosurgery+and+Psychiatry&volume=38&issue=3&spage=253&epage=258&aulast=Morgan&aufirst=M.H.&auinit=M.H.&aufull=Morgan+M.H.&coden=JNNPA&isbn=&pages=253-258&date=1975&auinit1=M&auinitm=H","Embase"

Resting, postural and intentional tremor were recorded by an accelerometer in 50 patients (Parkinsonism, essential tremor, alcoholism and multiple sclerosis) and in 8 normals. Typical in Parkinsonism, is a resting tremor with a frequency of less than 5 Hz. The Parkinsonian postural tremor is of 2 types, accentuated normal tremor, and Parkinsonian type. In benign essential tremor, a postural tremor with frequency of 6 to 8 Hz was usual. The alcoholics have an accentuated normal tremor, and multiple sclerosis patients have both postural and intentional tremor, without any special characteristics. Nearly all the normals have postural tremor with small amplitude and frequency of 8 to 10 Hz.

Patients on dialysis have reduced exercise tolerance compared with age-matched sedentary controls. The reasons for this debility have not been fully elucidated, but physical inactivity could be a contributing factor. The purpose of the current study was to determine whether patients on hemodialysis are less active than healthy sedentary controls and to explore clinical correlates of physical activity level in a group of hemodialysis patients. Methods. Thirty-four hemodialysis patients and 80 healthy sedentary individuals participated in the study. Physical activity was measured for seven days with a three-dimensional accelerometer and with an activity questionnaire. Results. Vector magnitude values from the accelerometer for the dialysis and control subjects were 104,718 +/- 9631 and 161,255 +/- 6792 arbitrary units per day, respectively (P < 0.0001, mean +/- SEM). The estimated energy expenditure values derived from the questionnaire were 33.6 +/- 0.5 kcal/kg/day and 36.2 +/- 0.5 kcal/kg/day (P = 0.002). The difference between patients on dialysis and controls increased with advancing age. Among the dialysis subjects, some measures of nutritional status correlated with physical activity level, including serum albumin concentration (r = 0.58, P = 0.003), serum creatinine concentration (r = 0.37, P = 0.03), and phase angle derived from bioelectrical impedance analysis (r = 0.40, P = 0.02). Conclusions. Patients on hemodialysis are less active than healthy sedentary controls, and this difference is more pronounced among older individuals. There is an association between the level of physical activity and nutritional status among patients on dialysis. These findings are of great concern, given the trend toward increasing age in incident dialysis patients and the well-known association between inactivity and increased mortality in the general population.","Article; Proceedings Paper","10.1046/J.1523-1755.2000.00116.X","WOS:000087346100038","WoS"

Twenty-four multiple sclerosis patients were included in the study; 13 underwent surgery and were matched against 11 controls on the basis of age, sex, expanded disability system scores (EDSS) and disease duration. Assessments were carried out at baseline/preoperatively, and then 3 and 12 months later; these included accelerometric and clinical ratings of tremor, spirography, handwriting, a finger-tapping test, nine-hole peg test, tremor-related disability, general neurological examination, Barthel Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Index of general disability, EDSS, a 0-4 ataxia scale, Mini-Mental State (MMS) examination, speech and swallowing assessments and grip strength. Postoperative MRI scans demonstrated that tremor could be attenuated by lesions centred on the thalamus in seven cases, on the zona incerta in five cases and in the subthalamic nucleus in one case. Two patients developed hemiparesis and in two cases epilepsy recurred. Two surgical patients and one control patient died between the 3 and 6 months assessments. Both groups had a significant deterioration in EDSS but not Barthel ADL Index scores at 1 year, but the difference between the groups was not significant. Similarly, no differences between the groups' rates of deterioration of speech or swallowing or MMS were found. Significant improvements in contralateral upper limb postural (P2) and kinetic tremors, spiral scores and head tremor were detected at 3 and 12 months after surgery (but not handwriting or nine-hole peg test performance). Tremor-related disability and finger-tapping speed were also significantly better 12 months after surgery, the latter having significantly worsened for the control group. A 3 Hz 'filter' for postural (P2) upper limb tremor was detected by accelerometry/spectral analysis above which tremor was always abolished and at or below which some residual tremor invariably remained.

Postoperative MRI scans demonstrated that tremor could be attenuated by lesions centred on the thalamus in seven cases, on the zona incerta in five cases and in the subthalamic nucleus in one case. Two patients developed hemiparesis and in two cases epilepsy recurred. Two surgical patients and one control patient died between the 3 and 6 months assessments. Both groups had a significant deterioration in EDSS but not Barthel ADL Index scores at 1 year, but the difference between the groups was not significant. Similarly, no differences between the groups' rates of deterioration of speech or swallowing or MMS were found. Significant improvements in contralateral upper limb postural (P2) and kinetic tremors, spiral scores and head tremor were detected at 3 and 12 months after surgery (but not handwriting or nine-hole peg test performance). Tremor-related disability and fingertapping speed were also significantly better 12 months after surgery, the latter having significantly worsened for the control group. A 3 Hz 'filter' for postural (P2) upper limb tremor was detected by accelerometry/spectral analysis above which tremor was always abolished and at or below which some residual tremor invariably remained. Criteria for selecting multiple sclerosis patients for this form of surgery are discussed.","Article",NA,"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=00068950&id=doi:&atitle=Stereotactic+lesional+surgery+for+the+treatment+of+tremor+in+multiple+sclerosis+a+prospective+case-controlled+study&stitle=Brain&title=Brain&volume=124&issue=8&spage=1576&epage=1589&aulast=Alusi&aufirst=S.H.&auinit=S.H.&aufull=Alusi+S.H.&coden=BRAIA&isbn=&pages=1576-1589&date=2001&auinit1=S&auinitm=H","Embase"

In this study, we have investigated the effect of IFN-kappa on cells of the innate immune system by comparing cytokine release following treatment of human cells with either IFN-kappa or two recombinant IFN subtypes, IFN-beta and IFN-alpha2a. Although IFN-alpha2a failed to stimulate monocyte cytokine secretion, IFN-kappa, like IFN-beta, induced the release of several cytokines from both monocytes and dendritic cells, without the requirement of a costimulatory signal. IFN-kappa was particularly effective in inhibiting inducible IL-12 release from monocytes. Unlike IFN-beta, IFN-kappa did not induce release of IFN-gamma by PBL. Expression of the IFN-kappa mRNA was observed in resting dendritic cells and monocytes, and it was up-regulated by IFN-gamma stimulation in monocytes, while IFN-beta mRNA was minimally detectable under the same conditions. Monocyte and dendritic cell expression of IFN-kappa was also confirmed in vivo in chronic lesions of psoriasis vulgaris and atopic dermatitis. Finally, biosensor-based binding kinetic analysis revealed that IFN-kappa, like IFN-beta, binds strongly to heparin (K-d: 2.1 nM), suggesting that the cytokine can be retained close to the local site of production. The pattern of cytokines induced by IFN-kappa in monocytes, coupled with the unique induction of IFN-kappa mRNA by IFN-gamma, indicates a potential role for IFN-kappa in the regulation of immune cell functions.","Article","10.4049/JIMMUNOL.169.9.4822","WOS:000178777400018","WoS"

Data from animal model experiments and subjective and small objective studies involving patients suggest that cannabis may be an effective treatment for tremor associated with MS. To our knowledge, there are no published double-blind randomized controlled trials of cannabis as a treatment for tremor in MS patients. Methods: The authors conducted a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial to examine the effect of oral cannador (cannabis extract) on 14 patients with MS with upper limb tremors. There were eight women and six men, with a mean age of 45 years and mean Expanded Disability Status Scale score of 6.25. Patients were randomly assigned to receive each treatment and the doses escalated over a 2-week period before each assessment. The primary outcome was change on a tremor index, measured using a validated tremor rating scale. The study was powered to detect a functionally significant 50% improvement in the tremor index. Secondary outcomes included accelerometry, an ataxia scale, spiral drawing, finger tapping, and nine-hole pegboard test performance. Results: Analysis of the data showed no significant improvement in any of the objective measures of upper limb tremor with cannabis extract compared to placebo. Finger tapping was faster on placebo compared to cannabis extract (p < 0.02). However, there was a nonsignificant trend for patients to experience more subjective relief from their tremors while on cannabis extract compared to placebo.

How this network responds to motor training is not known. This study examined functional MRI (fMRI) activation patterns associated with performance of a motor task, consisting of repetition of directionally specific voluntary thumb movements, before and after motor training in a group of multiple sclerosis patients with mild motor impairment of the right upper extremity. Patients and healthy subjects were scanned in one session before, during and after a 30 min training period. fMRI data obtained during rest, thumb flexion (trained movement) and thumb extension (untrained movement) were analysed using random effects analysis (SPM99). Motor kinematics of training motions and EMG from the resting hand were monitored with an accelerometer and surface EMG electrodes. Kinematics of thumb movements before, during and after training were comparable in the absence of mirror EMG activity in the resting hand. Before training, thumb movements elicited more prominent activation of the contralateral dorsal premotor cortex [PMd, Brodmann area (BA) 6] in multiple sclerosis patients than in controls. After training, unlike the control group, multiple sclerosis patients did not exhibit task-specific reductions in activation in the contralateral primary somatosensory (S1), motor (M1) and adjacent parietal association (BA 40) cortices. These results indicate that patients engage the contralateral PMd more than controls in order to perform directionally specific movements before training. The absence of training-dependent reductions in activation in S1, M1 and BA 40 is consistent with a decreased capacity to optimize recruitment of the motor network with practice.","Article","10.1093/BRAIN/AWH266","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=00068950&id=doi:10.1093%2Fbrain%2Fawh266&atitle=Training-dependent+plasticity+in+patients+with+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Brain&title=Brain&volume=127&issue=11&spage=2506&epage=2517&aulast=Morgen&aufirst=Katrin&auinit=K.&aufull=Morgen+K.&coden=BRAIA&isbn=&pages=2506-2517&date=2004&auinit1=K&auinitm=","Embase"

Objective: To present a survey and demonstrate the contribution of neurophysiological assessment of side effects and effects on disabling motor symptoms at various steps of DBS surgery, and to confirm its role for optimal target localization, as an adjuvant to anatomic imaging. Material and methods: The data result from 192 nuclei in 118 procedures on patients with Parkinson's disease (84), essential tremor (24), Hallenvorder Spatz dystonia (4), multiple sclerosis (4), and Holmes tremor (2). The intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IOM) protocol consists of semimicroelectrode recording (for subthalamic nuclei), whereas accelerotransducers and spectral analysis allow assessment of tremor, finger tapping (FT), diadochokinesis (DDK), and determination of the distance between DBS electrodes and internal capsule (IC). Rigidity is assessed by surface EMG recordings in combination with a goniometer. Results: The determination of the functional distance between the DBS electrode and the IC is based on the activation functions of axons in the IC. We show the high sensitivity of accelerometers for tremor over a large part of the body, the relationship between clinical scores and spectral frequencies of FT and DDK. Parkinsonian rigidity can be assessed from surface EMG (sEMG) by means of a balance coefficient, which can detect negative rigidity, for low unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) scores (0-2) and quantified EMG when negative rigidity is excluded. Conclusion: Accelerometer and sEMG recording have shown their value for intraoperative assessment of disabling motor symptoms and side effects during surgery, to optimize the target position electrodes for DBS. The combination with contemporary signal analyzing techniques permit intraoperative monitoring without a significant delay. IONM improves sensitivity and adds objective neurophysiological data. © 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS.

In both disorders, motor disability results from complex interaction between kinetic tremor and accompanying ataxia with voluntary movements. In clinical studies, the efficacy of thalamic DBS has been thoroughly assessed. However, the optimal anatomical target structure for neurostimulation is still debated and has never been analysed in conjunction with objective measurements of the different aspects of motor impairment. In 10 essential tremor and 11 multiple sclerosis patients, we analysed the effect of thalamic DBS through each contact of the quadripolar electrode on the contralateral tremor rating scale, accelerometry and kinematic measures of reach-to-grasp-movements. These measures were correlated with the anatomical position of the stimulating electrode in stereotactic space and in relation to nuclear boundaries derived from intraoperative microrecording.We found a significant impact of the stereotactic z-coordinate of stimulation contacts on the TRS, accelerometry total power and spatial deviation in the deceleration and target period of reach-to-grasp- movements. Most effective contacts clustered within the subthalamic area (STA) covering the posterior Zona incerta and prelemniscal radiation. Stimulation within this region led to a mean reduction of the lateralized tremor rating scale by 15.8 points which was significantly superior to stimulation within the thalamus (P < 0.05, student's t-test). STA stimulation resulted in reduction of the accelerometry total power by 99%, whereas stimulation at the ventral thalamic border (68%) or within the thalamus proper (2.5%) was significantly less effective (P < 0.01). Concomitantly, STA stimulation led to a significantly higher increase of tremor frequency and decrease in EMG synchronization compared to stimulation within the thalamus proper (P < 0.001). In reach-to-grasp movements, STA stimulation reduced the spatial variability of the movement path in the deceleration period by 28.9% and in the target period by 58.4%, whereas stimulation within the thalamus was again significantly less effective (P < 0.05), with a reduction in the deceleration period between 6.5 and 21.8% and in the target period between 1.2 and 11.3%. An analysis of the nuclear boundaries from intraoperative microrecording confirmed the anatomical impression that most effective electrodes were located within the STA.Our data demonstrate a profound effect of deep brain stimulation of the thalamic region on tremor and ataxia in essential tremor and tremor caused by multiple sclerosis. The better efficacy of stimulation within the STA compared to thalamus proper favours the concept of a modulation of cerebello-thalamic projections underlying the improvement of these symptoms. © The Author (2007).

Self-report instruments are commonly used to measure activity patterns; alternatively, actigraphs can be placed on several parts of the body. The aims of this study were to evaluate the superiority and specificity of actigraph placement ( wrist vs. ankle) in subjects with MS and healthy controls and explore the relationship between self-report and objective activity patterns. A total of 19 subjects with definite MS and 10 healthy volunteers wore actigraphs on the non-dominant wrist and ankle for three days while they kept a log to register performed activities every .5 h. Wrist and ankle actigraphs produced similar activity patterns during the most active hours (09:00-20:30 h) (ANOVA, time x location interaction: F = .901, df = 23, p = .597) in individuals with MS and healthy controls (between subjects factor F = 3.275, p = .083). Wrist placement of the actigraphs was better tolerated than ankle placement. Wrist actigraph data corresponded to a higher degree with self-reported activities of the upper limbs in the early afternoon, whereas ankle data seem to reflect better whole body movements in the later afternoon/early evening. Overall, actigraph data correlated moderately with self-reported activity (r = .57 for ankle and r = .59 for wrist). The regression model revealed that self-reported activities explained 44% of the variance in ankle and 50% of wrist data. Wrist and ankle actigraphs produce similar activity patterns in subjects with MS and in healthy controls; however, the placement of actigraphs on the wrist is better tolerated. Ankle actigraphs reflect general movement but underestimate upper body activity. Subjective registration of activity level partly matches with objective actigraph measurement. A combination of both objective and subjective activity registration is recommended to evaluate the physical activity pattern of subjects with MS.","Article; Proceedings Paper","10.1080/07420520701282364","WOS:000246297100010","WoS"

We then developed algorithms to automatically distinguish between different stages of activity, such as jogging, walking, lying, standing and sitting, and to detect and count steps. Distinction between standing and sitting is the most difficult to accomplish.

Design: Participants completed the PADS twice with seven days between repeated measures, while also wearing an Actical accelerometer. Semi-structured interview questions were used to explore the acceptability of the PADS. Subjects: Thirty participants were recruited from the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Auckland, New Zealand. Mean age of participants was 54 years (range 27-76). Main measures: Physical Activity and Disability Survey (PADS) and Actical accelerometer. Results: A wide range of standardized PADS scores were recorded at each time-point (ranges 6.7-83.3 and 6.7-87.4). While standardized PADS scores between time-points had a high intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.92 (95% confidence interval (Cl) 0.88, 0.98), Bland-Altman 95% limits of agreement (- 17.4, 17.4) were modest.

We assessed serial samples of 18 MS patients, treated with IFN-β for between 66 and 198 months, to characterize the affinity maturation of these antibodies using a biosensor-based approach (Biacore™). Biacore utilizes the principles of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) with data from the dissociation phase of the antigen-antibody reaction being inversely proportional to relative antibody affinity. In patients with neutralizing antibodies (NAbs+), mean antibody dissociation rates decreased from 0.00118 ± 0.00030 s(-1) at month 6 to 0.00021 ± 0.00008 s(-1) at month 36, followed by a slight increase to 0.00027 ± 0.00003 s(-1) at month 60. In NAb- patients, mean antibody dissociation rates decreased only very slightly from 0.00130 ± 0.00025 s(-1) to 0.00105 ± 0.00020 s(-1) at month 18, followed by a gradual increase to 0.00243 ± 0.00099 s(-1) at month 60. Our study shows little improvement in antibody affinity in NAb- patients, in contrast to a marked increase in antibody affinity over time in NAb+ patients with a significant correlation between NAb titers and relative antibody dissociation rates (Spearman's correlation, R(2) = -0.374, p < 0.001).

We correlated the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and the Fugl-Meyer Assessment arm section (FMA) findings with actigraphic data as a measure of validity. Methods: Thirty-nine acute ischemic stroke patients were included within 1 week after stroke onset. At inclusion, motor deficits were assessed by the NIHSS, FMA and 48-hour actigraphic recordings of both wrists were performed. Results: Moderate but highly significant correlations (Spearman's rho) between actigraphic recordings and total NIHSS (ratio r = -0.59 and activity of impaired arm r = -0.75; p < 0.001) and FMA (ratio r = 0.54 and activity of impaired arm r = 0.69; p < 0.001) scores were found. Based on actigraphic motor activity scores, ROC curves were calculated following dichotomization of the population based on NIHSS = 7 and FMA = 45, showing good sensitivity and specificity, with negative predictive value of 100% and positive predictive value of 91% for the ratio variable. Conclusions: Moderate but highly significant correlations were found between actigraphy and the stroke scales NIHSS and FMA. Actigraphy was able to reliably discriminate less impaired from more impaired stroke patients with excellent sensitivity and specificity values. Actigraphy is a simple, valid, objective and reliable clinical research tool that can be used to determine motor impairment of the upper limb in stroke patients. Copyright © 2008 S.

Design: Exploratory, descriptive study. Subjects: Thirty individuals with multiple sclerosis and nine controls. Protocol: Individuals with multiple sclerosis were recruited to inactive, moderately active and active groups as defined by Adjusted Activity Scores from the Human Activity Profile. Control participants were recruited to an active group. Free-living physical activity was recorded over four consecutive days. Main measures: A TriTrac RT3 accelerometer and a self-report physical activity diary were used to measure activity. Results: Thirty-six participants completed data collection. For the participants with multiple sclerosis, both the accelerometer (P=0.004) and the diary (P=0.006) detected significant differences between inactive and active groups. The accelerometer also detected a significant difference between moderately active and active groups (P=0.04). In contrast, the diary detected a significant difference between inactive and moderately active groups (P=0.05). Accelerometer and diary scores were significantly correlated (r=0.59). Accelerometer scores were significantly correlated with neurological status (r(s), = -0.64). Conclusions: Both measures readily differentiated least active from most active groups.

The investigations have used either generic or disease-targeted instruments for measuring QOL and HRQL, but have not examined differences in the associations as a function of the types of instruments. Purpose: The present study examined the associations among physical activity, QOL, and HRQL using generic and disease-targeted instruments in persons with multiple sclerosis (MS). Methods: Participants were 292 individuals with MS who wore an accelerometer for 7 days and then completed the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ), Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale-29 (MSIS-29), Leeds Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life Scale (LMSQOL), Short Form-12 Health Survey (SF-12), and Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS). Results: Accelerometer counts and GLTEQ scores had similarly sized correlations with scores from generic (SF-12) and the disease-specific (MSIS-29) measures of HRQL and generic (SWLS) and the disease-specific (LMSQOL) measures of QOL. Path analysis indicated a similar pattern of directional relationships between accelerometer counts and GLTEQ scores with physical and mental HRQL and, in turn, physical and mental HRQL with QOL using generic and disease-targeted instruments.

This type of measurement device has many different possible applications, ranging from clinical use with patients presenting a number of conditions such as upper motor neuron syndrome and pathologies that give rise to loss of dexterity, to competitive sports training and virtual reality. Here we focus on a design that minimizes the number of sensors whilst delivering estimates of known accuracy over a defined frequency range. Minimizing the sensor count can make the measurement system less obtrusive, as well as minimising cost and reducing the required bandwidth if using a wireless solution. Accurate measurement of movement amplitude up to 15 Hz is required in our immediate application, namely to quantify tremor in multiple sclerosis patients. The drive for low numbers of sensors and good accuracy at higher frequencies leads to a novel design based on composite filters. The simple estimator structure also gives good insight into the fundamental accuracy limitations based on the sensors chosen. This paper defines the underlying mathematics, and quantifies performance for an estimator for shoulder, upper arm, lower arm and hand orientations. Good estimation accuracy up to 15 Hz is indicated, and this with a reduced total sensor count of 18 compared to 24 that would be required for more conventional estimator architectures. © 2006 IEEE.","Article","10.1109/TBME.2007.912647","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=00189294&id=doi:10.1109%2FTBME.2007.912647&atitle=Estimation+of+upper-limb+orientation+based+on+accelerometer+and+gyroscope+measurements&stitle=IEEE+Trans.+Biomed.+Eng.&title=IEEE+Transactions+on+Biomedical+Engineering&volume=55&issue=2&spage=746&epage=754&aulast=Hyde&aufirst=Rick+A.&auinit=R.A.&aufull=Hyde+R.A.&coden=IEBEA&isbn=&pages=746-754&date=2008&auinit1=R&auinitm=A","Embase"

On the basis of the observation that upregulation of the Schwann cell-derived chemokine MCP-1 (CCL2) is a pathologically relevant mechanism for macrophage activation in mice heterozygously deficient for the myelin component P0 (P0+/-), we posed the question of the intracellular signaling cascade involved. By using western blot analysis of peripheral nerve lysates the MAP-kinases extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and MAP kinase/ERK kinase 1/2 (MEK1/ 2) showed an early and constantly increasing activation in P0 mutants. Furthermore, in nerve fibers from the P0+/- mutants, Schwann cell nuclei were much more often positive for phosphorylated ERK1/2 than in nerve fibers from wild type mice. In vitro experiments using the MEK1/ 2-inhibitor CI-1040 decreased ERK1/2-phosphorylation and MCP-1 expression in a Schwann cell-derived cell line. Finally, systemic application of CI-1040 lead to a decreased ERK1/2-phosphorylation and substantially reduced MCP-1-production in peripheral nerves of P0+/- mutant mice. Our study identifies MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling as an important intracellular pathway that connects the Schwann cell mutation with the activation of pathogenetically relevant macrophages in the peripheral nerves. These findings may have important implications for the treatment of inherited peripheral neuropathies in humans. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Article","10.1002/GLIA.20657","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=08941491&id=doi:10.1002%2Fglia.20657&atitle=Increase+of+MCP-1+%28CCL2%29+in+myelin+mutant+Schwann+cells+is+mediated+by+MEK-ERK+signaling+pathway&stitle=GLIA&title=GLIA&volume=56&issue=8&spage=836&epage=843&aulast=Fischer&aufirst=Stefan&auinit=S.&aufull=Fischer+S.&coden=GLIAE&isbn=&pages=836-843&date=2008&auinit1=S&auinitm=","Embase"

Measuring free-living physical activity in adults with and without neurologic dysfunction with a triaxial accelerometer. Objective: To investigate the reliability, validity, and utility of a triaxial accelerometer to measure physical activity in the free-living environment in adults with and without neurologic dysfunction. Design: Repeated-measures design. Setting: General community. Participants: Volunteer sample of 17 men and 30 women (age range, 28-91y) living in the community with stroke of greater than 6 months in duration (n=20), Parkinson disease (n=7), or multiple sclerosis (n=11), and healthy but sedentary controls (n=9). Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Physical activity measured with the TriTrac RT3 accelerometer, 7-day recall questionnaire, and activity diary. Results: The accelerometer reliably measured free-living physical activity (intraclass correlation coefficient, .85; 95% confidence interval, .74-.91; P=.000). The standard error of measurement indicated that a second test would differ from a baseline test by ±23%. Mean daily RT3 data collected in the first 3 days differed significantly from that of the mean daily RT3 data collected over 7 days. The RT3 appeared to distinguish level of mobility better than the 7-day recall questionnaire, and participants found the RT3 to be a user-friendly and acceptable measure of physical activity. Conclusions: The triaxial accelerometer provided a stable measure of free-living physical activity, was found to distinguish between people with varying levels of mobility, and was well tolerated by participants.

There were no differences in physical activity, depression, fatigue, or perceived health status between those using and those not using assistive devices. However, 15% of the participants reported moderate to severe depression, and 40% of participants reported at least mild depression. Depression was strongly correlated to fatigue. Thus, physical activity, depression, fatigue, and perceived health are not associated with walker or cane use in assisted-living facilities. Nevertheless, among all, mild depression is prevalent and strongly correlated to fatigue.","Article","10.1177/0733464808315288","WOS:000257820700007","WoS"

Two algorithms for determining event times for treadmill and overground walking based solely on kinematic data are presented. Kinematic data from treadmill walking trials lasting 20-45 s were collected from three subject populations (healthy young, n = 7; multiple sclerosis, n = 7; stroke, n = 4). Overground walking trials consisted of approximately eight successful passes over two force plates for a healthy subject population (it = 5). Time of heel strike and toe-off were determined using the two new computational techniques and compared to events detected using vertical ground reaction force (GRF) as a gold standard. The two algorithms determined 94% of the treadmill events from healthy subjects within one frame (0.0167 s) of the GRF events. In the impaired populations, 89% of treadmill events were within two frames (0.0334 s) of the GRF events. For overground trials, 98% of events were within two frames. Automatic event detection from the two kinematic-based algorithms will aid researchers by accurately determining gait events during the analysis of treadmill and overground walking (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Overexpression of IL-12 has been correlated to the diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). An immunosensor has been fabricated by electroplating gold onto a disposable printed circuit board (PCB) electrode and immobilizing anti-IL-12 monoclonal antibodies (MAb) onto the surface of the electrode. This approach yields a robust sensor that facilitates reproducible mass fabrication and easy alteration of the electrode shape. Results indicate that this novel PCB sensor can detect IL-12 at physiological levels, <100 fM with f-values of 0.05 (typically <0.0001) in a label-free and rapid manner. A linear (with respect to log concentration) detectable range was achieved. Detection in a complex biological solution is also explored; however, significant loss of dynamic range is noted in the 100% complex solution. The cost effective approach described here can be used potentially for diagnosis of diseases (like MS) with known biomarkers in body fluids and for monitoring physiological levels of biomolecules with healthcare, food, and environmental relevance. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Calibration of accelerometer output for ambulatory adults with multiple sclerosis. Objectives: To examine the association between the rates of accelerometer activity counts and energy expenditure during walking in persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) versus controls and then to calibrate the output of accelerometers for computing time spent in light, moderate, and vigorous physical activity based on common metabolic equivalent unit categories in persons with MS. Design: Mixed-model design. Setting: Laboratory. Participants: People with MS (n=24) and people without MS (n=24) who were similar in age, sex, height, and weight. Interventions: The participants undertook three 6-minute periods of walking at 3.2, 4.8, and 6.4km·h(-1) on a motor-driven treadmill. Main Outcome Measures: Activity counts and energy expenditure were measured with an accelerometer worn on the right hip and open-circuit spirometry, respectively. Results: The results indicated that (1) persons with MS had greater energy expenditure, but not activity counts, during walking on a treadmill than did controls; (2) there was a strong linear relationship between activity counts and energy expenditure during treadmill walking, but the slope of the relationship was steeper in persons with MS than in controls; and (3) the cut-points for light, moderate, and vigorous physical activity were lower in persons with MS than in controls. Conclusions: Such findings provide evidence for a strong linear relationship between activity counts and energy expenditure during walking in persons with MS and cut-points based on counts per minute for quantifying time spent in light, moderate, and vigorous physical activity using accelerometers in this population. © 2009 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine.","Article","10.1016/J.APMR.2009.03.020","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=00039993&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.apmr.2009.03.020&atitle=Calibration+of+Accelerometer+Output+for+Ambulatory+Adults+With+Multiple+Sclerosis&stitle=Arch.+Phys.+Med.+Rehabil.&title=Archives+of+Physical+Medicine+and+Rehabilitation&volume=90&issue=10&spage=1778&epage=1784&aulast=Motl&aufirst=Robert+W.&auinit=R.W.&aufull=Motl+R.W.&coden=APMHA&isbn=&pages=1778-1784&date=2009&auinit1=R&auinitm=W","Embase"

In our earlier experiments, we have evaluated levels of enzyme, free or bound to amyloid beta peptides, in cerebrospinal fluid of people with Alzheimer disease and multiple sclerosis. Total enzyme levels were elevated in Alzheimer disease/multiple sclerosis groups when compared to the controls. The levels of enzyme bound to amyloid beta peptides were small when compared to these of total; however, they were elevated only in patients with Alzheimer disease. On the other hand, these results indicated that the more sensitive methods are needed to quantitatively detect the above-mentioned complexes. In the study, ELISA and optical biosensor based on surface plasmon resonance were combined with new antibodies. These methods were used to analyse new samples of people with Alzheimer disease and of the nondemented controls. A comparison of both the approaches was performed. We suggest that the complex of amyloid beta peptides and of the above-mentioned enzyme in cerebrospinal fluid can be used as a biomarker of Alzheimer disease. Nevertheless, detailed analysis of particular amyloid beta peptide fragments needs to be performed from the point of view of their role in the binding.

Methods: The sample included 133 individuals with MS who completed the SI-L, Performance Scales (PS), EDSS, Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale-12 (MSWS-12), Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale-29 (MSIS-29), and Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ) and then wore an accelerometer for 7 days. The data were analyzed using SPSS, version 16.0. Results: There were large correlations between SI-S and SI-L total and subscale scores and between SI-S, SI-L, and PS total scores. The correlations were similar in magnitude between SI-S, SI-L, and PS scores with EDSS and MSIS-29 scores, but not with MSWS-12, accelerometer, and GLTEQ scores. Discriminant function analysis indicated that SI-S scores better differentiated groups with minimal, moderate, and severe disability than did SI-L and PS scores. Regression analysis indicated that SI-S and SI-L scores explained incrementally more variance in EDSS, MSWS-12, and MSIS-29 scores after accounting for PS scores alone. Conclusion: Such findings provide additional support for the validity of both SI-S and SI-L scores in individuals with MS and support the adoption of either the SI-S or SI-L by clinical MS researchers. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, the specificity of changes in relation to the enzyme over-expression was evaluated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent and surface plasmon resonance sensors. The data indicated pronounced increases in the enzyme levels, specifically to 179% in multiple sclerosis and to 573% in Alzheimer disease when compared to the age-matched controls. Although the differences between both diseases were statistically significant, enzyme levels do not appear to be a highly specific biomarker of Alzheimer disease.

Exploring Actical accelerometers as an objective measure of physical activity in people with multiple sclerosis. Objective: To assess the feasibility, acceptability, and psychometric properties of Actical accelerometers in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). Design: Participants attended 2 testing sessions 7 days apart in which they completed 6 activities ranging in intensity while wearing an Actical accelerometer and Polar heart rate monitor. Perceived exertion was recorded after each activity. Setting: University research center. Participants: People (N=31) with a definite diagnosis of MS were purposefully selected, aiming for diversity in level of reported disability, age, sex, and type of MS. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Actical accelerometer, Polar S810i and RS800sd heart rate monitors, Borg rating of perceived exertion, six-minute walk test (6MWT), 30-second chair stand test. Results: Accelerometers had good feasibility and acceptability in people with MS. Test-retest reliability was poor for sedentary and free-living activities, with low to moderate intraclass correlation coefficients (.00-.75), but was better for more vigorous or rhythmic activities (.85-.90).

Methods: A wearable virtual reality (VR) device was used to create visual feedback cues, responding dynamically to the patient's motion in a feedback fashion, so that they appear to be fixed in space. The device was capable of producing one of two repetitive patterns, the first comprising equally spaced transverse lines (no distinct symmetry), and the second squared black and white tiles in checkerboard arrangement (distinct symmetry, called “glide reflection”). The side-length of the tiles in the second arrangement was equal to the spacing between the transverse lines in the first. Two disjoint groups of randomly selected patients with gait disorders due to MS were each trained with visual feedback cues consisting of one of the two patterns. Ten patients used the transverse lines arrangement while eleven patients used the checkerboard tile arrangement. Patients in the two respective groups were instructed to step between the transverse lines or within alternating black and white tiles. Baseline performance (walking speed and stride length along a 10 m straight track) was measured before device use. Following 20 min training with the device and 10 min rest, performance without the device was measured again and compared to the baseline performance. Results: The average improvement in the group using the visual cue of transverse lines was 7.79 ± 4.24% in walking speed and 7.20 ± 3.92% in stride length. The average improvement in the group using the visual cue of checkerboard tile arrangement was 21.09 ± 18.39% in walking speed and 12.99 ± 11.72% in stride length.

A dynamic model is used to simulate the movements, allowing particular sites to be studied in detail. Initial movement data is presented, comparing analysed EMG data and torque estimated by the dynamic model around the elbow joint. Despite the simple analysis, a good fit was obtained. The dynamic model includes a neuromuscular modelling system which will be used in future work to simulate the interactions between measured movements containing intention tremor and the intention behind them, allowing better understanding of the tremor and creating better descriptions of the tremor.

Methods: Participants wore StepWatch® accelerometer for one week in months 1 and 6; parameters of ambulatory activity levels, endurance and burst activity were assessed. We calculated metabolic equivalents of activity. Further, EDSS (expanded disability status scale), Timed 25 Foot Walk (T25W), Hauser Ambulation Index (HA), Berg Balance Test (BBT), Lower Extremity Motor Coordination test, the MS-Walking Scale (MSWS) and Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) were completed at baseline and at end of study. Participants were monitored by monthly phone calls towards falls. Results: 40 patients enrolled (mean age 55 years, mean baseline EDSS 5.2; range 2.5-6.5). Patients took an average of 6151 (SD:2729) steps/ day. Mean sustained activity over a 30-minute time frame was 16 steps/min (SD:8); mean peak activity 44 steps/min (SD:9). Most ambulation occurred during low to medium activity levels. The two accelerometer measurements did not differ significantly. Baseline EDSS, T25W, HA, BBT and MSWS predicted total step counts and peak activity (p<0.006); highest correlation was found for HA and MSWS. No correlation between fatigue (MFIS) and any parameters of ambulatory activity was observed. On average participants had 4.7 falls/6 months; 26% had no falls, 11% had one fall and 63% had ≥2 falls during the study. There was no significant correlation between ambulatory activity, any of clinical tests or questionnaires and falls. Conclusions: Our study describes ambulatory activity of MS patients with moderate disability and found no change over a 6 month period. Several clinical tests commonly used in MS research and care predicted overall and peak ambulatory activity; highest correlation was noted with simple measurements such as HA and MSWS. No correlation between fatigue and physical activity was observed, which may suggest a poor relation between perceived fatigue and actual physical activity. Finally, neither accelerometer measures nor clinical tests/questionnaires were associated with falls indicating that alternative predictors of falls need to be developed.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458509106962","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13524585&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458509106962&atitle=Predictors+of+community-based+ambulatory+activity%3A+Prospective+six-month+study+of+multiple+sclerosis+patients&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=15&issue=9&spage=S47&epage=S48&aulast=Wundes&aufirst=A.&auinit=A.&aufull=Wundes+A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=S47-S48&date=2009&auinit1=A&auinitm=","Embase"

Various outcome measures, including relapses, disability and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures have been used to demonstrate the efficacy of the different available therapies for multiple sclerosis. Recently, the potential limitations of these measures have received increasing attention, and these have stimulated research into more appropriate and sensitive outcome measures for clinical trials. For example, it has been shown that widely-used MRI measures add little, if any, independent information to that provided by more clinically relevant measures such as relapses and disability. Similarly, the Expanded Disability status Scale (EDSS), which is the most widely-used measure of disability related to multiple sclerosis, is insufficiently sensitive to detect robust changes in disability over the timeframes usually used in clinical trials. An alternative to the EDSS is the Multiple Sclerosis Severity Score (MSSS), a severity scale which relates clinical disability to disease duration. The MSSS was originally developed from a database of nearly ten thousand patients from eleven European countries and Australia and has since been reproduced in an independent dataset of 1134 patients from the placebo arms of randomised clinical trials. Based on the MSSS score, disease severity can be defined, which shows stability over time and may provide evidence-based decision support for patient management. Another alternative to measure disability is the objective quantification of physical activity. There is evidence that recent developments in pervasive computing using tiny accelerometers may have the potential to increase the reliability and precision of motor assessment, especially in the mid-range of the EDSS. The outcome measures discussed have potential use as online tools for evidence-based decision support which are increasingly being used in medical research and clinical decision-making. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Prospects for therapeutic intervention by food components","Mutation Research - Fundamental and Molecular Mechanisms of Mutagenesis",2009,"Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) is a ligand-dependent transcription factor and a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily. Acting as sensors of hormones, vitamins, endogenous metabolites and xenobiotic compounds, the nuclear receptors control the expression of a very large number of genes. PPARγ has been known for some time to regulate adipocyte differentiation, fatty acid storage and glucose metabolism, and is a target of anti-diabetic drugs. More recently, PPARγ has been recognized as playing a fundamentally important role in the immune response through its ability to inhibit the expression of inflammatory cytokines and to direct the differentiation of immune cells towards anti-inflammatory phenotypes. A feature of PPARγ is the structural diversity of its ligands, which encompass endogenous metabolites, dietary compounds and synthetic drugs. The high and increasing incidence of inflammatory and allergic disease, coupled with encouraging results from recent clinical trials, suggest that natural PPARγ agonists found in foods may be beneficial to human health by acting as anti-inflammatory molecules. PPARγ is therefore not only a target of the pharmaceutical industry, but also of great potential interest to the food industry, since it is activated by several natural dietary constituents. The prospects for dietary intervention in inflammatory disease have improved somewhat over the last few years, and are reviewed here. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Reliable devices and measurements are needed to assess the PA of MS patients in daily life and to assess the performance of standard clinical tests in detail. Objective: To assess the association between patients' performance during a set of standard rapid tests and disease status. Method: 25 MS patients performed a predefined set of balance and walking tests including Romberg stance test, Timed Up and Go (TUaG), timed tandem walk (TTW) and 6 Minute Walking Test (6MWT) while wearing a tri-axial accelerometer, the actibelt(R), around their waist. Data of 3 patients were excluded from analysis, since patients required holding assistance during balance tests as a possible bias source. Collected accelerometry data were pre-processed by noise and gravity filtering and compared with MS relevant patient data: EDSS, MS Severity Scale, disease duration and course. Parameters extracted from the acceleration data were: Balancecount, an unbalancing measurement during static tests, and time, speed and distance for the dynamic tests. Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon non-parametric tests were used to assess the association between patient data and accelerometry parameter. Results: Data on 22 patients (16 female, 6 male; mean age 41.5 ± 10.2 years) were available for analysis. Clinical patients characteristics were as follows: EDSS 3.2 ±2.0, disease duration 8.5 ±6.9 yrs, MSSS 4.7 ±3.0, disease course: 10 RRMS, 5 SPMS, 5 PPMS, walking aid was used by 5 patients. Time of unbalancing during a 30sec. Romberg stance test was significantly associated to EDSS levels 0-2.5, 3.0-4.5, 5.0-6.5 (p = 0.042). Respective median times were 0.01s, 0.08s, 0.54s. Patients with SPMS or PPMS had more balance problems compared to RRMS (p = 0.041). Results of TTW are biased by use of walking aids. Therefore, analysis was restricted to patients walking without aids. Patients with EDSS 0-2.5 had less unbalancing than patients with EDSS 3.0-4.5 (median proportion: 0.97 vs. 11.72, p = 0.083). This difference between the two groups was not detectable when performing TUaG and 6MWT. There was a trend association between speed reduction during the 6MWT and MSSS in the subgroup of patients walking without aid (p = 0.07).

This study tested the assumption that a waist-worn accelerometer should capture the intra- and inter-person variation in walking behavior. Twenty-four participants with a neurologist-confirmed diagnosis of MS and who were ambulatory with minimal assistance undertook three 6-min periods of over-ground walking that involved comfortable (CWS) and then slower (SWS) and faster (FWS) walking speeds while wearing ActiGraph, model 7164, accelerometers around the waist and ankle. The experimental manipulation of walking was successful such that the CWS was 76.7±13.0m/min (range=55.6-105.14), whereas the SWS and FWS were 64.3±12.3m/min (range=44.5-90.1) and 89.1±13.8m/min (range=60.9-116.4), respectively. Movement counts from the waist and ankle-worn accelerometer were strongly associated with the manipulation of speed, but the association was stronger for the waist than ankle based on both eta-squared estimates (η(2) values=78 and 46) and the average squared multiple correlations from individual regression analyses (R(2) values=97±04 and 88±21). The bivariate correlation between movement counts from the waist-worn accelerometer and speed of walking (r=823, p=001) was large in magnitude and significantly different (z=3.22, p=001) from that between movement counts from the ankle-worn unit and walking speed (r=549, p=001).

Methods: Patients: Among 62 consecutive MS patients, the subjects with the following characteristics have been selected: 1) MS secondary progressive. 2) EDSS score between 3.5 and 5.5; 3) absence of clinical exacerbation or pharmacological modification during the previous four weeks; 4) presence of balance disorder at the initial clinical assessment. The enrolled patients were randomized in two groups with different treatments: with feedback, and with conventional treatment respectively. The assessment was carried on by a therapist blind regarding the randomization, at the beginning and at the end of the treatment: it consisted on clinical (Tinetti Balance Scale and Berg Balance Scale) and kinematic evaluation (Smart Balance Master). All the patients in both groups were treated for 10 sessions along 5 days (2 daily sessions, 21minutes each one with 4 hours of break) in a shady and quiet room. Treatments: In the feedback group the patients were placed in the corner of the room; the therapist applied on the superior surface of the tongue the device: an accelerometer that underlined the head position and generated as biofeedback a continuous perceptible but painless stimulus; the intra-oral interface was connected to a controller system computerized; during the session the patient received the electric impulse by the interface trying to maintain the stimulus in the middle of the tongue depending on postural modifications. In the conventional group the patients received a standard treatment for balance disturbances. Results: Fifteen patients, entered the study. After ten days of treatment a clinical and kinematic improvement was observed in all patients.

Conclusions: Our preliminary data, on MS patients, seem to confirm previous studies, showing that this new device, based on electro-tactile feedback, is useful for the treatment of balance disorders, but, for the moment, we don't have information to understand if this new treatment is more useful than a conventional therapy.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458510383204","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13524585&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458510383204&atitle=Improving+balance+control+using+electrotactile+biofeedback+in+MS+patients%3A+Preliminary+data&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=16&issue=10&spage=S173&epage=S174&aulast=Tiozzo&aufirst=M.&auinit=M.&aufull=Tiozzo+M.&coden=&isbn=&pages=S173-S174&date=2010&auinit1=M&auinitm=","Embase"

While the limitations of self-report measures are clearly acknowledged, less apparent is attention to the potential limitations of their 'objective' counterparts leading to the assumption that objectivity results in more robust and scientifically valid measurement tools. This article aims to: (1) test this assumption; (2) consider the implications of advocating for a measure on the basis of its objectivity; (3) propose an alternative approach to measure selection. Key findings and implications. A critical evaluation of one 'objective' measure highlights a number of potential limitations suggesting that the apparent willingness to adopt 'objective' measures with little questioning may be misguided. The possible implications of this are discussed and include a risk to the advancement of, and capacity for, knowledge in rehabilitation; or worse, of making clinical decisions based on erroneous conclusions. Conclusions. Characterising a measure on the basis of objectivity (or not) assumes an overly simplistic dichotomy that is unhelpful and perhaps misleading. We argue that assessing whether a measure is fit for purpose and makes mathematical sense is the key consideration. Indeed, in some cases, using both an 'objective' measure and a subjective rating scale may be appropriate and the only way of truly capturing the phenomenon of interest.","Article","10.3109/09638281003775501","WOS:000278592600007","WoS"

At the same time it can be used as treatment option at all stages of MS. In order to accurately quantify the exact dose of treatment for exercise therapy with PA, reliable devices and measurements are needed to assess the PA of MS patients in daily life. Objective: To explore the usability of accelerometry in an exercise therapy setting and the association between disease status and physical activity as a biomarker. Method: In an exploratory study 19 MS patients performed a week measurement of PA, which was assessed with the tri-axial accelerometer actibelt(r) and the Baecke questionnaire. Exercise capacity VO2max was measured by ergospirometry. Collected accelerometry data were pre-processed by noise filtering and compared with MS relevant patient data: sex, age, height, weight, MS course, EDSS, VO2max, social status, work-, sport-and leisure-time index. Parameters extracted from the acceleration data were activity temperature (i.e. the mean daily PA), walking speed, number of steps, step length, active and exercise minutes, coherence length and adherence. Spearman correlation coefficients and multiple linear models together with a step-wise model selection procedure were used to assess the association between patient data and accelerometry parameters. Results: Data on 19 patients (17 female, 2 male; mean age 41.6±11.1y) were available for analysis. Clinical patient characteristics were EDSS range 1.5-6, MS course: 14 RRMS, 5 SPMS, mean VO2max 23.9 ± 5.9 ml/kg/min. 75% of patients wore the actibelt(r) > 10h per day on average (mean 12 ±5.9 h). Walking speed was significantly associated with age (-0.633, p = 0.004), VO2max (0.632, p = 0.005) and EDSS (-0.584, p = 0.011). The final multiple model for walking speed which was adjusted for all baseline variables included EDSS (-0.089, p = 0.001), sex (-0.107 m. ref. f., p = 0.039), social status (-0.015 homemaker, 0.138 retired, 0.143 unemployed ref. employed, p = 0.011), sport index (0.039, p = 0.102), and VO2max (0.010, p = 0.005). Conclusion: Patient adherence suggests a high usability and confirms results from earlier, independent studies. Meaningful parameters which show plausible interactions with patient data can be extracted from week measurements. The actibelt(r) motion capture and analysis platform may be used to analyse the impact of exercise therapy on novel, patient-oriented outcome measures (e.g. walking speed).","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458510383204","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13524585&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458510383204&atitle=Mobile+accelerometry+as+a+tool+to+measure+physical+activity+as+outcome+parameter+for+exercise+therapy+in+MS+patients%3A+A+feasibility+study&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=16&issue=10&spage=S65&epage=S66&aulast=Schimpl&aufirst=M.&auinit=M.&aufull=Schimpl+M.&coden=&isbn=&pages=S65-S66&date=2010&auinit1=M&auinitm=","Embase"

Physical activity is a potentially modifiable, behavioral correlate of anxiety and depression in the early stages of MS. Objective: The present study provides an initial examination of the associations between physical activity and anxiety and depression in early MS. We hypothesized that physical activity might be a correlate of anxiety and depression in early MS and that this association might be indirect and accounted for by disability. Methods: The sample included 96 individuals with a mean duration of MS of 3.0 years (SD = 1.5, range = 0.5-5 years). The participants wore an accelerometer for 7 days as an objective measure of physical activity and then completed the Patient Determined Disease Steps (PDDS) scale and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Results: Descriptive analysis indicated that 41% and 43% of the sample had elevated levels of anxiety and depression, respectively, based on HADS scores (i.e., score ≥8). Correlation analysis indicated that physical activity was significantly associated with depression (r = -0.25; ρ = -.23), but not anxiety (r = -0.05; ρ = -.02). Path analysis indicated that the association between physical activity and depression was entirely indirect by way of disability (path coefficient = -0.23). Conclusions: Such results suggest that physical activity could be an important health promoting behavior for reducing depression in the early stages of MS and this should be the focus of subsequent randomized controlled clinical trials. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Objectives: This study examined the associations among physical activity, neurological disability, and cardiorespiratory ftness in two studies of persons with MS. Methods: Study 1 included 25 women with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) who undertook an incremental exercise test for measuring peak oxygen consumption (VO(2)peak), wore an accelerometer during a 7-day period, and completed the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ).

The complexity of the MS population has offered challenges to the measurement of MS disease progression in therapeutic trials. The current standard clinical outcome measures are relapse rate, Expanded Disability Severity Scale (EDSS), and the MS Functional Composite (MSFC). These measures each have strengths and some weakness. Two additional measures, the six-minute walk and accelerometry, show promise in augmenting current measures. MS therapeutics is a quickly advancing field which requires sensitive clinical outcome measures that can detect small changes in disability that reliably reflect long-term changes in sustained disease progression in a complex population. A single clinical outcome measure of sustained disease progression may remain elusive.

Fifty persons with multiple sclerosis (Expanded Disability Status Scale, EDSS, 1.5-6.5) were tested on leg muscle strength as well as walking and balance capacity, and completed self-report indices on perceived physical functioning. Habitual walking performance, that is, the real amount of steps that is performed in the customary living environment, was registered by means of an ambulant accelerometer-based monitor during seven consecutive days. Mild (EDSS 1.5-4.0, n = 29) and moderate (EDSS 4.5-6.5, n = 21) multiple sclerosis subgroups were additionally distinguished as predictor variables and values were hypothesized to differ depending on multiple sclerosis severity and concomitant ambulatory function. Multiple regression analyses yielded a single most significant predictor for each (sub)group with other variables making no independent contribution to the variation in habitual walking performance. For the total study sample, this was the 6-Minute Walking Test (R(2) = 0.458, p < 0.01). In the mild multiple sclerosis subgroup, the 6-Minute Walking Test was again most predictive, yet to a modest degree (R(2) = 0. 187, p = 0.02). In the moderate multiple sclerosis subgroup, the 2-Minute Walking Test explained over half of the variance (R(2) = 0.532, p < 0.01). Habitual walking performance is best reflected by longer walking capacity tests. The extent to which it can be predicted based on clinical testing is larger in a multiple sclerosis patient sample with more severe walking disability.

Design: Cross-sectional comparison. Subjects: Eighteen adults with multiple sclerosis and 18 adults without multiple sclerosis. Methods: VO(2) was measured at rest and during treadmill walking at 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0 mph with open-circuit spirometry. The actual VO(2) was compared with that estimated by both the American College of Sports Medicine and the van der Walt and Wyndham equations. Results: The differences between the actual VO(2) and that estimated by both equations were significantly higher than zero across speeds for both groups (p < 0.001). The underestimation increased with increasing speed (p < 0.001) for both groups and was greater for participants with multiple sclerosis than those without multiple sclerosis (p < 0.011). The inaccurate prediction by the American College of Sports Medicine formula was associated with an underestimation of the net VO(2) per meter (p < 0.001), and this was higher for participants with multiple sclerosis (p < 0.007).

We examined total movement counts and three novel methods of processing accelerometer data (i.e. standard deviation, approximate entropy and detrended fluctuation analysis) for quantifying real-life walking impairment in this population. A total of 70 individuals with a definite diagnosis of multiple sclerosis completed a battery of patient-rated measures of walking impairment and then wore an ActiGraph accelerometer for 7 days. The data were analyzed using multivariate analysis of variance and bivariate correlation analysis. The results indicated that total daily movement counts and standard deviation of daily movement counts differed between groups of persons with mild, moderate, and severe self-reported disability status and who were independently ambulatory or ambulatory with assistance. Those two metrics for the accelerometer data further demonstrated strong correlations with patient-rated measures of walking impairment. By comparison, there were smaller and often non-significant differences in approximate entropy and detrended fluctuation analysis metrics for the accelerometer data as a function of disability and ambulatory status, and only moderate correlations with patient-rated measures of walking impairment. The results confirm that the metric of total daily movement counts correlates with level of disability, ambulatory status, and patient reports of walking impairment in persons with multiple sclerosis. We further demonstrate that variability, indexed by the standard deviation of daily movement counts, correlates with multiple sclerosis-related disability, ambulatory status, and self-reported walking impairment. Such results provide preliminary evidence that variability in accelerometer counts is not simply noise and may provide important information about multiple sclerosis-related walking impairment.© 2010 The Author(s).","Article","10.1177/1352458510373111","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13524585&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458510373111&atitle=Real-life+walking+impairment+in+multiple+sclerosis%3A+Preliminary+comparison+of+four+methods+for+processing+accelerometry+data&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=16&issue=7&spage=868&epage=877&aulast=Sosnoff&aufirst=Jacob+J.&auinit=J.J.&aufull=Sosnoff+J.J.&coden=MUSCF&isbn=&pages=868-877&date=2010&auinit1=J&auinitm=J","Embase"

Relevance: The impact of upper limb dysfunction is poorly documented in PwMS. However the upper limbs plays an important role in the accomplishment ofmany daily activities. More insights are needed regarding the use and functioning of the upper limbs in the daily living in PwMS, and related outcome measures. Participants: In this ongoing study 15PwMSwith unilateral or bilateral upper limb dysfunction due to muscle weakness are included so far. Methods: The clinical outcome measurements on different levels of the ICF were the Motricity Index (MI), Jamar, Brunnstrom Fugl Meyer (BFM), Action Research Arm test (ARAT) and the nine hole peg test (9HPT) as well as an adapted version of the Motor Activity Log (MAL). The motionloggers of AMI inc. (Ardsley, New York) were used to objectively measure the 'real life' use of the upper limb. They were attached for 1 week to the wrist of both hands. The output of the motionloggers is the Proportional Integration Measure (PIM). The PIM is a measure of activity level of motion. Analysis: Spearman rank order correlation coefficients were used to quantity the relationship between the motion loggers and the different outcome measurements. Multiple regression analyses with motion loggers as dependent and the clinical outcome measures as independent variables will be carried out when data of a larger sample are available. Results: The preliminary results in 15 persons indicate that, for the dominant hand, moderate to high correlations were found between the motionloggers (PIM) and the BFM (r = 0.633), MAL (r = 0.769), MI (r = 0.768) and Jamar (r = 0.803). No significant correlations were found with the ARAT and NHPT. For the non-dominant hand, all correlations were remarkably higher compared to the dominant hand with the highest correlation found with MAL (r = 0.818). Conclusions: For both hands, the highest correlations were found between the motionloggers and the measurements on function level: MI, Jamar and BFM. The preliminary results also suggest that theMAL, a subjective measurement of upper limb use during performing ADL is well correlated with the motionloggers, an objective measurement of real-life use of the upper limbs.

The evaluation of the effectiveness of an orthosis is generally based on subjective criteria, on functional scores or on motor performance tests [1-3]. Wearable inertial devices can be reliably used in these cases for outcome measurements with respect to the proposed treatment [4,5]. Material and methods A 62mm×36mm×16mm, Free4Act device, sampling frequency 50 Hz, was stuck at the L5 level, in 10 hemiplegic patients (5 with stroke and in 5 patients with Multiple Sclerosis). The equinus foot was corrected using an AFO. Subjects were asked to walk 20 meter distance at comfortable speed, and gait time-distance parameters were reconstructed by means of the device. Subjects performed three walking repetitions, with and without the orthosis. Data of patients were compared with those of normal subjects previously acquired and validated with a Vicon stereophotogrammetric system 612. Results Although many parameters showed improvement on an individual basis none of them resulted statistically significant when the entire sample of patients was analysed (Mann Whitney with exact method for small samples). (Table presented) Discussion These results show that the inertial device is sensitive to measure gait parameters providing a useful indicator of outcome in patients with AFO. Such measurements could be differently achieved only by means of traditional gait analysis, which however is expensive, is based on a few steps under conditions of walk constrained by the laboratory which does not reflect the environment in which the patient usually moves.","Conference Abstract","10.1016/J.GAITPOST.2010.10.081","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=09666362&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.gaitpost.2010.10.081&atitle=A+new+inertial+wireless+dispositive+for+gait+analysis%3A+Functional+outcome+measures+in+patients+with+AFO&stitle=Gait+Posture&title=Gait+and+Posture&volume=33&issue=&spage=S65&epage=SS66&aulast=Benedetti&aufirst=M.G.&auinit=M.G.&aufull=Benedetti+M.G.&coden=&isbn=&pages=S65-SS66&date=2011&auinit1=M&auinitm=G","Embase"

The sensors were placed on anatomical segments of the lower limb: foot, shank, thigh, and hip, and the motion data were then captured in conjunction with 3D ground reaction forces (GRFs). The method of relational matrix was applied to develop a rule-based system, an intelligent fuzzy computational algorithm. The rule-based system provides a feature matrix model representing the strength of association or interaction amongst the elements of the gait functions (limb-segments accelerations and GRFs) throughout the gait cycle. A comparison between the reference rule-based data and an input test data was evaluated using a fuzzy similarity algorithm. This system was tested and evaluated using two subject groups: 10 healthy subjects were recruited to establish the reference fuzzy rule-base, and 4 relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis subjects were used as an input test data; and the grade of similarity between them was evaluated.

Objective: To evaluate the relationship of gait parameters, and demographic and physical characteristics in healthy men and women. Design, Setting, and Participants: Recruitment of a subsample (n = 358) of male and female blood donors taking part in the Cambridge CardioResource study. Collection of demographic data, measurement of physical characteristics (height, weight and blood pressure) and assessment of 7-day, free-living activity parameters using accelerometry and a novel algorithm to measure walking speed. Participants were a median (interquartile range[IQR]) age of 49 (16) years; 45% women; and had a median (IQR) BMI of 26 (5.4). Main Outcome Measure: Walking speed. Results: In this study, the hypothesis that walking speed declines with age was generated using an initial 'open' dataset. This was subsequently validated in a separate 'closed' dataset that showed a decrease of walking speed of -0.0037 m/s per year. This is equivalent to a difference of 1.2 minutes, when walking a distance of 1 km aged 20 compared to 60 years. Associations between walking speed and other participant characteristics (i.e. gender, BMI and blood pressure) were non-significant. BMI was negatively correlated with the number of walking and running steps and longest non-stop distance. Conclusion: This is the first study using accelerometry which shows an association between walking speed and age in free-living, healthy individuals. Absolute values of gait speed are comparable to published normal ranges in clinical settings.

In a clinical setting, walking speed is typically measured by means of walking tests using different protocols. However, walking speed obtained in this way is unlikely to be representative of the conditions in a free-living environment. Recently, mobile accelerometry has opened up the possibility to extract walking speed from long-time observations in free-living individuals, but the validity of these measurements needs to be determined. In this investigation, we have developed algorithms for walking speed prediction based on 3D accelerometry data (actibelt®) and created a framework using a standardized data set with gold standard annotations to facilitate the validation and comparison of these algorithms. For this purpose 17 healthy subjects operated a newly developed mobile gold standard while walking/running on an indoor track. Subsequently, the validity of 12 candidate algorithms for walking speed prediction ranging from well-known simple approaches like combining step length with frequency to more sophisticated algorithms such as linear and non-linear models was assessed using statistical measures. As a result, a novel algorithm employing support vector regression was found to perform best with a concordance correlation coefficient of 0.93 (95%CI 0.92-0.94) and a coverage probability CP1 of 0.46 (95%CI 0.12-0.70) for a deviation of 0.1 m/s (CP2 0.78, CP3 0.94) when compared to the mobile gold standard while walking indoors. A smaller outdoor experiment confirmed those results with even better coverage probability. We conclude that walking speed thus obtained has the potential to help establish walking speed in free-living environments as a patient-oriented outcome measure. © 2011 Schimpl et al.","Article","10.1371/JOURNAL.PONE.0023080","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=19326203&id=doi:10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0023080&atitle=Development+and+validation+of+a+new+method+to+measure+walking+speed+in+free-living+environments+using+the+actibelt%C2%AE+platform&stitle=PLoS+ONE&title=PLoS+ONE&volume=6&issue=8&spage=&epage=&aulast=Schimpl&aufirst=Michaela&auinit=M.&aufull=Schimpl+M.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2011&auinit1=M&auinitm=","Embase"

To characterise the use of tilt-in-space systems and to form recommendations for tilt prescription and training based upon its use. Method. Wheelchair occupancy and seat position of 45 full-time power wheelchair users were monitored for 1-2 weeks using an accelerometer, occupancy switch and data logger. Demographics, pressure ulcer history, functional and physical presentations of their disability, and sensation were also documented. Results. Participants spent 12.1 h in their wheelchairs daily, with a median typical position of 8° (0°-47°). The median participant tilted every 27 min (0.1-16.6 tilts per occupancy hour). Pressure-relieving tilts (i.e. a tilt ≥ 30° for ≥ 1 min) were performed, on average, once every 10 h (0-2.2/h). Participants spent 19% of their seated time tilted past 15°. Seventeen participants utilised the tilt feature frequently and spent >20% of the time in multiple positions. The remaining participants sat in a single tilt range for >80% of the time. Conclusions.

Advances in technology have resulted in an increased number of motion sensors such as pedometers and accelerometers that are worn on the body and that measure bodily movement. Accelerometers are becoming less expensive and more user-friendly, but there is limited evidence regarding the accuracy of measurement in persons with MS. Objective: The present study examined the accuracy of an ActiGraph accelerometer for measuring steps taken during controlled conditions in persons with MS compared with a sample of individuals without MS. Methods: The participants were 24 adults with mild MS and 24 adults without MS who undertook three 6-minute periods of walking at 54, 80, and 107 m·min(-1) on a motor-driven treadmill. We measured steps taken through observation and an ActiGraph model 7164 accelerometer worn around the waist above the right hip. Results: The accelerometer accurately measured steps during moderate (80 m·min(-1)) and fast (107 m·min(-1)) walking in both persons with MS and control subjects. There was a small degree of underestimation of step counts (≈4% error) for the accelerometer during slower walking (54 m·min(-1)) in both persons with MS and control subjects.

Thirty physically active women (mean +/- SD; 21.7 +/- 1.67 years) were randomized in three groups. The first group performed on the platform with 15, 45 and 90 degrees knee flexions, the second group with 45, 90, 15 degrees, and the third group with 90, 15, 45 degrees. The WBV frequency was 12.6 Hz. The acceleration was recorded by a tri-axial accelerometer (Biopac) attached on the skin at L3 level and the electromyography (EMG) was recorded by surface active electrodes (Biopac) on the extensors and flexors of the knee and lower trunk. The lateral acceleration was 3 times greater (p < 0.05) at the vertical line in 3 angles of flexion, and the vertical line was 2 times greater (p < 0.05). Maximum accelerations: lateral (11-13 g) and vertical line (6-7 g) had increased when reducing the knee-flexion angles. In conclusion, WBV using the Galileo platform transmits more lateral neuromuscular and mechanical stimuli than vertical stimuli. A smaller degree of knee flexion transmits a greater mechanical stimulus, and a higher flexion of the knees implies an increase of muscular activity in the vastus internus muscle. These findings open the possibility of different applications.","Article","10.5604/959286","WOS:000295564900009","WoS"

Often, though, voluntary activation of an emergency call (by pressing a help button, or activating any kind of AT communication device) can be quite demanding for people with debilitating diseases or severe motion impairments (besides, of course, depending on patient's consciousness). Modern ICTs can provide much help, enabling automatic recognition of help needs and management of emergency calls. Although very different in nature, this task has many technical similarities with environmental safety and security control carried out by an Ambient-Assisted Living system, which, in turn, can be also quite useful in allowing bedridden patients to control the home environment. Hence, embedding health-monitoring features within a general-purpose AAL framework may result in a more flexible, reliable and cost-effective solution. This work aims at describing design and implementation of such a solution in a live context: the CARDEA AAL system was deployed at 'Casa Scarzara', a sheltered house for people with multiple sclerosis in Parma, embedding wireless sensors for vital-sign monitoring. Main Content A wireless wearable sensor has been used, which allows for acquiring 3 physiological parameters (2-channel ECG, temperature, and breathing). The sensor is worn at patient's chest, and wirelessly communicates with a PC (base-station), through a Bluetooth connection. The base-station then processes the incoming data stream, extracting the hearth and breathing rates; if such rates (or body temperature) exceed given ranges, the processor issue a request to CARDEA, through a standard LAN connection. From this phase on, CARDEA manages the emergency call, warning a human attendant, by means of visual or acoustic signals, or activating a local pager. If no one takes care of the alert within a few minutes, emergency phone calls and SMS are generated automatically by the CARDEA system. Results Before deployment, the system has undergone extensive testing at TAU labs, with positive results. Field-testing at 'Casa Scarzara' is starting (February 2011). We expect the proposed solution can help to increase protection of a bedridden person, by providing continuous local and possibly remote supervision.","Proceedings Paper","10.3233/978-1-60750-814-4-81","WOS:000393465400011","WoS"

Regular walking assessments should be a component of patient management and require instruments that are appropriate from the clinician's and the patient's perspectives. This article reviews frequently used instruments to assess walking in patients with MS, with emphasis on their validity, reliability, and practicality in the clinical setting. Relevant articles were identified based on PubMed searches using the following terms: """"multiple sclerosis AND (walking OR gait OR mobility OR physical activity) AND (disability evaluation)""""; references of relevant articles were also searched. Although many clinician- and patient-driven instruments are available, not all have been validated in MS, and some are not sensitive enough to detect small but clinically important changes. Choosing among these depends on what needs to be measured, psychometric properties, the clinical relevance of results, and practicality with respect to space, time, and patient burden. Of the instruments available, the clinician-observed Timed 25-Foot Walk and patient self-report 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale have properties that make them suitable for routine evaluation of walking performance. The Dynamic Gait Index and the Timed Up and Go test involve other aspects of mobility, including balance. Tests of endurance, such as the 2- or 6-Minute Walk, may provide information on motor fatigue not captured by other tests. Quantitative measurement of gait kinetics and kinematics, and recordings of mobility in the patient's environment via accelerometry or Global Positioning System odometry, are currently not routinely used in the clinical setting.","Journal Article","10.7224/1537-2073-13.1.4",NA,"PubMed"

By measuring the daily activity of MS patients, accelerometers could help us to observe the course of the disease more objectively. With the measured data, indicators like active speed can be gained to objectify the patient's disease status at home. In this study over a period of 2 years, patients with MS wore accelerometers, embedded in the buckle of a belt. The results of the study show that patients were willing to wear the accelerometer devices and that the obtained data reveal differences between healthy people and patients with MS.

Am J Phys Med Rehabil 2011;90:372-379. Objective: There is currently no published evidence from longitudinal or intervention studies of an association between lifestyle physical activity and walking impairment in persons with multiple sclerosis. This panel study tested the hypothesis that a change in lifestyle physical activity would be inversely associated with change in walking impairment over a 6-mo period in persons with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Design: Participants with a confirmed diagnosis of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis completed a battery of measures at baseline (n = 269) and at 6-mo follow-up (n = 263) in the absence of an intervention. The data were analyzed using linear panel analysis and covariance modeling in Mplus 3.0. Results: The panel model fit the data (chi(2) = 25.23; df = 12; P = 0.01; standardized root-mean-squared residual, 0.04; comparative fit index, 0.98) and, as expected, identified the direct effects between baseline physical activity and walking impairment (path coefficient, -0.31) and follow-up physical activity and walking impairment (path coefficient, -0.16). The second path coefficient indicated that a standard deviation unit change of 1 in physical activity was associated with a standard deviation unit residual change of 0.16 in walking impairment. Conclusions: The finding supports the possible importance of targeting free-living physical activity as a behavioral approach for forestalling walking impairments in adults with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.","Article","10.1097/PHM.0B013E31820F95E1","WOS:000289280900004","WoS"

Intention tremor is a complex movement disorder that worsens during goal directed movements and can therefore be extremely disabling. Multiple inertial measurement unit devices were used to measure the upper limb of subjects with multiple sclerosis and intention tremor during standard clinical finger-to-nose tests and reach-retrieve tasks, which were designed to mimic activities of daily living. Analyses allowed information on tremor characteristics to be ascertained during these movements. The equipment and software provide a useful tool for clinical assessment of tremor, displaying a variety of relevant information at differing levels of detail, obtainable at several points over the torso, shoulder, upper arm, lower arm and hand. Examples of this data are discussed. The system allows tremor assessment in more detail than is possible with clinical tests that rely on visual assessments, and provides a tool that can accurately assess the benefits of future tremor reduction devices, or other interventions.","Proceedings Paper",NA,"WOS:000308513400037","WoS"

A remarkable number of self-report scales or clinical performance-based measures attempt to quantify various aspects of fatigue, but there is no accepted standard. We used mobile accelerometry to find novel patient-oriented outcome parameters that are di-rectly related to certain aspects of fatigue: the ability to walk long distances and the corre-sponding walking speed within these long distances in free-living conditions. Methods: 47 MS patients recorded a 7-day measurement with the actibelt, a tri-axial accelerometer (100Hz, 512MB) integrated in a belt buckle. Two novel parameters were extracted from accelerometry data: step ratio (SR) and velocity ratio (VR). SR is defined as the proportion of steps within sequences of more than a certain number of steps in a row (i.e. 50, 100) in rela-tion to the total number of steps; velocity ratio (VR) is the mean walking speed within these high-order step sequences. Subsequently, SR and VR were compared to relevant patient data: expanded disability status scale (EDSS), self-reported walking distance limit (WDL), maxi-mum oxygen uptake (VO2max) and scores from a fatigue-specific questionnaire (WEIMuS). Spearman rank correlation coefficients were used to assess the correlation between acceler-ometry and patient data. Results: Data on 47 patients (81% female, age 42±10 years, EDSS 3.1±0.9, WDL 7579±8389 m, VO2max 24.8±8.1 ml/kg/ min) were available for analysis. Both SR50 and SR100 showed a positive correlation with WDL (0.60 and 0.59, p=0.002 and 0.003) and VO2max (0.37 and 0.31, p=0.010 and 0.036). VR50 and VR100 showed a negative correlation with EDSS (-0.56 and -0.53, p < 0.001 for both) and a positive correlation with WDL (0.74 and 0.68, p< 0.001 for both) and VO2max (0.38 and 0.44, p=0.009 and 0.002). WEIMuS scores were not signifi-cantly associated to any of the accelerometry or patient variables. Discussion/Conclusion: SR and VR are promising candidate variables to objectively capture important aspects of fa-tigue that are not reflected well by the WEIMuS questionnaire score. Comparison with clini-cal measures of endurance capacity and patient-reported limitations of walking indicate a high level of construct and ecological validity. Mobile accelerometry has the potential to generate outcomes that may be used as objective patient-oriented markers for important facets of fatigue in MS.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458511422300","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13524585&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458511422300&atitle=Mobile+accelerometry+as+a+tool+to+objectively+assess+fatigue+in+MS+patients&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=17&issue=10&spage=S93&epage=&aulast=Schimpl&aufirst=M.&auinit=M.&aufull=Schimpl+M.&coden=&isbn=&pages=S93-&date=2011&auinit1=M&auinitm=","Embase"

Methods: The sample included 561 persons with MS who completed demographic, cardiovascular comorbidity, disability status, and physical activity self-report assessments, and then wore an accelerometer for 7 days. The data were analyzed using bivariate correlation and multiple linear regression analyses. Results: Bivariate correlation analysis indicated that there were statistically significant, inverse associations between the number of self-reported cardiovascular comorbidities and objectively measured (r = -0.192, p = 0.0001) and self-reported (r = -0.151, p = 0.0001) physical activity.

Methods: 30 MS patients from an outpatient clinic in Hamburg (Germany) were included in this study. Clinical and subjective disease status was assessed using EDSS and a quality of life questionnaire (HALEMS 10.0). Physical activity was measured on 7 consecutive days using a 3-dimensional accelerometer (100Hz sampling frequency), the actibelt®. Activity temperature (AT), activity level, walking speed and number of steps, as well as proportion of steps within sequences of more than 50/100 steps (SR50/100) are included in the set of parameters extracted form the raw signal of the device. Physical activity parameters were compared among EDSS levels and HALEMS using nonparametric statistics and Spearman rang correlation. Results: The mean age of the patients was 44.4 (sd 10.9) years, 67.7% were female, mean EDSS score was 3.6 (sd 1.6), mean disease duration 10.7 (sd 7.2) years, 15 patients have RRMS, 9 SPMS and 5 PPMS. 50% of the patients were able to complete a 500m walk in the clinic. All extracted actibelt® parameters correlate significantly with disability subgroups (EDSS ≤2.5, 3-4.5, 5-6.5). Patients with EDSS 5-6.5 were considerably more inactive compared to the other subgroups. A higher EDSS score was associated with lower walking speed (overall speed: r=-0.539 (p=0.003); speed in sequences with more than 50/100 steps: r=-0.533 (p=0.003) / r=-0.509 (p=0.006)), distance (r=-0.403 (p=0.033)), and number of steps / h (r=-0.417 (p=0.027)). The mean patient (subjective) based outcome, HALEMS mobility sub-score, was 2.45(1.02) [range: 1-5] and significantly correlated to walking speed parameters (overall speed: r=-0.413 (p=0.036); speed in sequences with more than 50/100 steps: r=-0.423 (p=0.031) / r=-0.403 (p=0.041)). Patients that were able to complete a 500 walking test were more active in daily life (mean number of steps: 6448 vs. 4998, AT: 6.27 vs. 5.79, SR50: 73.9% vs. 60.3%, SR100: 55.9% vs. 42.0% (all p<0.001)). Conclusion: actibelt® activity parameters are significantly associated with EDSS. Subjective mobility status is associated with walking speed. Future studies should clarify the additional value of actibelt® to differentiate differing activity levels on similar EDSS levels in addition to correlates with patient-reported measures.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458511422292","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13524585&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458511422292&atitle=Physical+activity+in+multiple+sclerosis%3A+Association+of+3D-accelerometry+data+with+subjective+and+rater-based+disease+status&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=17&issue=10&spage=S13&epage=S14&aulast=Stellmann&aufirst=J.-P.&auinit=J.-P.&aufull=Stellmann+J.-P.&coden=&isbn=&pages=S13-S14&date=2011&auinit1=J&auinitm=-P","Embase"

Material/Methods: The study included 49 consecutive patients with relapsing-remitting MS who received Solu-Medrol 1000 mg/day over 3 days for relapse with difficulties in walking. The following walking-based measures were administered before and a month after IVMP: the Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale-12 (MSWS-12), the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), the 2-minute timed walk (2-minTW), the 25-foot walk test (25FWT), the Six Spot Step Test (SSST). All patients had worn the step activity monitor accelerometer (SAM) 1 week prior to IVMP was applied and wore it again the fourth week upon the corticosteroid therapy was completed. The SAM analysis utilized the average daily step count and data regarding frequency and intensity of walking over a continuous time interval. We examined: (1) the impact of IVMP on the recovery of walking ability; (2) the responsiveness of each walking-based measure; (3) the relative responsiveness of competing walking-based measures; and (4) the impact of different walking-based measures responsiveness on clinical trials. Results: All walking-based measures showed significant improvement of walking ability 1 month after the IVMP. The most responsive were MSWS-12 and EDSS. Different responsiveness implied a greater than 6-fold impact on sample size estimates. Conclusions: All applied walking-based measures showed significant improvement of walking ability 1 month after the IVMP.

Relevance: There have been advancements in rehabilitation robotics including an exoskeleton-based robot for gait rehabilitation, but effectiveness and optimal utilization are unclear for clinicians. This study would be useful to develop an optimal strategy for robotic utilization in gait rehabilitation. Description: The literature review for Randomized Control Trial (RCT) to identify the effectiveness of robotics for gait rehabilitation was conducted from two English databases, PEDro (the Physiotherapy Evidence database). Another review was completed in two major Japanese databases, Ichushi and Medical Online. Also handsearch for Japanese studies were conducted through relevant conferences, and checked references. The key words, “gait” “robotics” “robot”, were used in both searches, and the published term of searched literature was up to March 2010. Evaluation: The author of this study conducted all literature reviews. The English reviews of RCT studies identified that robotics, Lokomat® and Rutgers Ankle Rehabilitation System, were utilized for patients with sub acute or chronic stroke, multiple sclerosis, or incomplete spinal cord injury. Most studies did not have similar protocol for selection of patients, outcome measures, and treatments except for two studies which had same investigators. Some RCTs with Lokomat® showed improvements of gait function and muscle strength, but overall effectiveness was inconclusive among all studies. The Japanese reviews did not reveal any RCT, but robotic utilization in gait rehabilitation included ROBOT SUIT HAL® (Hybrid Assistive Limb®), WPAL (Wearable Power-Assist Locomotor), and BMRS (Bio-Responsive Motion System), were found. These case studies were applied for patients with neurological problems including stroke, spinal cord injuries, and Guillain-Barre syndrome. Conclusions: The review of previous RCT studies indicated there were limited number of studies, and very few consistent methods and expected outcomes among all studies. Therefore, the utilization of exoskeleton-based robots for gait rehabilitation was still under development, and more RCT studies with a standardized protocol should be necessary. Implications: The application of the exoskeleton-based robots might have potential benefits in neurorehabilitation. Therefore, there might be promising opportunities to utilize these technologies for gait rehabilitation among patients with various neurological conditions. Future studies including both detailed case and RCT studies should be conducted by physical therapists who are interested in exploring the better utilization of robotic technologies for gait rehabilitation.","Conference Abstract","10.1016/J.PHYSIO.2011.04.003","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=00319406&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.physio.2011.04.003&atitle=The+effectiveness+of+robotics+in+gait+rehabilitation+through+english+and+Japanese+literature+reviews&stitle=Physiotherapy&title=Physiotherapy+%28United+Kingdom%29&volume=97&issue=&spage=eS1508&epage=eS1509&aulast=Hasegawa&aufirst=M.&auinit=M.&aufull=Hasegawa+M.&coden=&isbn=&pages=eS1508-eS1509&date=2011&auinit1=M&auinitm=","Embase"

This study examined the effects of gait disability on 1) the association between rates of energy expenditure and accelerometer output in overground walking and 2) the calibration of accelerometer output for quantifying time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in people with MS. The sample consisted of 24 individuals with MS, of whom 10 reported gait disability based on Patient-Determined Disease Steps (PDDS) scores. The participants undertook three 6-minute periods of overground walking while wearing an accelerometer and a portable metabolic unit (K4b2, Cosmed, Rome, Italy). In the first period of walking, the participants walked at a self-selected, comfortable speed. In the two subsequent walking periods, participants walked at speeds above and below (±0.5 mph) the comfortable walking speed, respectively. Strong linear relationships were observed between rates of accelerometer activity counts and energy expenditure during walking in the overall sample (R(2) = 0.90) and subsamples with (R(2) = 0.88) and without gait disability (R(2) = 0.91). The slope of the relationship was significantly steeper in the subsample with gait disability (β= 0.0049) than in the subsample without gait disability (β= 0.0026). The difference in slopes resulted in a significantly lower cut-point for MVPA (1886 vs. 2717 counts/min) in those with gait disability. These findings provide a metabolic cut-point for quantifying time spent in MVPA in people with MS, both with and without gait disability.","Journal Article","10.7224/1537-2073-13.4.170",NA,"PubMed"

Inexpensive, unobtrusive wireless sensors, including accelerometers, gyroscopes, and pressure-sensitive textiles, combined with Internet-based communications and machine-learning algorithms trained to recognize upper- and lower-extremity movements, have begun to fulfill this need. Continuous data from ankle triaxial accelerometers, for example, can be transmitted from the home and community via WiFi or a smartphone to a remote data analysis server. Reports can include the walking speed and duration of every bout of ambulation, spatiotemporal symmetries between the legs, and the type, duration, and energy used during exercise. For daily care, this readily accessible flow of real-world information allows clinicians to monitor the amount and quality of exercise for risk factor management and compliance in the practice of skills. Feedback may motivate better self-management as well as serve home-based rehabilitation efforts. Monitoring patients with chronic diseases and after hospitalization or the start of new medications for a decline in daily activity may help detect medical complications before rehospitalization becomes necessary. For clinical trials, repeated laboratory-quality assessments of key activities in the community, rather than by clinic testing, self-report, and ordinal scales, may reduce the cost and burden of travel, improve recruitment and retention, and capture more reliable, valid, and responsive ratio-scaled outcome measures that are not mere surrogates for changes in daily impairment, disability, and functioning. © 2011 American Society of Neurorehabilitation.","Article","10.1177/1545968311425908","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=15459683&id=doi:10.1177%2F1545968311425908&atitle=The+promise+of+mHealth%3A+Daily+activity+monitoring+and+outcome+assessments+by+wearable+sensors&stitle=Neurorehabil.+Neural+Repair&title=Neurorehabilitation+and+Neural+Repair&volume=25&issue=9&spage=788&epage=798&aulast=Dobkin&aufirst=Bruce+H.&auinit=B.H.&aufull=Dobkin+B.H.&coden=JNRHF&isbn=&pages=788-798&date=2011&auinit1=B&auinitm=H","Embase"

Methods: Subjects wore an accelerometer (ActiGraph GT1M, Pensacola, FL) from 8am to 9pm for seven consecutive days. Activity counts recorded during this period were analyzed in one minute epochs and categorized into one of four PA levels: Light ≤ 1952 counts (< 2.99 metabolic equivalents (METS)), moderate 1953-5724 counts (3.0-5.99 METS), hard 5725-9498 counts (6.0-8.99 METS), and very hard > 9498 counts (> 9.0 METS). Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) was measured by a single treating neurologist. Results: Using a cross-sectional design, 11 females and 4 males (aged 48.8 ± 3.5, 40.5 ± 2.6 years) participated in this study (Kurtzke EDSS range of 0.5-6.5, mean = 2.6). All participants wore the accelerometer as instructed without difficulties. Appropriate data were retrieved from the devices for the predetermined monitoring period. There were significant negative correlations for minutes spent in PA and EDSS measures on the week days (r = -.61), weekend (r = -.64), and the full week (r = -.61), as well as for number of steps taken on week days (r = -.56), weekend (r = -.80) and on full week average, (r = -.68). A significant positive correlation was evident for minutes spent in light PA (according to METS) and EDSS (r = .69). However, for minutes spent in moderate and heavy PA and EDSS, significant negative correlations were found (r = -.56) and (r = -.53) respectively.No significance was found in minutes spent in very hard PA and EDSS (r = -.34). Conclusion: This study documents that accelerometers can be used to objectively quantify PA during normal daily routines in ambulatory MS individuals of different disability levels. This cohort demonstrated that the amount of PA is inversely proportional to the degree of physical disability, and that more PA was performed during weekends. The data reveal the amount and intensity of PA performed in real life circumstances and may be of use to the clinicians in correctly evaluating these patients.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458511422301","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13524585&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458511422301&atitle=Use+of+accelerometers+to+measure+real-life+physical+activity+in+ambulatory+MS+individuals+of+different+disability+levels&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=17&issue=10&spage=S479&epage=&aulast=Fjeldstad&aufirst=C.&auinit=C.&aufull=Fjeldstad+C.&coden=&isbn=&pages=S479-&date=2011&auinit1=C&auinitm=","Embase"

Relevance: Research has found that PwMS are significantly less physically active than healthy individuals (Motl et al., 2005). The majority of physical activity (PA) research has utilised subjective measurement tools which have notable associated limitations. Accelerometry based activity monitors are thought to provide the optimal objective PA measurement tool. However, no research to date has examined the criterion validity of any such device in PwMS. Participants: 30 subjects with MS and 15 healthy control subjects were recruited through the MS Society and via campus-wide email. Subjects with MS mobilised either independently or with the assistance of one stick (MSA) or with bilateral aids or a walking frame (MSB). Subjects were excluded if they were currently experiencing a worsening of symptoms due to a relapse. Methods: The Oxycon Mobile indirect calorimetry unit was the criterion method of measuring energy expenditure with the proprietary algorithms used to estimate steps and METs. Subjects were fitted with the AP on the mid-thigh, the SWA over the triceps and a facemask attached to the Oxycon Mobile unit. Subjects performed nine ADL activities as follows: dressing, walking, watching television, washing dishes, reading, stair climbing, writing/typing, dusting and folding laundry. Each activity lasted 10 minutes with the exception of stair-climbing which was 5 minute duration. The entire procedure was video recorded and steps taken were manually counted (criterion method). Analysis: Intra-class correlation coefficients and Bland and Altman analysis was used to determine the level of agreement between methods. The percentage error between methods was also calculated. Results: The SWA demonstrated a smaller percentage error (range 0.94% to -29.39%) across groups for step count than the AP (range -31.93% to -34.5%). The mean difference from manual step count for the SWA was 20 steps for the control group, 397 steps for MSA and 320 steps for MSB, as against 695 steps for the control group, 545 steps and 376 steps for the MSA and MSB groups respectively with the AP. The SWA had ICC's of 0.5-0.63 compared to 0.1-0.16 for the AP for METs and a notably smaller mean difference also. Conclusions: The SWA is better than the ActivPAL for measuring both steps and energy expenditure during combined upper and lower limbADL's when using the proprietary algorithms. The validity of the SWA for step count is negatively affected by gait impairment. The AP is a poor estimate of energy expenditure in PwMS. Implications: Future PA research in MS should use the SWA as these results suggest it is a valid estimate of steps and energy expenditure in PwMS. Future research should incorporate PA as an outcome measure in intervention studies examining the effects of exercise interventions in MS.","Conference Abstract","10.1016/J.PHYSIO.2011.04.002","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=00319406&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.physio.2011.04.002&atitle=Validity+of+the+sensewear+armband+and+activpal+activity+monitors+in+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Physiotherapy&title=Physiotherapy+%28United+Kingdom%29&volume=97&issue=&spage=eS235&epage=eS236&aulast=O%27Dwyer&aufirst=C.&auinit=C.&aufull=O%27Dwyer+C.&coden=&isbn=&pages=eS235-eS236&date=2011&auinit1=C&auinitm=","Embase"

Self-report questionnaires rely on the participant's cognitive function and reporting accuracy, while the association between clinical timed walk tests and community ambulation may not be strong. Progress toward the identification of an appropriate clinical tool to measure strides in PD and MS populations is hampered by the lack of meaningful research and reference standards in this area. Purpose: The objective of the present study was to explore the validity of the StepWatch Step Activity Monitor (SAM) in assessing stride count in persons with PD or MS. The SAM is a 2-dimensional accelerometer that counts strides and is calibrated for individual participants. Methods: A convenience sample of 20 participants completed a health history interview. Participants ambulated approximately 15 m while wearing the SAM to establish appropriate baseline calibrations, matching their stride with the device settings. Next, participants took 3 passes over the GaitMat II (GM II) while wearing the SAM. Strides counted by the GM were compared with the strides counted by the SAM. Results: The Pearson correlation coefficients (r) for MS and PD, respectively, were 0.99 and 1.0. Conclusions: Our investigation presents preliminary data that shows the concurrent validity of the SAM when compared with the gold standard GM. The SAM appears to be a valid tool for use in persons with PD and MS. The validity was apparent in a population of widely varying impairment levels.

Activity monitoring is potentially useful to monitor the impact of MS on physical functioning. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to explore the utility of the Actiwatch® activity monitor as a potential marker of disability in patients with MS. Methods: 29 patients with MS were given an Actiwatch® activity monitor to wear on their wrist and ankle continuously for a 7-day period. Data regarding the patients' total activity was collected and correlated with four validated measures of disease activity: the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), the MS Walking Scale 12 (MSWS-12) and two measures from the MS functional composite (MSFC): the Timed 25-foot Walk and the 9-hole Peg Test (9HPT). Results: Activity counts at the wrist and ankle both correlated with scores on the EDSS (wrist: r=0.51, p=0.006; ankle: r=0.63, p<0.0001) and MSWS-12 (wrist: r=0.53, p=0.003; ankle: r=0.59, p=0.001). Activity counts at the ankle correlate strongly with scores from the Timed 25-foot Walk (r=0.63, p<0.001), indicating that the device provides information about disease severity and walking mobility. In contrast, wrist activity did not correlate with the subjects' ability to perform the 9HPT (dominant hand, r=0.43; non-dominant hand, r=0.24, p=n.s), indicating the wrist activity does not provide information about manual dexterity. Conclusions: Our study indicates that the Actiwatch® provides valid data relating to specific aspects of disability in patients with MS.

Moreover, 4-AP alleviates cerebellar gait disorders by reducing the magnitude of gait variability. Here, we report on a novel effect of 4-AP that efficiently reduced cerebellar tremor in a patient with multiple sclerosis. A 44 years old woman with a progredient form of MS was treated with 5mg of 4-AP t.i.d. The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) was 6.5 with the leading symptoms of gait disturbance and cerebellar intention and holding tremor. Gait performance and tremor were measured using a pressure-sensitive carpet system (GaitRite®) and a surface EMG with 3D 1g-accelerometer (Noraxon®). Under treatment with 4-AP gait velocity increased from 0.35 m/s to 0.84 m/s 62h after initial treatment. Temporal gait variability decreased from 8.4% to 3.1% coefficient of variation. Root mean square (RMS) of acceleration decreased under 4-AP from 10.89 m/s2 to 2.23 m/s2 (left hand) and 4.23 m/s2 to 0.90 m/s2 (right hand). The patient reported a reduction of subjective daily impairment from 8 to 4 on a Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Here, we describe for the first time a patient with MS whose cerebellar tremor substantially decreased under the treatment with 4-AP. In an animal model, 4-AP was shown to reduce the excitability of neurons in ponto-cerebellar circles, which were attributed to generate tremor in mice. This might explain the positive effect of 4-AP on cerebellar tremor in our patient. The current case report gives first evidence, for the integration of tremor as an relevant parameter in future trials on 4-AP and its sustained release form Dalfampridine® in the symptomatic treatment of MS patients.","Conference Abstract","10.1055/S-0032-1301444","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14340275&id=doi:10.1055%2Fs-0032-1301444&atitle=4-aminopyridine+improves+cerebellar+tremor+in+a+patient+with+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Klin.+Neurophysiol.&title=Klinische+Neurophysiologie&volume=43&issue=1&spage=&epage=&aulast=W%C3%BChr&aufirst=M.&auinit=M.&aufull=W%C3%BChr+M.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2012&auinit1=M&auinitm=","Embase"

It can continuously measure electrocardiogram, body-skin temperature, electromyogram and motions of feet. The goal of this study is to test the ability of distinguishing fatigued MS patients from healthy subjects by the use of FAMOS. This paper presents the realization of the measurement system including the design of both hardware and dedicated signal processing algorithms. Twenty-six participants including 17 MS patients with fatigue and 9 sex- and age-matched healthy controls were included in the study for continuous 24h monitoring. The preliminary results show significant differences between fatigued MS patients and healthy controls. In conclusion, the FAMOS enables continuous data acquisition and estimation of multiple physiological and functional parameters. It provides a new, flexible and objective approach to study fatigue in MS, which can distinguish between fatigued MS patients and healthy controls. The usability and reliability of the FAMOS should however be further improved and validated through larger clinical trials. © 2012 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.","Article","10.1088/0967-3334/33/12/2033","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=09673334&id=doi:10.1088%2F0967-3334%2F33%2F12%2F2033&atitle=A+wireless+body+measurement+system+to+study+fatigue+in+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Physiol.+Meas.&title=Physiological+Measurement&volume=33&issue=12&spage=2033&epage=2048&aulast=Yu&aufirst=Fei&auinit=F.&aufull=Yu+F.&coden=PMEAE&isbn=&pages=2033-2048&date=2012&auinit1=F&auinitm=","Embase"

This study examined the association between rates of activity counts and energy expenditure during walking by using two models of accelerometers and generated cut-points representing moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in persons with MS. Participants were 43 persons with MS and 43 controls who undertook 5 min of seated rest and up to five 6 min periods of walking at five different speeds on a treadmill. While walking, participants wore two models of accelerometers and a mouthpiece in-line with an open-circuit spirometry system for measuring energy expenditure (rate of oxygen consumption). Strong linear associations were found between accelerometer activity counts and energy expenditure, and the magnitude did not differ between MS and controls for both accelerometer models. The mean slopes of the linear relationships were steeper in persons with MS than controls and resulted in distinct cut-points for MVPA based on accelerometer counts for persons with MS and controls. The strong linear relationship between activity counts and energy expenditure and cut-points for quantifying time spent in MVPA should allow for better understanding of physical activity and examination of its predictors and consequences when using accelerometers in MS.","Article","10.1682/JRRD.2011.03.0063","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=07487711&id=doi:10.1682%2FJRRD.2011.03.0063&atitle=Accelerometer+output+and+its+association+with+energy+expenditure+in+persons+with+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=J.+Rehabil.+Res.+Dev.&title=Journal+of+Rehabilitation+Research+and+Development&volume=49&issue=3&spage=467&epage=476&aulast=Sandroff&aufirst=Brian+M.&auinit=B.M.&aufull=Sandroff+B.M.&coden=JRRDD&isbn=&pages=467-476&date=2012&auinit1=B&auinitm=M","Embase"

We compared associations among accelerometer output, walking mobility, and physical activity between persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) and controls without a neurological disorder. Sixty-six persons (33 MS, 33 matched controls) completed a battery of questionnaires, performed the six-minute walk (6MW) and timed-up-and-go (TUG), and wore an accelerometer for a 7-day period. After this period, participants completed the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ) and International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ).

It provides new insights to help understand various human movement patterns corresponding to different gait pathology. Current limitations of gait analysis are variability and lack of reproducibility of gait measurements, in addition to the time and expense of gait studies. Therefore, this work aims to develop an automated gait assessment tool to manipulate the massive gait data in 3D (kinematic, kinetic, and electromyography [EMG]) and provide an objective and quantitative assessment of gait disorders. Method: An intelligent system is proposed for the analysis of gait data based on the methods of multi-sensors fusion and fuzzy granulation. Two subject groups, healthy able-bodied subjects and relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) subjects, are recruited in this study for testing and evaluating the proposed method. For normal walking, the data acquisition process involves ground reaction forces (GRFs) in 3D using an instrumented treadmill, surface EMG for muscles activity, and 3D kinematic data using wearable inertial sensors. Fuzzy information granules were constructed to represent the gait data for both healthy subjects and MS patients. The degree of similarity of fuzzy granules is used to provide a quantitative comparison between the reference granules of able-bodied subjects and the input test granules of impaired subjects. Result: Fuzzy information granules were constructed and the degree of similarity of fuzzy granules for both able-bodied and impaired MS subjects was determined. Significant differences were observed between the two groups with respect to limb-segments accelerations and GRF data throughout the gait cycle. Conclusion: This work provides an automated gait assessment tool that can be useful for clinician and doctors to identify pathological gait impairments, prescribe treatment, and assess the improvements in response to therapeutic intervention.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1545968312448178","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=15459683&id=doi:10.1177%2F1545968312448178&atitle=An+automated+gait+assessment+tool+based+on+multi-sensors+fusion+and+fuzzy+information+granules&stitle=Neurorehabil.+Neural+Repair&title=Neurorehabilitation+and+Neural+Repair&volume=26&issue=6&spage=657&epage=&aulast=Alaqtash&aufirst=M.&auinit=M.&aufull=Alaqtash+M.&coden=&isbn=&pages=657-&date=2012&auinit1=M&auinitm=","Embase"

The study sought to determine if body-worn sensors could detect differences in balance and gait between people with MS with normal walking speeds and healthy controls. Thirty-one MS and twenty-eight age- and sex-matched control subjects were tested using body-worn sensors both during quiet stance and gait (Timed Up and Go test, TUG). Results were compared to stopwatch-timed measures. Stopwatch durations of the TUG and Timed 25 Foot Walk tests were not significantly different between groups. However, during quiet stance with eyes closed, people with MS had significantly greater sway acceleration amplitude than controls (. p=. 0.02). During gait, people with MS had greater trunk angular range of motion in roll (medio-lateral flexion, . p=. 0.017) and yaw (axial rotation, . p=. 0.026) planes. Turning duration through 180° was also longer in MS (. p=. 0.031). Thus, body-worn motion sensors detected mobility differences between MS and healthy controls when traditional timed tests could not.

The visual conditions were: (1) no vision, (2) natural vision, (3) augmented vision with instantaneous acceleration on a computer display, and (4) augmented vision with instantaneous and past acceleration on a computer display. Acceleration was measured with a 3D accelerometer on the distal phalanx of the index finger(s). The amount of tremor variability did not change as a function of visual information conditions. However, removing visual feedback increased tremor predictability and reduced small, random deviations of tremor acceleration output in the one finger condition. In the two-finger condition, augmented visual information increased the irregularity of the combined tremor variability. The no vision condition showed a stronger coupling between fingers than natural vision or augmented vision with past information. The findings revealed that augmented visual information increased tremor irregularity and facilitated coupling in two-hand tremor dynamics.","Article","10.1007/S00421-011-2239-Y","WOS:000305129300021","WoS"

Insight into underlying mechanisms would help to develop therapeutic strategies. Objective: To explore the relationship of cognitive performance to patterns of nodal centrality derived from magneto-encephalography (MEG). Methods: 34 early relapsing-remitting MS patients (median EDSS 2.0) and 28 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HC) had a MEG, a neuropsychological assessment and structural MRI. Resting-state functional connectivity was determined by the synchronization likelihood. Eigenvector Centrality (EC) was used to quantify for each sensor its connectivity and importance within the network. A cognition-score was calculated, and normalized grey and white matter volumes were determined. EC was compared per sensor and frequency band between groups using permutation testing, and related to cognition. Results: Patients had lower grey and white matter volumes than HC, male patients lower cognitive performance than female patients. In HC, EC distribution showed highest nodal centrality over bi-parietal sensors (""""hubs""""). In patients, nodal centrality was even higher bi-parietally (theta-band) but markedly lower left temporally (upper alpha- and beta-band). Lower cognitive performance correlated to decreased nodal centrality over left temporal (lower alpha-band) and right temporal (beta-band) sensors, and to increased nodal centrality over right parieto-temporal sensors (beta-band). Network changes were most pronounced in male patients. Conclusions: Partial functional disconnection of the temporal regions was associated with cognitive dysfunction in MS; increased centrality in parietal hubs may reflect a shift from temporal to possibly less efficient parietal processing.

Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: University research room. Participants: People with MS who used at most a stick to walk outdoors (MS-A; n=19), people with MS who used bilateral support for gait (MS-B; n=11), and healthy controls (n=15). Interventions: Participants completed 85 minutes of 9 scripted everyday activities. Main Outcome Measures: Estimates of metabolic equivalent thresholds (METs) and kilocalories from a portable metabolic system, and steps counted from video of the activities. Step and MET estimates from an integrative accelerometer and from a uniaxial accelerometer, and kilocalorie estimates from the integrative accelerometer. Results: The uniaxial accelerometer had >30% error for steps for all groups. MET estimates had an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) <0.2 for all groups. For the integrative accelerometer, step estimates for controls had an ICC of.69 and <1% error. The step estimates for MS-A and MS-B groups had >20% error.

These tests have essentially a binary outcome and it is impossible to quantify differences between those who pass the test. Expensive alternatives to quantify postural control ability require force plates or 3D tracking in a gait laboratory. We have used actibelt technology, a 3D accelerometer in a belt buckle (512 MB, 100Hz), validated in a cohort of patients with osteoporosis (1903 tests, 173 patients), to objectively quantify the balance ability of MS patients. Here we were interested in the feasibility and in the construct validity of the test by checking if the numerical values correlate with test difficulty. Methods: Multiple Sclerosis patients (17 female, age: 49.4 ± 9.4 yrs and 11 males, age: 48.7 ± 7.5 yrs, EDSS 4-6.5) were seen at the Hamburg-Eppendorf University Clinic. The following 4 tests were performed with actibelt: Romberg Eyes Open/Closed (R1, R2), Tandem Romberg Eyes Open/Closed (R3, R4). All data were pre-processed and balance parameters were extracted. For the balance test the key outcome is the area covered by the acceleration vector moving in the horizontal plane during the test. A large area means poor balance. This area is measured in “balance units” [1BU=0.96 m(2)/s4] based on the eigenvalues of the best matching ellipse that covers 95% of the “acceleration stabilogram” points. Results: The recordings were transferred to the analysis center. Baseline data from 17 patients, 68 tests in total, could be analysed semi-automatically, data from 1 patient was missing, data from 10 patients need additional inspection by an expert reader. The mean area of the stabilogramm for the test T1-T4 at the baseline visits was (mean [sd] in BU): R1: 0.31 [0.3], R2: 1.12 [2.1], R3: 3.16 [4.0], R4: 5.28 [5.9]. Rank correlation across all tests ρ=0.5, p<0.0001. Conclusion: Balance tests using mobile accelerometry in MS patients are feasible and provide plausible quantitative results. The area of the acceleration stabilogram is increasing with the level of test difficulty. The considerable variability may easily be reduced by repeating the more difficult tests and selection. Modern developments using android smart phones and data communication by bluetooth can provide instant feedback and may facilitate the use as a standard clinical assessment tool - if a costeffective added value can be seen.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458512459021","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13524585&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458512459021&atitle=Construct+validity+of+a+novel+tool+to+measure+balance+ability+in+MS+patients&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=18&issue=4&spage=336&epage=337&aulast=Soaz&aufirst=C.&auinit=C.&aufull=Soaz+C.&coden=&isbn=&pages=336-337&date=2012&auinit1=C&auinitm=","Embase"

In persons with Multiple Sclerosis (pwMS), cardiovascular fitness can be compromised by neurologic impairments and low levels of physical activity. Therefore, we determined the influence of neurological function, walking ability and physical activity on cardiovascular fitness in pwMS Methods: We included 51 ambulatory pwMS (EDSS 0-4.0) in a cross-sectional study. We assessed: cardiovascular fitness (relative VO(2)max, adjusted for age and sex) through bicycle ergospirometry; physical activity (average daily steps) via accelerometry (actibelt®, Trium, Germany) for 7 days; sports activity (sport index of the Baecke Questionnaire); neurological function (EDSS) and walking ability as walking speed in terms of capacity (25-foot walk) and performance (free-living walking speed via accelerometry). We used Spearman's Rho to identify correlations between cardiovascular fitness and EDSS, walking speed and physical and sports activity. We then included significant determinants of VO(2)max in a linear regression model Results: We retrieved complete data from 44 participants (m:8; f:36; EDSS=2,8±0,8; age=39±6; BMI=26,3±2,8). Results: VO(2)peak 26,1±6,0; sport index 2,75±0,63; average daily steps 7632±3321; average walking speed 1.13±0,16 m/ sec; 25-foot walk 4,12±0,94 sec. Relative VO(2)peak was significantly correlated with daily steps (rho=0.566; p<.001), sport index (rho=0,399; p=.007), age (rho=0.315; p=.037) and BMI (rho=-0,486; p=.001), but not with EDSS Score (rho=0,121; p=.435), Timed 25-foot walk (rho=-0,134; p=.385) or freeliving walking speed (rho=0,186; p=.226).In the linear regression model, sport index (standardized b-coefficient=0.293, p=.026), daily steps (b= 0.232, p=.085), age (b= 0.323, p=.005) and BMI (b= -0,43, p=.001) explained 57,4% of the variance in VO(2)peak Conclusion: In ambulatory and physically active pwMS, habitual physical activity and sports activities but not EDSS or walking speed explain large parts of the variance of the VO(2)peak. Daily steps were not correlated to either EDSS or any measure of walking speed (data not shown). Free-living walking speed correlated significantly with the EDSS Score (rho=-0,434; p=.003) and thus might be a valid indicator for neurologic function. Thus, the amount of free-living physical activity might be independent of neurological function.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458512444211","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13524585&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458512444211&atitle=Contributions+of+physical+activity%2C+neurological+function+and+walking+speed+to+cardiovascular+fitness+in+ambulatory+persons+with+multiple+sclerosis+%28%23131%29&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=18&issue=5&spage=S36&epage=S37&aulast=Tallner&aufirst=A.&auinit=A.&aufull=Tallner+A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=S36-S37&date=2012&auinit1=A&auinitm=","Embase"

Smartphone apps plausibly offer a convenient and cost effective means of assessing cognition in MS. Goal: Develop the first generation smartphones apps for assessing cognition in MS that mimic existing clinical measures and patient-oriented surveys. Methods: Smartphones with powerful computer processing, internet access, accelerometers, gyroscopes, light sensors, highdefinition cameras, high-resolution display screens, and an intuitive graphical interface offer the potential for rich, real-time data acquisition that may fundamentally shift the paradigm for diagnosis and monitoring of disease. An open source consortium of academic institutions, patient-advocacy organizations and pharmaceutical companies was created, the MSCODES3 (Multiple Sclerosis Consortium for the Development of Smartphone Support Systems) to develop this idea further. Three natural history studies are planned to develop and assess smartphone applications in MS by the MSCODES3 consortium. The development of four cognitive apps: n-back, trail making, verbal fluency and a continuous performance task for selective and sustained attention will be presented. These focus on the cognitive skills most likely to be affected by MS, information processing speed and working memory. Regular practice may improve performance on these tests, but significant decline in performance, or even reduced learning, may represent a meaningful clinical change. The four cognitive apps developed for the smartphone draw on previous desktop evaluation scales with good psychometric pedigrees. The first of three studies will test the feasibility of longitudinal data collection, data upload and security and subject compliance among other observations. Data from the results from each test completed and the underlying metadata e.g., device and subject identification, time/date stamp for start and completion of each test, local ambient weather information will also be collected. Data will be presented. Conclusions: The MSCODES3 consortium has successfully designed the components of an application suite as a preliminary to testing the potential for smartphones to improve diagnosis and detection of disease progression in MS. Data from this study will be used to further refine and improve the apps for future studies.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458512459021","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13524585&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458512459021&atitle=Developing+paperless%2C+portable+cognitive+applications+for+smartphones&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=18&issue=4&spage=405&epage=406&aulast=Langdon&aufirst=D.&auinit=D.&aufull=Langdon+D.&coden=&isbn=&pages=405-406&date=2012&auinit1=D&auinitm=","Embase"

Background In Multiple Sclerosis, the accurate assessment of disease progression is critical to delivering appropriately individualized care. Smartphones offer the potential for rich, real-time data capture that may fundamentally shift traditional paradigms of clinical monitoring. Design/Methods: We established a consortium to build smartphone technology that tracks clinical changes in MS. The consortium consists of clinicians and scientists with expertise in multiple sclerosis, cognitive psychology, computer science, ethics, and regulatory issues. We plan three consecutive studies: first, to develop a suite of tests for a smartphone platform with encrypted data back-up and field-test the device; second, to expand the range of data collected through the smartphone; third, to assess the utility of this method for monitoring and predicting clinical disease progression. The consortium has created a suite of 21 custom applications for the Android smartphone platform, including standardized MS questionnaires and specific tests of color vision, dexterity, and cognition. Users will be presented approximately 2-5 applications each day, requiring about 5-10 minutes to complete. Collected data will be encrypted and securely stored on a cloud server. Results: The prototype phone, with a suite of clinical tests, is complete. The first study is scheduled to commence in November 2011, and results from this study will guide further development of the smartphone system. Conclusions: The members of this consortium represent a wide range of expertise, and their input has been fundamental to this effort to test the hypothesis that high-density, longitudinal data captured via smartphone technology can enhance the ability to monitor clinical symptoms in MS. Potential benefits of this approach include more accurate predictions of disease progression, improved design of clinical trials, and better treatment decisions for patients with MS and other chronic neurological diseases.","Conference Abstract","10.1212/WNL.78.1","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=00283878&id=doi:10.1212%2FWNL.78.1&atitle=Development+of+smartphone+technology+to+monitor+disease+progression+in+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Neurology&title=Neurology&volume=78&issue=1&spage=&epage=&aulast=Prasad&aufirst=Sashank&auinit=S.&aufull=Prasad+S.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2012&auinit1=S&auinitm=","Embase"

Outcomes for the IDEEA system included percent time walking, sitting, and standing, as well as walking speed. Pearson product corre-lations (r) were used to examine the associations between out-comes from the accelerometer and IDEEA system. Significant correlations were observed between percent walking time and movement counts/hour along the vertical (r = 0.84) and ante-rior-posterior (r = 0.69) axes.

We investigated the association between measurements of the 6MWT and walking speed in the real life situation of MS patients with mild and moderate disability. Methods: MS patients (EDSS: 1-6.5) performed a 6MWT in an outpatient clinic. In a corresponding one-week measurement patients were equipped with a 3D accelerometry hidden in a belt buckle (actibelt) for continuous assessment through 7 days. Walking speed (main parameter), distance and sequences of steps in a row were automatically extracted from the recorded data using standardized software packages. In order to reassess the precision of the speed extraction, patients were also equipped with the actibelt during the 6MWT. Results: 30 patients (67% female) with mean (SD) EDSS 3.6 (1.6) were included in the study. Mean MS duration was 10.7 and mean age 44.4 years. Patients with EDSS 6 or 6.5 (n=5) were not able to complete the 6MWT. In 2 patients (both EDSS 4) the algorithm to determine the walking speed failed. For the remaining 23 patients mean (SD) difference between actual (measured by physician) and actibelt walking speed during the 6MWT was 0.055 (0.188) m/s. Walking sequences of at least 6 minutes are rare in daily life (<1 sequences/day). Even 2 minute sequences occur only typically 3 times per day. Mean daily life walking speed was lower than the 6MWT walking speed (diff.: -0.26 m/s, p=0.002). The difference was larger in patients with EDSS <= 3 (mean walking speed daily life vs. 6MWT: 1.16 m/s vs. 1.53 m/s) compared to those with EDSS 3.5-4.5 (1.08 m/s vs. 1.16 m/s). In real-life walking sequences of >=2min, the 85% quantile of all walking speeds reflects the 6MWT performance of patients with EDSS <=3 (mean diff. < 0.01 m/s). R2 of the corresponding linear model was 0.57 and Pearson's correlation coefficient was 0.755 (p<0.001). Conclusion: 6MWT has limited ecological validity. Ability to complete the 6MWT does not imply that patients typically walk 6 minutes or longer at least once per day in real life situations. For low disability levels the average daily life walking speed was 0.37 (0.14) m/s slower than the 6MWT speed. For higher disability levels 6MWT walking speed was closer to mean real life walking speed. It depends on the clinical question at hand whether the 6MWT is sufficient or if long-term monitoring with mobile accelerometry is needed.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458512444209","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13524585&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458512444209&atitle=Ecological+validity+of+the+6+minute+walking+test+in+MS+patients+%28%2321%29&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=18&issue=5&spage=S19&epage=S20&aulast=Neuhaus&aufirst=A.&auinit=A.&aufull=Neuhaus+A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=S19-S20&date=2012&auinit1=A&auinitm=","Embase"

This recommendation has not been based on physiological considerations such as the rate of oxygen consumption (V * O2) over the 6MW range. Objective: This study examined the pattern of change in V * O2 over the range of the 6MW in a large sample of persons with MS who varied as a function of disability status. METHOD: Ninety-five persons with clinically-definite MS underwent a neurological examination for generating an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score, and then completion of the 6MW protocol while wearing a portable metabolic unit and an accelerometer. Results: There was a time main effect on V * O2 during the 6MW (p = .0001) such that V * O2 increased significantly every 30 seconds over the first 3 minutes of the 6MW, and then remained stable over the second 3 minutes of the 6MW. This occurred despite no change in cadence across the 6MW (p = .84). Conclusions: The pattern of change in V * O2 indicates that there are different metabolic systems providing energy for ambulation during the 6MW in MS subjects and steady state aerobic metabolism is reached during the last 3 minutes of the 6MW. By extension, the first 3 minutes would represent a test of mixed aerobic and anaerobic work, whereas the second 3 minutes would represent a test of aerobic work during walking.","Article in Press","10.1186/1471-2377-12-6","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14712377&id=doi:10.1186%2F1471-2377-12-6&atitle=Evidence+for+the+different+physiological+significance+of+the+6-+and+2-minute+walk+tests+in+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=&title=BMC+Neurology&volume=&issue=&spage=6&epage=&aulast=Motl&aufirst=Robert+W.&auinit=R.W.&aufull=Motl+R.W.&coden=&isbn=&pages=6-&date=2012&auinit1=R&auinitm=W","Embase"

Moreover, we have found that the effect of training with such cues lasts beyond the training period. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of training with visual and auditory feedback cues on the walking abilities of patients with gait disorders due to cerebral palsy. Materials and Methods: Visual and auditory feedback cues were generated by a wearable device, driven by inertial sensors. Ten randomly selected patients with gait disorders due to cerebral palsy and seven age-matched healthy individual trained with visual feedback cues while ten patients and eight age-matched healthy individual trained with auditory feedback cues. Baseline performance (walking speed and stride length along a 10 m straight track) was measured before device use. Following 20 min training with the device, and a 20 min break, performance without the device was measured again and compared to the baseline performance. Results: For the patients who trained with visual feedback, the average improvement was 21.70% ± 36.06% in the walking speed and 8.72% ± 9.47% in the stride length. For the patients who trained with auditory feedback, the average improvement was 25.43% ± 28.65% in the walking speed and 13.58% ± 13.10% in the stride length. These results were confirmed at the 0.95 significance level. For the controls who trained with visual feedback, the average improvement was -2.41% ± 9.54% in the walking speed and -2.84% ± 10.11% in the stride length. For the controls who trained with auditory feedback, the average improvement was 0.01% ± 7.73% in the walking speed and -2.03% ± 6.15% in the stride length. Discussion: The results of the present study support the potential role of sensory feedback-based strategies as rehabilitation modalities, and substantiate their specific implementation in efforts to alleviate, improve, and restore mobility in patients with gait disturbances due to CP. For patients using visual feedback, baseline walking speed and stride length were found to be good predictors of improvement, with higher improvement associated with lower baseline performance. For patients using such cues, age was found to be a good predictor of improvement in walking speed, but not in stride length, with significantly higher improvement in walking speed found in patients of older age. For patients using auditory feedback, baseline performance was found to be a good predictor of improvement in walking.

Specific: (a) determine whether a phone's accelerometer has sensitivity comparable to those of laboratory tools, and (b) determine whether it is possible to analyse tremor amplitude and spectral characteristics directly on the smart phone. Background: In laboratories, pathological tremor is usually quantified and characterized with accelerometers. This type of device can be found in new emerging technology, i.e. smart phones. We propose to use this type of device to “quantitatively” assess tremor characteristics in and outside the clinic. Methods: Study 1: Simulated pathological tremor was recorded simultaneously with a smart phone, a laser and an accelerometer. Time series of all devices were analysed offline and then compared to each other. Next, similar comparisons were performed using results obtained from online analysis of time series by algorithms integrated in the device. Study 2: Tremor of 12 patients (Parkinson's Disease, Essential Tremor and Multiple Sclerosis) and 6 healthy participants was recorded and analysed using a beta version of our smart phone application. Tremor was recorded in 3 different conditions: rest, postural and intention. Tremor amplitude obtained with the smart phone was then compared to scores obtained using a customdesigned clinical scale. Results: Study 1: Correlations between data from the smart phone and laboratory tools were high for amplitude, median power frequency and power distribution of the spectral tremor characteristics (r>0.92). However, power dispersion characteristics were affected by a floor effect that influenced the correlation coefficient. Correlations between data analysed by our usual algorithms performed on computer and the algorithms implemented within the smart phone were very high (r>0.96). Study 2: Tremor amplitude obtained with the smart phone was highly correlated with clinical scores (r>0.85). Moreover, spectral data allowed us to identify a prominent peak in patients with higher tremor amplitude. Conclusions: Smart phones are sensitive enough to detect and quantify pathological tremor. Moreover, it is possible to perform complex spectral analyses directly on the smart phone, allowing for more powerful assessment of pathological tremors.","Conference Abstract","10.1002/MDS.25051","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=08853185&id=doi:10.1002%2Fmds.25051&atitle=Identifying+different+pathological+tremor+characteristics+with+a+smart+phone&stitle=Mov.+Disord.&title=Movement+Disorders&volume=27&issue=&spage=S407&epage=S408&aulast=Carignan&aufirst=B.&auinit=B.&aufull=Carignan+B.&coden=&isbn=&pages=S407-S408&date=2012&auinit1=B&auinitm=","Embase"

Methods: MS subjects with normal walking speeds (N=31) and age- and sex-matched control subjects (N=19) were tested using wireless sensors on the lower legs, lumbar back, sternum and wrists for the Timed Up and Go test and during 30-second trials of quiet stance with eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC). Fifty gait and 42 sway metrics were calculated using automated software. Clinical tests included the Timed 25 Foot Walk (T25FW), and self-rated disability, gait and balance questionnaires. Tests were repeated at 6 month intervals for 18 months. To assess longitudinal changes in objective measures and group differences, we performed a linear mixed model analysis. Results: Gait and balance parameters (e.g. excessive postural sway area EC, reduced jerkiness of sway EC, excessive trunk rotation during gait) that distinguished mild MS from controls at the baseline visit continued to do so for most follow-up visits. Parameters most consistently distinguishing MS from controls related primarily to balance (p values from each visit demonstrating significant group differences): sway range EC (0.01, 0.001, 0.03, 0.007), sway area ratio EO/EC (0.004, 0.004, 0.05, 0.02), and normalized Jerk EC (0.04, 0.03, 0.02). Stride velocity during gait (0.02, 0.05) and sway area EC (0.007, 0.02) less consistently distinguished MS from controls. The T25FW failed to separate MS from controls at all time points. While no parameter worsened over time using group analysis, one subgroup improved while another worsened. Further subgroup analysis will determine which subjects improved versus worsened over time. Conclusions: Body-worn sensors consistently distinguished mild MS from controls over 18 months while stopwatch-timed tests could not. The availability of small, wireless, body-worn sensors may provide sensitive, reliable and feasible outcome measures for clinical trials and practice.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458512459021","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13524585&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458512459021&atitle=Longitudinal+measures+of+instrumented+gait+and+balance+in+multiple+sclerosis+over+18+months&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=18&issue=4&spage=330&epage=331&aulast=Spain&aufirst=R.&auinit=R.&aufull=Spain+R.&coden=&isbn=&pages=330-331&date=2012&auinit1=R&auinitm=","Embase"

(#32)","Multiple Sclerosis",2012,"Objective: Fatigue is a common disabling and serious symptom in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Yet, to date only few methods for the objective assessment of fatigue are available. Commonly, fatigue is assessed using self-report scales. The goal of this study was to develop a method for the objective assessment of motor fatigue based on kinematic gait parameters, heart rate and lactate level during a physical exertion test. Methods: Patients with clinically determined definite MS participated in this study. Fatigue was defined according to the Fatigue Scale for Motor and Cognition (FSMC). Participants were divided into two groups based on the level of their motor fatigue (MS patients with fatigue, MS patients without fatigue). Patients underwent a physical exertion test involving walking at 10% above their pre-determined patient-specific preferred walking speed until they reached a value of 17 on the Borg scale. Heart rate and lactate level were measured at the beginning and at the end of the exertion test. Gait data were recorded using two video cameras, a three line-scanning camera system with ten infrared sensors and inertial sensors (accelerometer and gyroscope). Means and standard deviations (SD) of these spatial and temporal parameters during one-minute intervals at the beginning and end of the exertion test were computed and compared using paired t-tests (α=0.005). Results: To date, 30 patients with fatigue (19 females and 11 males; age: 46±7.2 years; max. distance: 1690±1069m; walking speed: 2.9±1.3km/h) and one patient without fatigue (male, age: 48 years; distance: 5579m; walking speed: 5km/h) participated in this study. Patient enrollment continues through February 2012, and data collection for at least another 14 subjects without fatigue is anticipated. All but one patient with fatigue reached complete exhaustion. MS patients with fatigue showed visually observable gait changes with physical exertion. The patient without fatigue did not reach complete exhaustion and showed no obvious changes in his gait pattern. Conclusion: We expect that the changes in gait patterns following a physical exertion test are specific to the presence of motor fatigue in MS patients and that these changes can be measured objectively. The extent of these changes in gait patterns can be described using the motor fatigue index. The results of this study have important consequence for the assessments and treatment evaluations of fatigue in MS.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458512444211","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13524585&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458512444211&atitle=Objective+assessment+of+motor+fatigue+in+multiple+sclerosis+using+a+physical+exertion+test.+%28%2332%29&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=18&issue=5&spage=S39&epage=&aulast=Sehle&aufirst=A.&auinit=A.&aufull=Sehle+A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=S39-&date=2012&auinit1=A&auinitm=","Embase"

This study compared physical activity levels between large samples of persons with mild MS and matched controls using validated measures of physical activity. Materials and methods: The sample included 77 cases of MS and 77 controls matched on age, height, weight, and gender. Physical activity was assessed using five measures, namely the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ), International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), and activity counts per day, step counts per day, and time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) per day by accelerometry. Results: There were statistically significant differences between groups in accelerometer activity counts (t = -3.87, P = 0.0001), accelerometer step counts (t = -4.29, P = 0.0001), time spent in MVPA (t = -2.39, P = 0.01), GLTEQ scores (t = -3.83, P = 0.0001), and IPAQ scores (t = -3.42, P = 0.0001). The average effect size across all five measures was d = -0.59 and indicated that persons with MS overall were moderately less physically active than the matched controls. Conclusions: The primary finding was a moderate reduction in physical activity among those with MS, but the magnitude was substantially smaller than reported in a published meta-analysis. Importantly, the degree of physical inactivity can likely be overcome through the delivery of behavioral interventions for increasing physical activity and this should translate into meaningful consequences for persons with MS. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.","Article","10.1111/J.1600-0404.2011.01634.X","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=00016314&id=doi:10.1111%2Fj.1600-0404.2011.01634.x&atitle=Physical+activity+and+multiple+sclerosis%3A+New+insights+regarding+inactivity&stitle=Acta+Neurol.+Scand.&title=Acta+Neurologica+Scandinavica&volume=126&issue=4&spage=256&epage=262&aulast=Sandroff&aufirst=B.M.&auinit=B.M.&aufull=Sandroff+B.M.&coden=ANRSA&isbn=&pages=256-262&date=2012&auinit1=B&auinitm=M","Embase"

Despite this, very little is known about the antecedents and consequences of self-esteem in persons with MS. Objectives: To examine (1) physical activity and social support as potentially modifiable correlates (i.e., antecedents) of self-esteem and (2) physical and psychological health-related quality of life as possible consequences of self-esteem in persons with MS. Methods: Participants (N = 46) wore an Actigraph accelerometer for 7 days and then completed a battery of questionnaires, including the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES), Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29), and Social Provisions Scale (SPS). The data were analyzed using PASW Statistics 18. Results: Bivariate correlation analysis indicated that average daily step counts (r = .298, p = .026) and social support (r = .366, p = .007) were significantly correlated with self-esteem. Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that only social support was a significant predictor of self-esteem scores (β = .411, p = .004); pedometer steps approached significance as a predictor of self-esteem (β = .178, p = .112). Bivariate correlation analysis further indicated significant negative associations between self-esteem and physical (r = -.391, p = .004) and psychological (r = -.540, p = .0001) domains of health-related quality of life (HRQOL), indicating that higher self-esteem was associated with more positive HRQOL.

However, no studies to date have systematically evaluated the benefits of an intervention for both managing fatigue and promoting physical activity in individuals with MS. This study involves a randomized controlled trial to examine the effectiveness of a telehealth intervention that supports individuals with MS in managing fatigue and increasing physical activity levels.Methods/Design: A randomly-allocated, three-parallel group, time-series design with a social support program serving as the control group will be used to accomplish the purpose of the study. Our goal is to recruit 189 ambulatory individuals with MS who will be randomized into one of three telehealth interventions: (1) a contact-control social support intervention, (2) a physical activity-only intervention, and (3) a physical activity plus fatigue management intervention. All interventions will last 12 weeks and will be delivered entirely over the phone. Our hypothesis is that, in comparison to the contact-control condition, both the physical activity-only intervention and the physical activity plus fatigue management intervention will yield significant increases in physical activity levels as well as improve fatigue and health and function, with the physical activity plus fatigue management intervention yielding significantly larger improvements. To test this hypothesis, outcome measures will be administered at Weeks 1, 12, and 24. Primary outcomes will be the Fatigue Impact Scale, the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ), and Actigraph accelerometers. Secondary outcomes will include the SF-12 Survey, Mental Health Inventory, Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale, the Community Participation Indicator, and psychosocial constructs (e.g., self-efficacy).Discussion: The proposed study is novel, in that it represents a multi-disciplinary effort to merge two promising lines of research on MS: fatigue management and physical activity promotion.

Robot-assisted gait training (RAGT) has been suggested as an intervention to improve walking capacity in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Objective. This study aimed to evaluate whether RAGT (Lokomat) is superior to over-ground walking training in terms of quality of life, activity level, and gait. Methods. A total of 67 patients with MS with the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) 3.0 to 6.5 were randomized to walking or RAGT, in addition to multimodal rehabilitation. Primary outcomes were walking speed, activity level (estimated metabolic equivalent, metabolic equivalents [METs], using an accelerometer), and quality of life (Well-Being Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and EQ-5D European VAS. Results. In all, 49 patients finished the interventions. Mean age was 56 years (range 36-74 years), mean EDSS was 5.8 (3.0-6.5), and the preferred walking speed at baseline was 0.56 m/s (0.06-1.43 m/s). Before rehabilitation, participants spent on average 68 min/d at an MET ≥3. The walking group improved gait speed nonsignificantly more than the RAGT; the upper bound of the confidence interval (CI) did not exclude a clinically relevant benefit (defined as a difference of 0.05 m/s) in favor of the walking group; the lower bound of the CI did exclude a clinically important benefit in favor of the Lokomat. Quality of life improved in both groups, with a nonsignificant between-group difference in favor of the walking group. Both groups had reduced their activity by 8 weeks after the rehabilitation.

The clinical utility of these outcome measures are unclear, as well as whether an increase of scores also culminates in similar positive effects on the habitual use of the upper limbs in daily life. The objective was to determine the relationship between habitual use of the dominant and non-dominant arm measured by accelerometry and clinical outcome measures. Methods: Thirty PwMS with unilateral or bilateral upper limb dysfunction were included. Clinical outcome measures on function level were the Motricity Index (MI), hand grip strength and Brunnström Fugl Meyer (BFM). On activity level, the Action Research Arm test and Nine Hole Peg Test were conducted. Habitual use of the upper limbs was measured subjectively by the Motor Activity Log (MAL) and objectively by the use of accelerometry (Motionloggers®). The Motionloggers® were bilaterally attached to the wrist during 1 week. Output of the Motionloggers® was presented in 3 different modes: frequency of movement, time spent in motion and intensity of motion. A Wilcoxon Signed Rank test was used to investigate the difference between dominant and non-dominant arm. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated to quantify the relationship between the habitual upper limb use and clinical outcome measures. Multiple regression models with a stepwise selection procedure were performed. Results: A significant difference (p<0.05) was found between dominant and non-dominant arm for all outcome measures. For the dominant arm, all correlations were remarkably lower (r<0.46) compared to the non-dominant arm (r>0.63). The highest S22correlations for non-dominant arm were found between intensity of motion measured by the Motionloggers® and the function level outcome measures MI (r=0.78) and BFM (r=0.78) in contrast to correlations with the activity level outcome measures. Selfreported habitual use measured with the MAL correlated high (r=0.77) with objectively measured intensity of habitual use. For the dominant arm the MI was the best predictor for intensity of habitual upper limb use (R(2)=0.20). The BFM and MAL were good predictors for the intensity of habitual use of the non-dominant arm (R(2)=0.61). Conclusion: Outcome measures of function level and a selfreported measure of habitual use are most predictive for the intensity of habitual upper limb use in PwMS with upper limb dysfunction due to muscle weakness, and greatest for the non-dominant arm.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458512444209","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13524585&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458512444209&atitle=Upper+limb+use+in+multiple+sclerosis%3A+Relationship+between+accelerometry+and+clinical+outcome+measures+%28%2353%29&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=18&issue=5&spage=S20&epage=S21&aulast=Lamers&aufirst=I.&auinit=I.&aufull=Lamers+I.&coden=&isbn=&pages=S20-S21&date=2012&auinit1=I&auinitm=","Embase"

RESULTS: Algorithms for tremor recording and online analysis can be implemented within a smart phone. The smart phone provides reliable time- and frequency-domain tremor characteristics. The smart phone can also provide medically-relevant tremor assessments. DISCUSSION: Smart phones have the potential to provide researchers and clinicians with quantitative short- and long-term tremor assessments that are currently not easily available. METHODS: A smart phone application for tremor quantification and online analysis was developed. Then, smart phone results were compared to those obtained simultaneously with a laboratory accelerometer. Finally, results from the smart phone were compared to clinical tremor assessments. © 2012 Daneault, Carignan, Codère, Sadikot and Duval.","Article","10.3389/FNHUM.2012.00357","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=16625161&id=doi:10.3389%2Ffnhum.2012.00357&atitle=Using+a+smart+phone+as+a+standalone+platform+for+detection+and+monitoring+of+pathological+tremors&stitle=Front.+Human+Neurosci.&title=Frontiers+in+Human+Neuroscience&volume=&issue=DEC&spage=1&epage=31&aulast=Daneault&aufirst=Jean-Fran%C3%A7ois&auinit=J.&aufull=Daneault+J.&coden=&isbn=&pages=1-31&date=2012&auinit1=J&auinitm=","Embase"

Disability status and progression are associated with reduced physical activity (PA) and cardiovascular function. Lack of adequate PA combined with inflammation may create high susceptibility to subclinical atherosclerosis and vascular dysfunction. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to compare subclinical atherosclerosis and arterial function between individuals with and without MS matched for age, sex, and body mass index. Methods: Thirty-three individuals diagnosed with MS and 33 controls underwent strain gauge plethysmography for resting forearm blood flow (FBF) and peak reactive hyperemia for the microvascular function. Intima-media thickness and arterial compliance (AC) were measured using carotid ultrasound for vascular function. C-reactive protein and PA (7-d accelerometer data) were also measured. Results: There was a significant difference (P G 0.05) in resting FBF, peak reactive hyperemia, central pulse wave velocity, and AC between the MS and control groups. PA was associated with peak FBF and central pulse wave velocity but not FBF and carotid AC. Individuals with MS exhibit reduced arterial function but similar intima-media thickness compared with controls. Persons with MS had significantly reduced PA levels compared with controls, and PA accounted for differences in arterial function between groups. Conclusions: These results indicate that subclinical markers of atherosclerosis are higher in individuals with MS, suggesting a higher risk of cardiovascular disease in this population. However, the higher levels of subclinical atherosclerosis were accounted for by the low PA in persons with MS, suggesting that increasing PA may reduce the increase in cardiovascular disease risk in patients with MS.

In the pivotal trial which led to the FDA's approval in January 2010, fampridine-SR responders (approximately one third of participants) showed a sustainable improvement of 25% in walking speed during a timed 25ft walk test (T25-FW). The EMA however only gave a licence on condition that long-term efficacy and clinically meaningful outcome parameters regarding walking ability will be further investigated. Methods: All included patients attended our clinic for inpatient rehabilitation and were treated with physiotherapy as well as fampridine- SR. The individual response to fampridine-SR was evaluated according to the WIWA-test (Windsheimer Walking-Ability-Test). This multi-dimensional test battery consists of the T25-FW, the 6-min walk test (6MWT), the EDSS scale, combined with real-life data from accelerometry collected over 3-4 days (actibeltR, tri-axial accelerometer, 512MB, 100 Hz, battery life 10 days) and subjective data using self-assessment on a visual analogue scale. To measure the effects on quality of life the Hamburg Quality of Life Questionnaire for Multiple Sclerosis (HAQUAMS) was used. A subgroup of patients was additionally documented by video recordings. Results: First results indicate that more than the expected third of included patients seem to benefit from the treatment according to published response criteria. Preliminary data show a correlation of the patient's subjective experience and the objective data from T25-FW, the 6MWT, and accelerometry. Conclusion: We present the WIWA-test, a versatile evaluation tool for measuring the effects of fampridine-SR on walking ability. In addition to clinical and more subjective criteria mobile accelerometry provides information about objective parameters related to mobility, e.g. level of physical activity, number of steps, maximum walking distance and mean walking velocity in daily life. The higher response rates in patients, irrespective of the method of evaluation, may be explained by additional effects of multi-modal rehabilitation (physiotherapy, aerobic training, trunk stabilisation). Further research is needed to determine the best thresholds to separate fampridine-responders from non-responders and to evaluate independently the effect size and sustainability of the impact of medical treatment and physiotherapy on appropriate outcome measures.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458512444209","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13524585&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458512444209&atitle=WIWA-Test+for+measuring+benefit+of+fampridine-SR+in+MS+patients%3A+A+multi-dimensional+tool+including+accelerometry+%28%2351%29&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=18&issue=5&spage=S20&epage=&aulast=Lehrieder&aufirst=G.&auinit=G.&aufull=Lehrieder+G.&coden=&isbn=&pages=S20-&date=2012&auinit1=G&auinitm=","Embase"

A better knowledge of the affections that influence the adhesion capability of cells in several pathologies, such as cancer diseases or multiple sclerosis could enable the development of new therapeutical strategies. Whereas the optimal control of cell adhesion and growth on new technological materials is a primary issue in modern tissue engineering, few techniques are able to provide quantitative and reliable results on cell adhesion. We present a method that enables the investigation of cell adhesion at the single cell level and provides the capability to test the adhesion of a single cell on multifunctional substrates. To reach this goal we applied single cell force spectroscopy (SCFS) on custom designed patterns of molecules prepared on a rigid substrate by using a cantilever based molecule deposition tool, and we tested the adhesion of Chinese Hamster Ovary cells and Human Embrionic Kidney cells on two polyelectrolytes that are widely used as adhesive factors for cells growth: Polyethylenimine and Poly-D-Lysine. Our results confirm the common hypothesis on the mechanism of adhesion promotion by protonated molecules. Optimizations of the experimental settings of SFCS experiment are introduced here.

It has been shown to improve walking using clinic-based (Timed 25-foot (7.62m) walk)-, and self-assessment measures. Accelerometers provide continuous measurement of intensity of walking (strides/minute) and total amount of walking (steps/day) during daily activities. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of D-ER on accelerometer-based measures in people with MS. Methods: This was a single-center, double-blind, placebo (PBO) controlled cross-over study. Subjects with MS were randomized (1:1) to 4 weeks on D-ER 10mg twice daily and 4 weeks on PBO in either order (D-ER-PBO, N = 22; PBO-D-ER, N = 21) with a 2-week washout in between. Patients wore Stepwatch3 accelerometers to record daily walking activity for 7 days at baseline and at week 3 of each on-drug study period. The primary outcome measure was the peak activity index (PAI), defined as the fastest individual 30 minutes of the day in strides/minute. Secondary outcomes were accelerometer measures of daily step count, time spent in no activity, and maximum activity rates for 20 continuous minutes. Other secondary outcomes were 6-minute Walk Test (6MWT), Timed Up-and-Go Test (TUG), Physical Activity and Disability Scale-Revised (PADS-R), 12-item MS Walking Scale (MSWS-12), and Subject Global Impression (SGI). Statistical analysis used a mixed model accounting for sequence and period effects and sensitivity analyses. Results: There were 43 randomized patients with average age of 54.1 years, disease duration of 13.4 years and expanded disability status scale score of 5.17. Baseline characteristics were similar except for gender: 19(86%) and 11(52%) women in the D-ERPBO and PBO-D-ER group, respectively. One subject from each group withdrew early. The change from baseline on the PAI was 0.6±0.54 strides/min on D-ER and 0.3±0.55 for PBO (p = 0.586, least squares mean±standard error). Change in daily step count was 148.7±222.4 on D-ER and 128.0±225.4 on PBO(p = 0.94). Other accelerometer-based measures and the 6MWT, MSWS-12, and SGI showed no significant differences between D-ER and PBO. TUG(p = 0.042) and PADS-R(p = 0.021) favored D-ER. There were no serious adverse events and the numbers of mild or moderate adverse events with possible relationship to drug were 22 on D-ER and 22 on PBO. Conclusions: D-ER did not change accelerometer-based measures of ambulatory activity relative to PBO.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458513502429","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13524585&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458513502429&atitle=A+randomized%2C+placebo-controlled%2C+double-blind%2C+crossover+trial+of+effect+of+extended+release+dalfampridine+on+ambulatory+activity+in+people+with+multiple+sclerosis%3A+Preliminary+results&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=19&issue=11&spage=523&epage=524&aulast=Brown&aufirst=T.&auinit=T.&aufull=Brown+T.&coden=&isbn=&pages=523-524&date=2013&auinit1=T&auinitm=","Embase"
"558","Hadavi S., Giovannoni G., Dobson R.","A service development audit of fampridine use in MS","Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry",2013,"Background Impairment of walking and the resultant reduction in physical function together with pathological fatigue are major concerns for patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Patients are in need of interventions to improve walking. Slow-release 4-aminopyridine (Fampridine; Fampyra) improves walking speed in approximately 35% of MS patients. The Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW) is used to measure response to treatment. There are concerns that the T25FW is a poor estimate of walking speed, and only able to provide a snapshot of walking impairment under controlled circumstances. Funding bodies have raised uncertainties regarding the possibility of increased falls with Fampridine. Objectives T25FW is not the most pragmatic measure of either walking impairment and or Fampridine efficacy. Alternative objective outcome measures including accelerometry or longer walking distance tests may be more informative of patients' walking ability in real-life situations. We therefore set out to evaluate objective and subjective outcome measures of walking impairment, falls risk and fatigability for use in MS patients. Methods Thirty-two MS patients underwent a battery of objective and subjective assessments, including 48-hour accelerometry. Appropriate statistical tests were selected for data analysis. Pearson correlation coefficient and Spearman's rho were used for parametric and non-parametric data, respectively. Group mean comparisons were made using the un- paired t-test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) on parametric data, and Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal- Wallis test on non-parametric data. Results The study group consisted of 13 women and 19 male (5 primary progressive, 19 secondary progressive, and 8 relapsing-remitting; EDSS range 2.5-7). Median age was 48.5, (range 30-68). All patients had fallen in the past 6 months, and 19 used an assistive device at all times. The mean duration since MS diagnosis was 8.3 years (SD=6.6). T25FW, 2-minute walk (2MWT) and average daily activity measured by accelerometry showed significant correlations with all other objective measures of walking impairment. The MS walking scale-12 (MSWS-12) correlated significantly with T25FWand 2MWT. The Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) scale scores increased significantly with higher falls frequency (p=0.03). Assistive device use was significantly associated with worse scores on all subjective and objective tools, and with falls frequency. Accelerometry was a discriminator of physical fatigability in MS patients, when comparing the average activity in the morning with the average activity in the afternoon. Patients in this study suffering from fatigue were less active in the afternoon compared to the early morning (p=0.01). Conclusions The 2MWTand accelerometry are good objective measures of walking disability in addition to the T25FW. Accelerometry provides additional real-life data regarding activity during the day, and offers information regarding the impact of fatigue on a patient. The MSWS-12 subjectively measures impact of walking disability and the ABC score predicts falls. The use of an assistive device identifies walking disability and predicts risk of falls. Given the uncertainty regarding falls risk in patients using fampridine, physicians should consider using these tools to monitor patients under consideration for the drug.","Conference Abstract","10.1136/JNNP-2013-306573.178","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=00223050&id=doi:10.1136%2Fjnnp-2013-306573.178&atitle=A+service+development+audit+of+fampridine+use+in+MS&stitle=J.+Neurol.+Neurosurg.+Psychiatry&title=Journal+of+Neurology%2C+Neurosurgery+and+Psychiatry&volume=84&issue=11&spage=&epage=&aulast=Hadavi&aufirst=Shahrzad&auinit=S.&aufull=Hadavi+S.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2013&auinit1=S&auinitm=","Embase"

For pathological populations, changes in variability during gait signal the presence of abnormal motor control strategies. For persons with multiple sclerosis (PwMS), extensive gait problems have been reported including changes in gait variability. While previous studies have focused on footfall variability, the present study used accelerometers on the trunk to measure variability during walking. Thus, the purpose of this study was to examine the variability of the acceleration pattern of the upper and lower trunk in PwMS compared to healthy controls. We extracted linear and nonlinear measures of gait variability from 30 s of steady state walking for 15 PwMS and 15 age-matched healthy controls. PwMS had altered variability compared to controls with greater Lyapunov exponent in the ML (p < 0.001) and AP (p < 0.001) directions, and greater frequency dispersion in the ML direction (p = 0.034). PwMS also demonstrated greater mean velocity in the ML direction (p = 0.045) and lower root mean square of acceleration in the AP direction (p = 0.040).

Across several clinical trials, the reported rates of neutralizing-antibody formation were 22%-47% (Betaseron®), 5%-35% (Rebif®), and 2%-13% (Avonex®). In the current study, all products were purchased from the pharmacy and aggregates were characterized and/or quantified using size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), analytical ultracentrifugation, gel electrophoresis, and dot-blotting immunoassays. Particle characterization and counting were performed using microflow imaging, particle tracking analysis, and resonant mass measurement. Betaseron® and Rebif®, which are formulated with human serum albumin, had the greatest amount of aggregated protein and particles (e.g., 9%-15% high molecular weight species by SEC and >100,000 particles/mL by flow imaging). Avonex® was found to have the least amount of aggregated protein, with >95% monomer content by both SEC and analytical ultracentrifugation, and the particles detected in Avonex® were determined to be primarily silicone oil droplets.

MCID estimates were based on regression analyses and analysis of variance for between group differences.Results:The mean MCID from self-report scales that capture subtle changes in ambulation (1-point change in PDSS scores and 10-point change in MSWS-12 scores) was 779 steps/day (14% of mean score for MS sample); the mean MCID for clinical/health outcomes (MS type, duration, weight status) was 1,455 steps/day (26% of mean score for MS sample); real-life anchors (unemployment, divorce, assistive device use) resulted in a mean MCID of 2,580 steps/day (45% of mean score for MS sample); and the MCID for the cumulative impact of MS (MS vs. control) was 2,747 steps/day (48% of mean score for MS sample).Conclusion:The change in motion sensor output of ~800 steps/day appears to represent a lower-bound estimate of clinically meaningful change in free-living walking behavior in interventions of MS. © 2013 Motl et al.","Article","10.1371/JOURNAL.PONE.0073247","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=19326203&id=doi:10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0073247&atitle=Clinical+Importance+of+Steps+Taken+per+Day+among+Persons+with+Multiple+Sclerosis&stitle=PLoS+ONE&title=PLoS+ONE&volume=8&issue=9&spage=&epage=&aulast=Motl&aufirst=Robert+W.&auinit=R.W.&aufull=Motl+R.W.&coden=POLNC&isbn=&pages=-&date=2013&auinit1=R&auinitm=W","Embase"

Their efficacy on clinical and radiological parameters has been clearly demonstrated in several clinical trials (CT) over the past two decades. All this progress, not only in terms of MS therapeutics but also in terms of CT methodology, has led to an urgent need for sensitive and clinically relevant outcome measures. Relapse rate and Kurtzke's Expanded Disability Status Scale remain the standard assessments, but the MS Functional Composite has also gained some interest as a meaningful measure. As we have not yet a scale that objectively covers all major issues (validity, reliability and responsiveness to change over time), we are still using in modern CT those somewhat old (but robust) scales, which claim for further improvement. In this paper, the main advantages and disadvantages of currently available measurement tools are discussed and some light is shed upon future perspectives on this attractive and expanding field. © sociedade Portuguesa da Neurologia.

Methods: Cross-sectional study of 159 MS patients first identified candidate T25FW benchmarks. To characterize the clinical meaningfulness of T25FW benchmarks, we ascertained their relationships to real-life anchors, functional independence, and physiologic measurements of gait and disease progression. Candidate T25FW benchmarks were then prospectively validated in 95 subjects using 13 measures of ambulation and cognition, patient-reported outcomes, and optical coherence tomography.Results: T25FW of 6 to 7.99 seconds was associated with a change in occupation due to MS,occupational disability, walking with a cane, and needing """"some help"""" with instrumental activities of daily living; T25FW ≥8 seconds was associated with collecting Supplemental Security Income and government health care, walking with a walker, and inability to do instrumental activities of daily living. During prospective benchmark validation, we trichotomized data by T25FW benchmarks (<6 seconds, 6-7.99 seconds, and ≥8 seconds) and found group main effects on 12 of 13 objective and subjective measures (p < 0.05).

The applied measures of walking ability were the following: the single-item and patient-rated Walking Ability Visual Analogue Scale (WA-VAS), the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), the 25-foot walk test (25FWT), the Six Spot Step Test (SSST), the 2 min timed walk (2 min TW), the Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale-12 (MSWS-12), and step activity monitor accelerometer (SAM) during 7 day period. The SAM analysis included the average daily step count, the average steps/min of the highest 1 min of a day, and the average steps/min of the highest continuous 60 min of a day. The WA-VAS scores significantly and strongly correlated with EDSS (ρ = 0.679, P < 0.001), 25FWT (ρ = 0.606, P < 0.001), SSST (ρ = 0.729, P < 0.001), 2 min TW (ρ = -0.643, P < 0.001), MSWS-12 (ρ = 0.746, P < 0.001), average daily step count (ρ = -0.507, P < 0.001), average steps/min of the highest 1 min of a day (ρ = -0.544, P < 0.001), and average steps/min of the highest continuous 60 min of a day (ρ = -0.473, P < 0.001).

The G protein (heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein)-coupled receptor (GPCR) GPR17, which is phylogenetically closely related to receptors of the """"purinergic cluster,"""" has emerged as a modulator of CNS myelination. However, whether GPR17-mediated signaling positively or negatively regulates this critical process is unresolved. We identified a small-molecule agonist, MDL29,951, that selectively activated GPR17 even in a complex environment of endogenous purinergic receptors in primary oligodendrocytes. MDL29,951-stimulated GPR17 engaged the entire set of intracellular adaptor proteins for GPCRs: G proteins of the Gα (i), Gα(s), and Gα(q) subfamily, as well as β-arrestins. This was visualized as alterations in the concentrations of cyclic adenosine monophosphate and inositol phosphate, increased Ca (2+) flux, phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), as well as multifeatured cell activation recorded with label-free dynamic mass redistribution and impedance biosensors. MDL29,951 inhibited the maturation of primary oligodendrocytes from heterozygous but not GPR17 knockout mice in culture, as well as in cerebellar slices from 4-day-old wild-type mice. Because GPCRs are attractive targets for therapeutic intervention, inhibiting GPR17 emerges as therapeutic strategy to relieve the oligodendrocyte maturation block and promote myelin repair in MS.","Article","10.1126/SCISIGNAL.2004350","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=19450877&id=doi:10.1126%2Fscisignal.2004350&atitle=Decoding+signaling+and+function+of+the+orphan+g+protein-coupled+receptor+GPR17+with+a+small-molecule+agonist&stitle=Sci.+Signal.&title=Science+Signaling&volume=6&issue=298&spage=&epage=&aulast=Hennen&aufirst=Stephanie&auinit=S.&aufull=Hennen+S.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2013&auinit1=S&auinitm=","Embase"

Fatigue in the context of MS is a complex symptom that affects 75-95% of all patients, of which 50-60 % classify fatigue as interfering most seriously with the activities of daily life resulting in early retirement requests and inability to work. Aim: This pilot telehealth study will evaluate whether telecoaching with a focus on energy management and enhancement of physical activity is able to improve fatigue in MS patients with moderate to severe fatigue during a 12 week-period. Methodology: 40 MS patients with moderate to severe fatigue are being followed during 12 weeks in their home setting, with 4 assessments. Inclusion criteria for participants include the diagnosis of relapsing remitting MS, an EDSS of 4 or lower, treatment with glatiramer acetate for at least 6 weeks and a score of 53 or higher on the Fatigue Scale for Motor and Cognitive functions (FSMC). Patients with age 55 or above, with major depressive disorder, with severe cognitive impairment, injuries and pregnant patients were excluded. In a 2 week run-in period, daily activity is measured using the mobile MS TeleCoach handhold device. During the 12 week follow-up phase, fatigue is measured 3 times a day using the VAS-1 impact on fatigue question and physical activity is continuously monitored via an integrated accelerometer in the MS Tele- Coach. Patients receive thrice weekly coaching advice to enhance their physical activity (gradually increasing by 5 % versus baseline, every 3 weeks) compared to their baseline physical activity. Clinical status of the patient and 5 outcome measures (FSMC, Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, Short Form-36, Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale and Illness Perception Scale) are assessed at all visits. Results: Data collection analyses is still ongoing. Thus, first results (n = 20) will be presented during the ECTRIMS meeting in Copenhagen. The primary endpoint of the study is the change in FSMC at 12 weeks compared with baseline. This pilot study is powered to detect a clinically meaningful change on the total FSMC score, which is reached when a patient changes from fatigue category e.g. from being severely fatigued to moderately fatigued.

Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: University research laboratory. Participants: Community-residing persons with MS (N=268). Intervention: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Main outcome measures included the MSWS-12 and spatial and temporal gait parameters (walking speed, cadence, step length, step time, base of support [ie, the distance between 1 footfall and the line of progression of the opposing foot], and percentage of gait cycle spent in double support). Secondary outcomes included the timed 25-foot walk (T25FW), 6-minute walk (6MW), and Patient-Determined Disease Steps scale. Results: MSWS-12 scores were significantly correlated with walking speed (r=-.59), cadence (r=-.50), step length (r=-.53), step time (r=.46), base of support (r=.29), and percentage of the gait cycle spent in double support (r=.54). MSWS-12 scores further were significantly correlated with T25FW (r=.57) and 6MW (r=-.75) scores.

Then, the subjects were referred for completion self-report questionnaires (gait, perceived balance confidence, physical activity and fatigue), gait clinical trials, and 3D kinematic analysis. Results: MS patients showed more impairment of perceived fatigue, perceived of walking impact and perceived balance confidence, despite having no disability. Gait characteristics showed no differences when they were determined by clinical observation. The 3D kinematic analysis of gait showed slight but significant changes in ankle movement. Conclusion: MS patients with no clinical disability have discrete changes in gait that can be evidenced by perceived impact on walking and kinematic evaluation, mainly of ankle movement.

Analyses of the basic accelerometric parameters associated with a jerk analysis allowed us to differentiate between the population groups. We observed a significant reduction of acceleration parameters in neurological patients when compared with healthy subjects, with a reduction of the mean acceleration of 0.30 m/s(2) for ataxic and 0.64 m/s(2) for parkinsonian patients (t test, p < 0.01).

Spatiotemporal plots with color coding of pressure have greatly facilitated the analysis of esophageal peristalsis. Although suitable for the length of the esophagus, the solid-state catheter is insufficient for the study of longer segments of the gastrointestinal tract. A new technique with fiber-optic sensors has made it possible to construct catheters with 72-144 sensors. Studies of colonic motility have revealed that the most common motor pattern of the colon is a peristaltic contraction that travels 7-10 cm in the retrograde direction. Earlier studies using low-resolution manometry with 7-45 cm between sensors led us to erroneous conclusions regarding direction and frequency of contractions and they largely missed both antegrade and retrograde contractions traveling short distances.

According to accelerometer data, there was an inverse correlation between EDSS and average counts/day (rho = -0.61, p = 0.001) and steps/day (rho = -0.79, p < 0.0001). A clearly decrease in daily activity (average steps/ day mean±SD 1,658.67±1,314.13) was seen in severe patients(p < 0.0001 vs mild, p = 0.002 vs moderate). The remote assessment of 6-MWT by accelerometer (counts and steps) showed a good correlation with the conventional test (Inter-class correlation = 0.83, p < 0.0001). Conclusions: This study confirms the feasibility of TM for the assessment of MS patients by the combination of self-reported and multimedia data, not previously described. The information obtained by a remote 6-MWT with accelerometer could be useful to reflect patient's daily walking activity. However, more accurately monitoring by 1-week period only found differences in severe disable patients. The combination of TM and accelerometers provide valuable data to better characterize the disease and could help in monitoring changes due to the disease or by medical interventions.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458513502429","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13524585&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458513502429&atitle=Implementation+of+a+clinical+monitoring+programme+by+telemedicine+in+patients+with+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=19&issue=11&spage=360&epage=&aulast=Sola&aufirst=N.&auinit=N.&aufull=Sola+N.&coden=&isbn=&pages=360-&date=2013&auinit1=N&auinitm=","Embase"

The study also explores multiple metrics, using in-home gait sensing, to study a subject's ambulatory ability including gait mechanics, uncertainty in motion, and gait cadence. We then investigate the effects of these vests on a subject's ambulation by examining these metrics both before and after the vest is worn. While only four subjects were used, results are promising, showing a statistically significant and clinically significant change in many of these metrics as a result of the vest. The cases presented here concern two subjects, one with a """"tight"""" gait caused by Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, and the second with an excessively """"loose"""" gait due to Parkinson's disease.

Local Dynamic Stability (LDS), a non-linear gait stability index, has been advocated as an early indicator of risk for falls. With this longitudinal study over three weeks, we aimed to assess the responsiveness of Local Dynamic Stability to a rehabilitation program and to compare it to other measures. Eighteen patients (mean 54 years, median EDSS score: 5) participated. They were admitted to inpatient rehabilitation and received a three weeks individually tailored program. They performed a 3-minute walking test at the beginning and at the end of the stay, as well as pain, wellbeing, fatigue, and balance assessment. The Local Dynamic Stability was computed from the acceleration signals measured with a 3D-accelerometer. At the end of the rehabilitation process, patients reported reduced pain (Effect Size: -0.7), fatigue (ES:-0.6), and increased wellbeing (ES: 1.1). A small positive effect on static balance was observed (ES: 0.3). LDS was improved (ES: 0.6), and the effect was higher than walking speed improvement (ES: 0.4). The Local Dynamic Stability seemed responsive to assess rehabilitation effects in patients with multiple sclerosis.

On 6 occasions, each separated by 6 months, people (N=269) with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis completed assessments of symptoms, self-efficacy, walking impairment, disability, and physical activity. The participants wore an accelerometer for 7 days. The change in study variables over 6 time points was examined with unconditional latent growth curve modeling. The association among changes in study variables over time was examined using conditional latent growth curve modeling, and the associations were expressed as standardized path coefficients (β). There were significant linear changes in self-reported and objectively measured physical activity, self-efficacy, walking impairment, and disability over the 2.5-year period; there were no changes in fatigue, depression, and pain. The changes in self-reported and objective physical activity were associated with change in self-efficacy (β=.49 and β=.61, respectively), after controlling for other variables and confounders. The primary limitations of the study were the generalizability of results among those with progressive multiple sclerosis and inclusion of a single variable from social-cognitive theory.

It aims at achieving personalization, modularity and maximization of the user's direct involvement in assistive systems. To this, MUNDUS exploits any residual control of the end-user and can be adapted to the level of severity or to the progression of the disease allowing the user to voluntarily interact with the environment. MUNDUS target pathologies are high-level spinal cord injury (SCI) and neurodegenerative and genetic neuromuscular diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Friedreich ataxia, and multiple sclerosis (MS). The system can be alternatively driven by residual voluntary muscular activation, head/eye motion, and brain signals. MUNDUS modularly combines an antigravity lightweight and non-cumbersome exoskeleton, closed-loop controlled Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation for arm and hand motion, and potentially a motorized hand orthosis, for grasping interactive objects. Methods. The definition of the requirements and of the interaction tasks were designed by a focus group with experts and a questionnaire with 36 potential end-users.Five end-users (3 SCI and 2 MS) tested the system in the configuration suitable to their specific level of impairment. They performed two exemplary tasks: reaching different points in the working volume and drinking. Three experts evaluated over a 3-level score (from 0, unsuccessful, to 2, completely functional) the execution of each assisted sub-action. Results: The functionality of all modules has been successfully demonstrated. User's intention was detected with a 100% success. Averaging all subjects and tasks, the minimum evaluation score obtained was 1.13 ± 0.99 for the release of the handle during the drinking task, whilst all the other sub-actions achieved a mean value above 1.6. All users, but one, subjectively perceived the usefulness of the assistance and could easily control the system. Donning time ranged from 6 to 65 minutes, scaled on the configuration complexity. Conclusions: The MUNDUS platform provides functional assistance to daily life activities; the modules integration depends on the user's need, the functionality of the system have been demonstrated for all the possible configurations, and preliminary assessment of usability and acceptance is promising. © 2013 Pedrocchi et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Article","10.1186/1743-0003-10-66","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=17430003&id=doi:10.1186%2F1743-0003-10-66&atitle=MUNDUS+project%3A+MUltimodal+Neuroprosthesis+for+daily+Upper+limb+Support&stitle=J.+NeuroEng.+Rehabil.&title=Journal+of+NeuroEngineering+and+Rehabilitation&volume=10&issue=1&spage=&epage=&aulast=Pedrocchi&aufirst=Alessandra&auinit=A.&aufull=Pedrocchi+A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2013&auinit1=A&auinitm=","Embase"

Cyclic voltammetric (CV) and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopic (EIS) methods were employed in determination of the electrode responses and applicability. Gelatin-MBP and gelatin-TiO(2)-MBP electrodes were prepared by chemical immobilization of the substrates onto the platinium electrodes. The formal potentials of MBP confined on gelatin-MBP and gelatin-TiO(2)-MBP surfaces are estimated to be 195 and 205mV, respectively. Thus, a little more reversible electron transfer reaction occurs on the gelatin-TiO(2)-MBP immunosensor surface. The peak separations of MBP (150mV and 110mVs(-1) at 100mVs(-1)) and the asymmetric anodic and cathodic peak currents indicate that the electron transfer between Anti-MBP and gelatin-MBP/gelatin-TiO(2)-MBP immunosensor is quasireversible. Control samples containing a nonspecific human immunoglobulin G (hIgG) antibody were also studied, and calibration curves were obtained by subtraction of the responses for specific and nonspecific antibody-based sensors. Gelatin-MBP and gelatin-TiO(2)-MBP immunosensors have detection limit of 0.1528ngml(-1) and 0.1495ngml(-1) respectively. This immunosensor exhibits high sensitivity and low response times (58s for gelatin-MBP and 46s for gelatin-TiO(2)-MBP immunosensor).

However, current technology is still insufficient to elucidate the mechanisms of organ dysfunction as a prerequisite for developing new therapeutic strategies, since it renders only sparse information about the molecular basis of cellular response within tissues in health and disease. In the context of imaging, Förster resonant energy transfer (FRET) is one of the most adequate tools to probe molecular mechanisms of cell function. As a calibration-free technique, fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) is superior for quantifying FRET in vivo. Currently, its main limitation is the acquisition speed in the context of deep-tissue 3D and 4D imaging. Here we present a parallelized time-correlated single-photon counting point detector (p-TCSPC) (i) for dynamic single-beam scanning FLIM of large 3D areas on the range of hundreds of milliseconds relevant in the context of immune-induced pathologies as well as (ii) for ultrafast 2D FLIM in the range of tens of milliseconds, a scale relevant for cell physiology. We demonstrate its power in dynamic deep-tissue intravital imaging, as compared to multi-beam scanning time-gated FLIM suitable for fast data acquisition and compared to highly sensitive single-channel TCSPC adequate to detect low fluorescence signals. Using p-TCSPC, 256×256 pixel FLIM maps (300×300 μm(2)) are acquired within 468 ms while 131×131 pixel FLIM maps (75×75 μm(2)) can be acquired every 82 ms in 115 μm depth in the spinal cord of CerTN L15 mice.

It is unclear whether this is a primary consequence of the disease or whether it is secondary to low activity, decrease in outdoor activity, low vitamin D 25(OH)D (VITD) levels or other factors (medications). There is emerging evidence that low VITD levels and reduced physical activity (PA) may negatively affect BMD in MS. Elevated proinflammatory cytokines [i.e. IL-6, soluble tumor necrosis factor II (sTNFRII), and interleukin-10 (IL-10)] and increased cortisol levels also appear inversely related to BMD in persons without MS. METHODS: In this study, we examined the associations for VITD, PA, endogenous cortisol, and cytokines with BMD in MS patients. Measurements were made in 23 community dwelling adults volunteers with MS and 21 age-matched controls. The lumbar spine (L2-L4) and femoral neck BMD were measured with dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA, lunar prodigy) and physical activity was measured with accelerometers (average of 7 day recording). Vitamin D, cortisol, and cytokines (IL-6, sTNFRII and IL-10) were measured by RIA or EIA. Analyses were by unpaired t-tests and Pearson correlations. The results showed that MS subjects compared with controls had differences in PA (p<0.05), IL-6 (p=0.01), sTNFRII (p=0.001) and mean femoral neck BMD (p=0.04). No differences were noted in lumbar spine, VITD or cortisol. In our sample (N=23 MS), VITD levels were normal and not different from CN with most of the MS group reporting VITD supplementation. VITD levels did not correlate with BMD. Within the MS group alone, PA was correlated to femoral BMD (r=0.48, p=0.02) but not lumbar spine (r= -0.14, p=0.56). However, BMD was NOT significantly correlated with cortisol, sTNFRII, or IL-10. IL-6 was inversely correlated to PA within the MS group (r= -0.40, p=0.05). CONCLUSION: In patients with MS who are replete with VITD, Physical Activity is a major contributor to BMD of the femoral neck. IL-6 levels may be a factor in the total physical activity of MS patients. Furthermore, low BMD was measured in at least one site in 11 of 23 patients with MS (48 %) but in only three control subjects (14 %) indicating a need to monitor BMD in this rather young (mean age 41+9 years) patient population. The results also suggest that importance of promoting physical activity to improve BMD and decrease fracture risk in persons with MS.","Conference Abstract","10.1007/S00198-013-2327-4","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=0937941X&id=doi:10.1007%2Fs00198-013-2327-4&atitle=Physical+activity+and+biomarkers+of+bone+mineral+density+in+persons+with+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Osteoporosis+Int.&title=Osteoporosis+International&volume=24&issue=&spage=S428&epage=S429&aulast=Papanek&aufirst=Paula+E.&auinit=P.E.&aufull=Papanek+P.E.&coden=&isbn=&pages=S428-S429&date=2013&auinit1=P&auinitm=E","Embase"

Results Steps/day was significantly, moderately, and similarly associated with oral (r(s) =.45, p <.01) and written (r(s) =.51, p <.01) SDMT performance, but weakly associated with scores on the PASAT (r(s) =.23, p =.02). After controlling for age and disability status as covariates of IPS, the associations among steps/day and oral (pr(s) =.25, p =.02) and written (pr(s) =.29, p =.01) SDMT performance were attenuated, but statistically significant, whereas after controlling for age and disability status, the association between steps/day and PASAT performance was not statistically significant (pr(s) =.12, p =.34). Conclusions These results support inclusion of either oral or written administrations of the SDMT, rather than the PASAT, as measures of IPS in future physical activity interventions. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Having identified factors from the literature, patient interviews and focus groups, we are recruiting healthcare professionals (HCP) representing the multidisciplinary team. This Professionals' forumcollects data onHCP perceptions and practice, providing context for the patients' responses and face validity of the models assessed. We present our experience in developing methods to collect data from a national sample of HCP and provide data from the pilot on physical influences on QOL in MS and MND. Methods: Response rates are maximized by recruiting professionals using a multiplier effect, with an ethics approved letter of invitation sent out by trial centres (N = 32) and professional organizations (e.g. College of Occupational Therapy) to HCP. Recruiting centres are located across the UK, each with a “champion” to act as local facilitator. Consent and data collection are via a secure web portal accessible via smartphone, tablet or computer. Each questionnaire is piloted to ensure content offers strong professional interest and can be completed within a few minutes without recourse to additional data. Summaries remind people of the importance of the study and update them about progress online and by email. In the pilot,HCP rated the anticipated effect of physical factors on QOL on a 6-point Likert scale. Results: HCP working in MS (N = 9) and MND (N = 8) from 8 professional groups scored 18 and 15 factors respectively. MS HCP did not endorse some factors proposed by the literature, namely numbness, dysaesthesia and vasomotor symptoms. Mobility was rated as vital to QOL by doctors and specialist nurses, but only as moderately influential by other HCP. MND HCP scored breathing problems and upper limb weakness as most influential on QOL. In the qualitative phase, MND patients identified fatigue and spasticity as significant influences. In contrast, HCP felt that fatigue, spasticity, bladder, bowel and sexual function were less important to QOL. Conclusion: This work utilised novel recruitment and electronic data collection techniques, seeking to maximize HCP participation. The pilot demonstrates that HCP perceptions of QOL vary between disciplines, and also differ from patients. Wider HCP participation using these methods will explore these disparities and strengthen the face validity of themodel.","Conference Abstract","10.1007/S00415-013-6924-0","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=03405354&id=doi:10.1007%2Fs00415-013-6924-0&atitle=Professionals%27+opinions+on+the+physical+factors+affecting+quality+of+life+in+multiple+sclerosis+and+motor+neurone+disease%3A+Pilot+work+from+the+Trajectories+of+Outcomes+in+Neurological+Conditions+study&stitle=J.+Neurol.&title=Journal+of+Neurology&volume=260&issue=&spage=S26&epage=&aulast=O%27Sullivan&aufirst=B.&auinit=B.&aufull=O%27Sullivan+B.&coden=&isbn=&pages=S26-&date=2013&auinit1=B&auinitm=","Embase"
"583","Carpinella I., Cattaneo D., Bertoni R., Ferrarin M.","Quantitative analysis of upper limb motor function in subjects with multiple sclerosis through instrumented “arat”","Gait and Posture",2013,"Introduction: Nearly 75% of subjects with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) experience upper limb dysfunction, mainly related to asthenia, tremor and coordination deficit [1]. In clinical practice, arm mobility is usually evaluated through functional tests, consisting of different tasks executed by the patient and rated by the examiner on a n-point ordinal scale. Although widely used, these clinical evaluations suffer from the following limitations: (1) high examiner-dependency, (2) limited sensitivity, (3) little detailed assessment of the executed motor task. Given the high variability of the MS symptoms, there is a need to reduce these limitations by developing new easy-to-use measurement tools which can provide more objective and detailed evaluations of upper limb function, necessary for the definition of personalized rehabilitation treatments. Following these considerations, aim of the present study was the development and the application of a quantitative method for the characterization of upper limb function in a group of MS subjects, through one inertial measurement unit (IMU). Methods: Fourteen MS patients (MS) and 12 healthy controls (CO) were tested through the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) [2], a clinical test that evaluates upper limb function. It consists of 19 tasks organized in 4 sections: Grasp, Grip, Pinch, and Gross. Each item is examiner-rated by a 4-point scale, with higher values indicating better performance. The test was executed with one IMU (containing a 3D accelerometer and a 3D gyroscope) mounted on the forearm of the most affected side of the patients at wrist level. Signals from gyros were low-pass filtered at 2.5 Hz and the norm of the angular rate was computed and processed to extract the duration of each task and the durations of task sub-movements (reaching, manipulation, transport, release and return). To quantify the smoothness of each movement, jerk index (JI) was calculated as the logarithm of the jerk (norm of the first time derivative of the acceleration), normalized with respect to the mean acceleration and the movement duration. To analyze the deviation from normative data, Z-score was calculated for each variable x as [(x-mean CO)/sd CO]. After ARAT, tremor was assessed through Fahn Tremor Rating Scale(FTRS) [3]. Results: Data extracted from IMU showed that all ARAT tasks executed by MS patients were significantly slower (duration: +70%, p < 0.001) and more jerky (JI: +16%, p < 0.01) with respect to controls. Moreover, all movement sub-phases (reaching, manipulation, transport, release and return) were significantly prolonged and less smooth with respect to control subjects. The two most affected sub-movements were manipulation and release, which revealed a duration increase greater than 400% and 200%, respectively, and a jerk increase greater than 120% and 40%. Pinch items showed the greatest anomalies. Analysis of the deviations from normative data showed that both Z-scores related to mean duration and to mean jerk index were significantly correlated with ARAT score and were able to discriminate between different levels of impairment. Moreover Z-score related to jerk index was significantly correlated with the level of tremor, measured through FTRS. Discussion: Analysis of data acquired through one IMU during the execution of ARAT showed that the extracted parameters were able to discriminate between control and MS subjects. In particular, MS patients executed all ARAT tasks more slowly and less smoothly with respect to controls. Greatest anomalies were found in manipulation and release of small objects (Pinch section) which required highest levels of coordination and control of fingers and arm. Even though caution must be taken given the small sample size, the significant correlation between the quantitative parameters and the clinical scores (i.e. ARAT and FTRS) suggested that this method is able (1) to discriminate between different level of upper limb impairment (i.e. mild, moderate, severe) and (2) to obtain an indication of tremor level during the execution of functional tasks similar to those typical of daily living. These preliminary results suggest that using one IMU during the execution of ARAT could be a quick and easy-to-use tool for a more quantitative and detailed characterization of the upper limb impairment of MS subjects.","Conference Abstract","10.1016/J.GAITPOST.2012.12.048","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=09666362&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.gaitpost.2012.12.048&atitle=Quantitative+analysis+of+upper+limb+motor+function+in+subjects+with+multiple+sclerosis+through+instrumented+%E2%80%9Carat%E2%80%9D&stitle=Gait+Posture&title=Gait+and+Posture&volume=37&issue=&spage=S21&epage=&aulast=Carpinella&aufirst=I.&auinit=I.&aufull=Carpinella+I.&coden=&isbn=&pages=S21-&date=2013&auinit1=I&auinitm=","Embase"

Based on the phase III data a relevant response occurs in about one third of the patients measured by the Timed 25 Foot Walk (T25FW) within 2 weeks. The impact on real life mobility has not been analysed. Mobile accelerometry offers the opportunity to assess different walking parameters as walking speed, numbers of step, distances or overall activity continuously in the patients' usual environment. Objective: To investigate short-term treatment response criteria with mobile accelerometry in pwMS starting fampidrine treatment. Methods: pwMS from the Hamburg outpatient clinic with an EDSS 4-7 performed short clinical walking tests and EDSS at week 0, 2 and 4. Mobile accelerometry was performed over the whole 4 weeks. Fampidrine treatment was started at week 2. Mean walking speed, mean walking speed in sequences of more than 50 steps (SR50), numbers of step per hour, distances per day, maximum walking distance without interruption (maxdist) per day, overall daily activity (activity temperature, AT) were extracted from raw accelerometry data for baseline (week 1 & 2) as well as for treatment (week 3 & 4) and used for a cluster analysis to separate responders and non-responders. Different parameter sets were compared to define response criteria. Results: We recruited 28 pwMS (60.7 % female) with a mean EDSS of 5.1 (sd 0.9) and a mean age of 49.1 (sd 8.6). The first parameter set consisted of % change in distance, % change in maxdist, % change in SR50, % change in steps/h, % change in AT and absolute change in walking speed. A reduced second parameter set with distance, steps/h, AT and walking speed showed a better clustering in two groups. Due to low discriminant abilities, AT was excluded from further analyses. Next, we defined two response criteria: 1. Change of distance ≥5% & change of speed > 0 or change of speed > 0 & change of steps ≥ 10%, 2. Change of distance ≥5% & change of speed > 0. Fisher's exact test of the contingency table showed a high similarity between the two definitions (p < 0.001). Responders had mean T25FW walking speed increase of 2.8 m/s, non-responders of 0.5 m/s. Conclusion: With only two parameters from mobile accelerometry (increase of mean distance per day >5% and change of mean walking speed >0) fampidrine responders could be separate from non-responders in their real life walking performance.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458513502429","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13524585&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458513502429&atitle=Real-life+mobility-response+criteria+in+patients+with+multiple+sclerosis+starting+fampidrine+treatment&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=19&issue=11&spage=502&epage=503&aulast=Stellmann&aufirst=J.-P.&auinit=J.-P.&aufull=Stellmann+J.-P.&coden=&isbn=&pages=502-503&date=2013&auinit1=J&auinitm=-P","Embase"

Using a microarray-based bioassay, we previously reported that sera of recent-onset type 1 diabetes (RO T1D) patients induce a partially interleukin (IL)-1 -dependent, proinflammatory transcriptional signature in freshly drawn peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). This signature is evident years prior to onset and precedes development of auto-antibodies. Here we evaluate the assays disease-specificity through examination of serum signatures in patients with RO T1D (n=47), bacterial pneumonia (n=10), H1N1 influenza (n=5), cystic fibrosis possessing pulmonary Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization (CF, n=20), Crohn's disease (CD, n=19), and multiple sclerosis (MS, n=10) using an optimized protocol that reduces inter-assay variability by employing cryopreserved PBMC of a single representative donor. Relative to unrelated healthy controls (n=44), sera of these disorders significantly regulated many transcripts in a manner opposite that of RO T1D, including the many IL-1 induced genes of the RO T1D signature. The H1N1 signature reflected an anti-viral response, possessing IFN-regulated genes, while the CD signature was characteristic of TNF-α -dependent transcription. The signatures associated with CF, pneumonia, H1N1, MS, and CD each reflected immunological activation, yet were distinct from one another and negatively correlated with that of RO T1D (Pearson's correlation coefficients: -0.72, -0.47, -0.42, -0.17, and -0.33 respectively). These studies show the capacity of cells to serve as disease-specific biosensors, capable of sensitively and comprehensively capturing the plasticity of the immune system and differentiating the diverse range of inflammatory processes that underlie human disease.","Conference Abstract","10.2337/DB13-1678-1742","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=00121797&id=doi:10.2337%2Fdb13-1678-1742&atitle=Serum+induced+signatures+as+a+disease-specific+biomarker+of+T1D&stitle=Diabetes&title=Diabetes&volume=62&issue=&spage=A447&epage=&aulast=Kashmiri&aufirst=Himala&auinit=H.&aufull=Kashmiri+H.&coden=&isbn=&pages=A447-&date=2013&auinit1=H&auinitm=","Embase"

One consequence of this disease is the emergence of enhanced tremor. This study was designed to (1) compare the tremor responses of persons with MS to that of healthy adults and to (2) examine the impact of whole body position (i.e., seated/standing) on tremor. Bilateral postural tremor was recorded using accelerometers attached to each index finger. Results revealed some similarity of tremor between groups in regard to the principal features (e.g., presence of peaks in similar frequency ranges). However, significant differences were observed with tremor for the MS persons being of greater amplitude, more regular (lower ApEn) and more strongly coupled across limbs compared to the elderly. The effects of body position were consistent across all subjects, with tremor increasing significantly from sitting-to-standing. However, the tremor increase for the MS group was greater than the elderly. Overall, the tremor for MS group was negatively affected by both this disease process and the nature of the task being performed. This latter result indicates that tremor does not simply reflect the feed-forward output of the neuromotor system but that it is influenced by the task constraints. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Many clinical measures of neurological performance are subjective and provide only a cursory summary of performance. Alternatively, biomechanical approaches are expensive and impractical. Objectives: 1) Use iOS to develop the iPad MSPT App to quantify UE and LE function and LCVA; 2) Utilize biomechanical algorithms to quantify MS performance. Methods: 61 controls (age 18-25) completed the LE module while 15 MS patients (age 52.5 ± 6.3 years) completed the UE and LCVA modules. 3D accelerometer and gyroscope data are sampled at 100Hz in the LE module. LE performance (balance and gait) was measured during the Sensory Organization Test (SOT) with the iPad affixed at the sacral level and timed 25-foot walk (T25-FW). For the UE module, position data was sampled from the capacitive touchscreen at 60Hz during task performance. A template with 9 holes similar to 9-Hole Peg Test (9HPT) was placed over the screen. Pin placement was logged and performance was compared to traditional 9HPT across two sessions. The Low Contrast Visual Acuity (LCVA) module utilized the Retina display to present letters at 3 contrast levels (100, 2.5 and 1.5%) similar to Low Contrast Sloan Letter Chart (LCSLC). Results: MSPT App LE outcomes showed a 0.90 correlation with SOT biomechanical measures and a correlation of 0.96 for T25-FW between stopwatch and MSPT App measurement. The correlation between the MSPT UE test and 9HPT was 0.94. In test-retest analysis, MS performance on the MSPT UE test was more consistent than the traditional 9HPT with concordance correlations of 0.92 and 0.68 respectively. The LCVA module performance had correlations ranging from 0.86 to 0.90 relative to LCSLC. Conclusions: The accelerometer and gyroscope provide a measure of LE function comparable to a biomechanical test of MS balance. The precision of the touchscreen and consistency in processing temporal variables during the MSPT UE test produced a test with greater repeatability than technician-led measures. The iPad's Retina display provides a consistent and reliable measure of LCVA. Collectively, these data indicate that with careful iOS programming the iPad can be a portable and affordable data collection tool that yields reliable and quantitative measures of MS motor and visual function.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458513502429","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13524585&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458513502429&atitle=The+multiple+sclerosis+performance+test+%28MSPT%29+App%3A+An+objective+and+quantitative+approach+to+the+evaluation+of+multiple+sclerosis+patients&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=19&issue=11&spage=358&epage=359&aulast=Alberts&aufirst=J.&auinit=J.&aufull=Alberts+J.&coden=&isbn=&pages=358-359&date=2013&auinit1=J&auinitm=","Embase"

Methods: The iPad3 served as a platform for development of the MSPT App. Software was written to capture the movements of patients while interacting with the screen. Data from the onboard accelerometer and gyroscope was used to quantify balance and gait. After β-testing and interviews with 7 MS patients and 5 Healthy Controls (HCs), final adjustments were made to the test programming, administration, and iPad-based patient instructions. Research subjects were recruited from the Mellen Center to determine correlation with technician-based testing, and ability to distinguish MS from HCs. Results: To date, 15 MS subjects (age 52.5 ± 6.3 years, 60% women, disease duration 15.3 ± 9.2 years, 66% relapsing MS), and 4 HCs controls (age 36.5 ± 16.8 years, 50% women) participated in cross-sectional validation of the MSPT. Test-retest reproducibility for iPad-based testing was excellent (Concordance Correlation Coefficients 0.81-0.99) as was agreement between iPad and technician-administered tests (Pearson CC 0.74 and 0.97). 25FW, 9HPT, and LCVA scores were worse for MS patients compared with HCs for iPad and technician-administered testing. iPad-administered processing speed test scores were worse for the MS group, while technician-administered SDMT scores were not. Conclusions: iPad-administered performance scores were highly reproducible, correlated with technician-administered scores, and distinguished MS from HCs as well or better than technicianadministered testing. The MSPT is a potentially transformative approach for collecting MS disability outcome data for patient care and research. Because the testing is computer-based, test performance can be analyzed in traditional or novel ways. Data can be directly entered into research or clinical databases.

Each subject received an Android HTC Sensation 4G smartphone. During the 1-year study, subjects accessed the study application daily to complete a quasi-randomly assigned test. Data: 43 cohabitating subject pairs fulfilled entrance criteria (age 18-55 years). One member of the pair had a diagnosis of MS (McDonald criteria), and the other member was free of MS. Among MS subjects, 75% were female. 40% of non-MS cohabitants were female. The median age was 34.5 (range 21-52) in MS subjects and 38 (range 18-55) in non-MS cohabitants. Overall, there is at least an 87.5% patient retention rate, with at least a 72% compliance rate. We report results of an interim analysis of data from 38 subject pairs that completed the Ishihara Color test every week for at least 4 months. This task requires the subject to view 9 separate pseudoisochromatic images and to type in the number that is perceived. It is performed monocularly for each eye. Using a threshold of 89% accuracy for an individual's test performance, 81.3% of tests for MS patients (n = 38) and 93.7% of tests for non-MS cohabitants (n = 38) were performed accurately. Nine MS subjects had color vision deficits (< 89% accuracy) in one or both eyes. In these affected eyes (n = 13), the mean accuracy was 54% (SD±33.43), and the accuracy in their non-MS cohabitants was 99% (SD±1.46). Comparison of color vision test performance to results from the Impact of Visual Impairment Scale demonstrated a modest correlation between color vision deficits and perceived visual ability, although this preliminary analysis is limited by a small sample size. Conclusions: Using a smartphone application platform, we captured high-frequency data on a diverse battery of assessments from MS patients. Most subjects remained engaged in the study despite the requirement of completing daily tasks. Analysis of Ishihara color test data identified eyes with poor color performance and found that those eyes demonstrated greater variance in test performance. These data illustrate the potential of smartphone- based applications for (1) gathering clinically relevant data in subjects' natural setting and (2) capturing longitudinal data that may be sensitive to incremental, clinically meaningful functional changes.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458513502429","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13524585&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458513502429&atitle=Towards+the+characterization+of+neurovisual+function+in+multiple+sclerosis+using+a+smartphone+platform&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=19&issue=11&spage=500&epage=&aulast=De+Jager&aufirst=P.&auinit=P.&aufull=De+Jager+P.&coden=&isbn=&pages=500-&date=2013&auinit1=P&auinitm=","Embase"

Upper limb impairment has an impact on the ability to perform activities of daily living efficiently and independently. Different intervention strategies targeting the upper limb are effective in improving impairment on function level [2,3]. Surprisingly, it is not known whether and to which extent an improvement at function level also translates into proportional positive effects on activity and participation level. Furthermore, it is unclear which outcome measures need to be used to assess upper limb function in MS. Methods.- This presentation will provide more insight into upper limb function in MS and will address the following issues: discussing which outcome measures can be used to assess upper limb function in MS, including clinical tests and questionnaires; identifying the relationship between outcome measures on the different ICF levels; - addressing the use of technology for assessment and upper limb rehabilitation in MS. Results and discussion.- This presentation incorporates an overview of findings from recent literature and experience from our research group and affiliated clinical centres specialized in MS [4]. Outcome measures like the Nine Hole Peg Test, Action Research Arm test, ABILHAND, Motor Activity Log, MAM- 36 and Accelerometry will be discussed during this presentation. A classification of outcome measures will be given which would be informative for the selection of outcome measures in future clinical trials. Results of studies including technology as an assessment tool or as rehabilitation strategies will be presented.","Conference Abstract","10.1016/J.REHAB.2013.07.921","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=18770657&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.rehab.2013.07.921&atitle=Upper+limb+function+in+patients+with+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Ann.+Phys.+Rehabil.+Med.&title=Annals+of+Physical+and+Rehabilitation+Medicine&volume=56&issue=&spage=e358&epage=e359&aulast=Lamers&aufirst=I.&auinit=I.&aufull=Lamers+I.&coden=&isbn=&pages=e358-e359&date=2013&auinit1=I&auinitm=","Embase"

To date, there is limited evidence regarding the validity of PDDS scores, despite its sound conceptual development and broad inclusion in MS research. This study examined the validity of the PDDS based on (1) the association with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores and (2) the pattern of associations between PDDS and EDSS scores with Functional System (FS) scores as well as ambulatory and other outcomes.Methods: 96 persons with MS provided demographic/clinical information, completed the PDDS and other PROs including the Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale-12 (MSWS-12), and underwent a neurological examination for generating FS and EDSS scores. Participants completed assessments of cognition, ambulation including the 6-minute walk (6 MW), and wore an accelerometer during waking hours over seven days.Results: There was a strong correlation between EDSS and PDDS scores (ρ = .783). PDDS and EDSS scores were strongly correlated with Pyramidal (ρ = .578 & ρ = .647, respectively) and Cerebellar (ρ = .501 & ρ = .528, respectively) FS scores as well as 6 MW distance (ρ = .704 & ρ = .805, respectively), MSWS-12 scores (ρ = .801 & ρ = .729, respectively), and accelerometer steps/day (ρ = -.740 & ρ = -.717, respectively).Conclusion: This study provides novel evidence supporting the PDDS as valid PRO of disability in MS. © 2013 Learmonth et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Article","10.1186/1471-2377-13-37","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14712377&id=doi:10.1186%2F1471-2377-13-37&atitle=Validation+of+patient+determined+disease+steps+%28PDDS%29+scale+scores+in+persons+with+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=BMC+Neurol.&title=BMC+Neurology&volume=13&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Learmonth&aufirst=Yvonne+C.&auinit=Y.C.&aufull=Learmonth+Y.C.&coden=BNMEC&isbn=&pages=-&date=2013&auinit1=Y&auinitm=C","Embase"

Objectives: We piloted a multi-dimensional patient-friendly smartphone (SP) longitudinal MS data collection platform. Methods: 37 pairs (1 MS patient and 1 cohabitant (CH)) were recruited at the Partners MS Center. Patients were aged 18-55 years and met McDonald criteria. The Android HTC Sensation 4G smartphone was used to deploy a custom application suite consisting of 20 tests capturing subject performance (color vision, attention, dexterity and cognition) and patient-reported outcomes (PROs). During the 1-year study, subjects were prompted to complete a quasi-randomly assigned test every day. Results: A total of 16 out of 37 pairs completed the entire study. Dropout was highest in the first 19 weeks, during which 15 pairs dropped out. Importantly, low initial scores on the SF-36 Mental Component Scale (P=0.04) and the Impact of Visual Impairment Scale (P=0.007), were associated with dropout in MS subjects. Performance on individual measures fluctuated over time. However, the mean of a performance measure over time provides a much more robust assessment on an individual's performance than any single cross-sectional measure. This is illustrated by the increased significance in correlation between pairs of measures: for example, we see a strong and expected correlation between SF-36 Physical Component Scale and MOS Pain Effects Scale scores at baseline (p=4 x 10-3) and on average (p=7 x 10-6). A learning curve was identified for most performance scores: after initial trials, scores improved and variance narrowed. Using spline models, scores for most tests stabilized after 10 trials in MS subjects and 5 trials in the cohabitants. Some MS subjects had a learning curve similar to CH subjects but the mean learning period was longer in MS subjects than in CHs in all performance tests. Conclusions: 43% of MS subjects tolerated daily tasks for 1 year and performed a variety of tasks on a smartphone. The smartphone platform was effective in gathering data at high frequency in the field. Novel phenotypes such as the inflection point in the practice effect were derived from these data. Clinical validation of these tests is necessary to establish clinical relevance. Future directions include enhanced and more frequent individual estimates of disease course to monitor disease course in large-scale studies.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458514547848","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13524585&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458514547848&atitle=A+1-year+smartphone+data+collection+study+for+MS%3A+Feasibility+and+utility+of+frequent+sampling+of+patient+performance+in+a+natural+setting&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=20&issue=1&spage=505&epage=506&aulast=Bove&aufirst=R.&auinit=R.&aufull=Bove+R.&coden=&isbn=&pages=505-506&date=2014&auinit1=R&auinitm=","Embase"

Biacore™, a label-free biosensor, utilizes surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to detect biomolecular interactions in real-time.DESIGN/METHODS: MuSK was immobilized onto Biacore™ 3000 sensor chips and diluted sera sequentially injected over the surface. Assay conditions were optimized by studying the binding of 20 healthy control, 10 MuSK antibody-negative, and 10 MuSK antibody-positive sera (reference assay Prof. Angela Vincent, Oxford, UK). We used different MuSK immobilization densities: low (300RU), medium (1200RU), and high (4500RU). An initial screen on a high-density MuSK surface was performed on 120 sera, consisting of 73 AChR antibody-negative, 31 normal healthy control and 16 non-healthy control (multiple sclerosis patients). Intra- and inter-assay variations were determined by calculating % coefficient of variation (%CV).RESULTS: Using a cut-off of mean+3SD of 20 healthy controls on the high density MuSK surface (4500RU), all healthy control and Oxford-tested MuSK-negative samples tested negative, while all 10 Oxford-tested MuSK-positive samples tested positive. Similar results were obtained using the medium density surface (1200RU), however the sensitivity of the assay decreased with a lower surface density (300RU). The assay was found to be highly reproducible, with intra-assay %CVs <10% and inter-assay %CVs <15%. Of the 120 sera screened, 24/73 AChR antibody-negative sera tested positive for anti-MuSK antibodies, while all 16 MS and 31 healthy controls tested negative.CONCLUSIONS: We have developeda rapid Biacore™-based assay for detecting anti-MuSK antibodies, with the assay time for each sample being approximately 7min.

Novel cost-effective interventions are required over the lifetime of PwMS as healthcare professionals (HCP) are expected to do more with less resources. Smartphone use is widespread and growing (RedC 2012). Numerous studies advocate using smartphones as self-management tools. Interventions have improved diabetes self-management (Ramadas et al 2011), aided smoking cessation (Brendryen et al 2008) and increased physical activity (PA) in healthy people (Hurling et al 2007). However little is known about smartphone use for health purposes in PwMS. Aim: To determine acceptability and feasibility of smartphone use in healthcare for PwMS Method: An online questionnaire with open and closed questions was developed following a literature review and findings from a focus group study. MS Ireland and The MS Society UK advertised the study via research websites, e-newsletters and social media. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse closed questions. Content analysis was used for open questions. Results: There were 198 respondents. The majority were female (n=138, 70.1%) and mobilised without an aid (n=154 78%). The mean (SD) age was 42.78 (±10.29) years. Smartphone access was reported by 174 (91.1%). Respondents agreed that there are potential benefits of smartphones in healthcare including improved healthcare access (n=119, 64.33%), greater independence (n=124, 67.03%) and saving time (n=139, 75.55%). Reported concerns included reduced contact with HCP (n=66, 35.48%), data security (n=60, 32.26%) and accessibility option requirements (n=47, 25.54%). Most respondents would accept text-based interventions (n=166, 88.8%) and smartphone applications to monitor PA (n=152, 80.9%). Conclusion: This is the first study to profile smartphone use and acceptance for healthcare in PwMS. Smartphone use is extensive and frequent in this cohort of high functioning, middleaged females with MS. They were open to smartphone use in healthcare, reporting many potential benefits. PwMS should be consulted during the design of smartphone based interventions, as specific concerns were raised. Future studies should explore HCP attitudes towards smartphone use in healthcare and consider how this technology may be best implemented in practice.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458514533628","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13524585&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458514533628&atitle=A+study+exploring+acceptability+and+feasibility+of+smartphone+use+for+healthcare+purposes+in+people+with+multiple+sclerosis+%28PwMS%29&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=20&issue=7&spage=976&epage=&aulast=Griffin&aufirst=N.&auinit=N.&aufull=Griffin+N.&coden=&isbn=&pages=976-&date=2014&auinit1=N&auinitm=","Embase"

BACKGROUND: Diabetes and cardiovascular co-morbidities are associated with accelerated multiple sclerosis (MS) disease progression. Reduced mobility, sedentary lifestyle, and repeat steroid exposure are insulin resistance risk factors common in MS. DESIGN/METHODS: Recruitment ongoing for 50 subjects (25 each): age 18 -64, non-obese, fasting blood glucose (BG) < 126, and without diabetes mellitus. OGTT completed with BG measured at 30, 60, and 120 minutes. MS functional composite, 6-minute and 2-minute walks, and health and quality of life surveys collected. Community ambulation measured with 7-day accelerometer. RESULTS: Preliminary analysis of first 28 subjects (14 MS/14 controls) similar in age, gender & BMI. At all OGTT time points MS subjects demonstrate statistically higher mean BG levels; MS subjects 120-min BG compared to controls mean (25th, 75th), 114 (99, 132) vs. 93 (92, 103), p-value = 0.037. Within the MS cohort, time from MS-symptom onset was significantly correlated with 2-hr BG (Rho = 0.464, p-value = 0.01). There was statistically significant differences in total daily accelerometer counts, 6-minute and 2-minute test distance between MS and controls; however, there was no significant correlation between these measures and 120-min BG levels. Further analyses are ongoing. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary analyses demonstrate that compared with controls, MS subjects have higher BG level with OGTT at 30, 60, and 120 mins. While MS subjects have reduced measured distance on timed-walk test and in the community, this is not correlated to OGTT results. One interpretation is that subject's fitness level is not the explanation for OGTT findings, but rather may be MS disease specific. Notably, OGTT results did significantly correlate to time since MS-symptom onset. This work is in progress. Complete enrollment and data analysis will be ready for meeting presentation.","Conference Abstract",NA,"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=00283878&id=doi:&atitle=A+study+of+insulin+resistance+in+multiplesclerosis+subjects+and+healthy+controls&stitle=Neurology&title=Neurology&volume=82&issue=10&spage=&epage=&aulast=Yeamans&aufirst=Rebecca&auinit=R.&aufull=Yeamans+R.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2014&auinit1=R&auinitm=","Embase"

This requires development of a cut-point for interpreting the rate of accelerometer output based on its association with energy expenditure during physical activity. Objective The current study measured activity counts from a waist-worn accelerometer and energy expenditure based on indirect calorimetry during three speeds of over-ground walking for deriving cut-points for interpreting accelerometer output in persons with mild, moderate, and severe MS disability. Methods 54 participants with MS initially completed a neurological examination for generation of an EDSS score. Participants were then fitted with an ActiGraph model GT3X + accelerometer and a Cosmed portable metabolic system, and completed three, 6-minute walk (6 MW) tests that were interspersed with 10-15 min of rest. The first 6 MW was undertaken at a comfortable walking speed (CWS), and the two remaining 6 MW tests were undertaken above (faster walking speed) or below (slower walking speed) the participant's CWS in a counterbalanced order. Results The linear association between activity counts per minute and energy expenditure did not differ between persons with mild and moderate MS disability, but it was significantly different among persons with severe disability. This resulted in disability-specific cut-points for MVPA of 1980 and 1185 counts per minute for groups with mild/moderate disability and severe disability, respectively.

Methods Eighty four participants with MS, without ocular disease or high myopia underwent a neurological examination for Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scoring, followed by OCT. Participants then wore an accelerometer during the waking hours of a 7-day period to objectively measure physical activity as steps/day. Results Mean RNFL thickness for the sample was 91.46 μm (SD=15.0), and mean TMV was 6.61 mm(3) (SD=0.5). The mean score from the accelerometer was 4287 steps/day (SD=2563).

The current investigation examined and compared the accuracy of the StepWatch activity monitor and ActiGraph model GT3X+ accelerometer for capturing steps taken during various speeds of prolonged, over-ground ambulation in persons with MS who had mild, moderate, and severe disability. Methods: Sixty-three persons with MS underwent a neurological examination for generation of an EDSS score and undertook two trials of walking on the GAITRite electronic walkway. Participants were fitted with accelerometers, and undertook three modified six-minute walk (6MW) tests that were interspersed with 10-15 minutes of rest. The first 6MW was undertaken at a comfortable walking speed (CWS), and the two remaining 6MW tests were undertaken above (faster walking speed; FWS) or below (slower walking speed; SWS) the participant's CWS. The actual number of steps taken was counted through direct observation using hand-tally counters. Results: The StepWatch activity monitor (99.8%-99.9%) and ActiGraph model GT3X+ accelerometer (95.6%-97.4%) both demonstrated highly accurate measurement of steps taken under CWS and FWS conditions. The StepWatch had better accuracy (99.0%) than the ActiGraph (95.5%) in the overall sample under the SWS condition, and this was particularly apparent in those with severe disability (StepWatch: 95.7%; ActiGraph: 87.3%). The inaccuracy in measurement for the ActiGraph was associated with alterations of gait (e.g., slower gait velocity, shorter step length, wider base of support). Conclusions: This research will help inform the choice of accelerometer to be adopted in clinical trials of MS wherein the monitoring of free-living walking behavior is of particular value. © 2014 Sandroff et al.","Article","10.1371/JOURNAL.PONE.0093511","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=19326203&id=doi:10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0093511&atitle=Accuracy+of+StepWatch%E2%84%A2+and+ActiGraph+accelerometers+for+measuring+steps+taken+among+persons+with+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=PLoS+ONE&title=PLoS+ONE&volume=9&issue=4&spage=&epage=&aulast=Sandroff&aufirst=Brian+M.&auinit=B.M.&aufull=Sandroff+B.M.&coden=POLNC&isbn=&pages=-&date=2014&auinit1=B&auinitm=M","Embase"

Patient counseling programs (PCP) should not only help in the understanding of MS but also to stay adherent to a given therapy and follow medical recommendations. Objectives: To evaluate, whether an individualized PCP based on the statistical analysis of a patient survey to identify current adherence risk factors can improve adherence and provide an effective system to stay adherent. Methods: In an open-label survey, German MS patients completed an anonymous web-based questionnaire regarding adherence factors. 4000 patients were invited, 1883 participated. Statistical analysis consisted of contingency tables and Chi-Square test. In February 2014, the PCP based on these results for patients treated with dimethyl fumarate (DMF) including amongst others differentiated information for 3 patient subtypes and a smartphone application started. DMF patients which were not included in the PCP serve as controls. Results: Demographic parameters from the survey were comparable to the German MS-register. While 87% of these patients were currently treated with disease-modifying drugs, 35% stated to have problems with adherence. Demographic factors did not act as reliable parameter predicting adherence risk factors while experience with MS therapies did. There is a positive correlation with adherent behavior in patients having realistic expectations of therapeutic outcome, good self-management, and reliable information sources. As of April 2014, 1701 DMF patients registered in the PCP. Approximately 75% of patients had experience with at least one therapy while the rest was newly diagnosed in both cohorts. The primary reason for transitioning to DMF in both groups was sensed ineffectiveness of prior therapy. Approximately a third of patients in the PCP reported adverse events (AE). Flushing was the most common AE, so far. Close contact between PCP and patients lead to effective AE management and most of the symptoms could be handled and improved. To retain adherence individual intake procedures were defined and the application with a reminder function was distributed. Conclusions: Reduction of AEs and thereby initial adherence could be achieved by the individualized PCP. Qualitative and quantitative measurements of adverse effects reduction and adherence will show if this initial approach will also be useful for longterm adherence.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458514546077","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13524585&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458514546077&atitle=Adherence+project+with+German+MS-patients%3A+Can+an+approach+of+individualized+patient+counseling+improve+adherence%3F&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=20&issue=1&spage=203&epage=&aulast=M%C3%A4urer&aufirst=M.&auinit=M.&aufull=M%C3%A4urer+M.&coden=&isbn=&pages=203-&date=2014&auinit1=M&auinitm=","Embase"

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease that occurs due to loss of dopamine, a neurotransmitter and slow destruction of neurons. Brain area affected by progressive destruction of neurons is responsible for controlling movements, and patients with PD reveal rigid and uncontrollable gestures, postural instability, small handwriting and tremor. Commercial activity-promoting gaming systems such as the Nintendo Wii and Xbox Kinect can be used as tools for tremor, gait or other biomedical signals acquisitions. They also can aid for rehabilitation in clinical settings. This paper emphasizes the use of intelligent optical sensors or accelerometers in biomedical signal acquisition, and of the specific nonlinear dynamics parameters or fuzzy logic in Parkinson's disease tremor analysis. Nowadays, there is no screening test for early detection of PD. So, we investigated a method to predict PD, based on the image processing of the handwriting belonging to a candidate of PD. For classification and discrimination between healthy people and PD people we used Artificial Neural Networks (Radial Basis Function - RBF and Multilayer Perceptron - MLP) and an Adaptive NeuroFuzzy Classifier (ANFC). In general, the results may be expressed as a prognostic (risk degree to contact PD).","Article","10.4316/AECE.2014.01020","WOS:000332062300020","WoS"

The purpose of this study was to determine if body-worn sensors detected any decline in gait and balance measures in people with MS over time. Twenty-seven people with MS (13 mildly disabled, self-rated expanded disability status scale 0-3.5; 14 moderately disabled, SR-EDSS 4.0-5.5) who had normal walking speeds and 18 matched control subjects underwent gait and balance testing using body-worn sensors every 6 months for 18 months. While no parameter worsened over time, the moderately disabled MS cohort performed more poorly than the mildly disabled MS cohort who, in turn, was worse than control subjects for both objective and subjective walking and balance measures. Furthermore, the moderately disabled MS cohort demonstrated greater variation in between-visit performance than did the less disabled MS cohort or controls (Bonferroni-corrected p<. 0.05).

A Reliability and Comparison Study in Healthy Individuals and in Patients with Paresis of the Lower Extremities","PLOS ONE",2014,"Falls while walking are frequent in patients with muscular dysfunction resulting from neurological disorders. Falls induce injuries that may lead to deconditioning and disabilities, which further increase the risk of falling. Therefore, an early gait stability index would be useful to evaluate patients in order to prevent the occurrence of future falls. Derived from chaos theory, local dynamic stability (LDS), defined by the maximal Lyapunov exponent, assesses the sensitivity of a dynamic system to small perturbations. LDS has already been used for fall risk prediction in elderly people. The aim of the present study was to provide information to facilitate future researches regarding gait stability in patients with neurological gait disorders. The main objectives were 1) to evaluate the intra-session repeatability of LDS in patients and 2) to assess the discriminative power of LDS to differentiate between healthy individuals and neurological patients. Eighty-three patients with mild to moderate neurological disorders associated with paresis of the lower extremities and 40 healthy controls participated in the study. The participants performed 2x30 s walking wearing a 3D accelerometer attached to the lower back, from which 2x35 steps were extracted. LDS was defined as the average exponential rate of divergence among trajectories in a reconstructed state-space that reflected the gait dynamics. LDS assessed along the medio-lateral axis offered the highest repeatability and discriminative power. Intra-session repeatability (intraclass correlation coefficient between the two repetitions) in the patients was 0.89 and the smallest detectable difference was 16%. LDS was substantially lower in the patients than in the controls (33% relative difference, standardized effect size 2.3). LDS measured in short over-ground walking tests seems sufficiently reliable. LDS exhibits good discriminative power to differentiate fall-prone individuals and opens up the possibility of future clinical applications for better prediction of fall risk in neurological patients.","Article","10.1371/JOURNAL.PONE.0100550","WOS:000338276300089","WoS"

Persistent anti-natalizumab antibodies are associated with loss of treatment efficacy and increased infusion-related adverse events. Biacore™, a label-free biosensor, detects biomolecular interactions in real time using surface plasmon resonance technology.METHODS: Natalizumab was immobilized on a sensor chip surface and levels of antibodies binding to the surface were determined in diluted samples. We blindly analyzed 10 control samples of varying 12C4 monoclonal antibody concentrations (Biogen Idec), 22 untreated MS patient sera, two positive control sera, and normal healthy individuals (n=20), using mean+3SD of healthy controls as a cutoff for positivity. Additionally, serial samples (n=75) from 7 patients treated with natalizumab for up to 30 months were tested. All samples were also assayed with a modified bridging ELISA originally developed by Biogen Idec. We further confirmed antibody positivity by pre-incubating samples with excess natalizumab, prior to assaying.RESULTS: Eight of 10 Biogen 12C4 control samples (0.65 to 2.50μg/ml) were positive for anti-natalizumab antibodies and two (0μg/ml) were antibody-negative. Biacore™ binding responses and ELISA OD values correlated strongly (R2=0.99903 and R2=0.98037, respectively) with 12C4 concentrations. Furthermore, the untreated MS patient sera were all found to be antibody-negative by both assays. Among the serial samples, one patient was found to have anti-natalizumab antibodies peaking by month six and seroconverting to antibody negative by month 21. In antibody-positive sera, binding levels were decreased or completely abrogated in the presence of excess natalizumab.CONCLUSIONS: A rapid, sensitive, and specific assay has been developed to detect anti-natalizumab antibodies in human serum, and will be further used to investigate the affinity and IgG subclasses of these antibodies.","Conference Abstract",NA,"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=00283878&id=doi:&atitle=Detection+of+anti-natalizumab+antibodies+in+treated+multiple+sclerosis+patients+using+a+biacore%E2%84%A2+platform&stitle=Neurology&title=Neurology&volume=82&issue=10&spage=&epage=&aulast=Aziz&aufirst=Tariq&auinit=T.&aufull=Aziz+T.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2014&auinit1=T&auinitm=","Embase"

By comparison, very little is known about natural occurring change in physical activity over time. Such inquiry is important for identifying the rate, patterns, and predictors of change for the design and delivery of behavioral interventions in this population. The present study conducted latent growth modeling (LGM) and latent class growth analysis (LCGA) for understanding the rate, patterns, and predictors of change in physical activity over a 24-month period among persons with MS. Methods: On three occasions each separated by 12 months, persons (n = 269) with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) completed a battery of questionnaires that included assessment of physical activity behavior. Data were analyzed using Mplus 3.0. Results: The LGM indicated that a linear model provided a good fit to the data (chi(2) = 3.94, p = .05, CFI = .987, SRMR = .025), but the slope (M-s = 0.8) was nonsignificant (p > .05) and indicated no change in physical activity over time. LCGA identified a 2-class solution, and, based on the Lo-Mendell-Rubin likelihood ratio test, this model fit the data better than the 1-class solution. The 2-class solution consisted of low-active (similar to 80%) and high-active (similar to 20%) persons, but there was no change in physical activity over time per group. Sex and disability, but not age and disease duration, were predictors of being in the low active class. Conclusions: There was prevalent physical inactivity, but little interindividual and intraindividual change over 24 months in this cohort of persons with RRMS. Such results identify the importance of behavior interventions, perhaps early in the disease process wherein physical inactivity originates.","Article","10.1037/A0032700","WOS:000334574500003","WoS"

However, the real-time dynamics of beta-AR-mediated cAMP signaling in single live astrocytes and its effect on cell morphology have not been studied. We used the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based cAMP biosensor Epac1-camps to study time-dependent changes in [cAMP](i); morphological changes in primary rat astrocytes were monitored by real-time confocal microscopy. Stimulation of beta-AR by adrenaline, noradrenaline, and isoprenaline, a specific agonist of beta-AR, rapidly increased [cAMP](i) (similar to 15 s). The FRET signal response, mediated via beta-AR, was faster than in the presence of forskolin (twofold) and dibutyryl-cAMP (>35-fold), which directly activate adenylyl cyclase and Epac1-camps, respectively, likely due to slow entry of these agents into the cytosol. Oscillations in [cAMP](i) have not been recorded, indicating that cAMP-dependent processes operate in a slow time domain. Most Epac1-camps expressing astrocytes revealed a morphological change upon beta-AR activation and attained a stellate morphology within 1 h. The morphological changes exhibited a bell-shaped dependency on [cAMP](i). The 5-10% decrease in cell cross-sectional area and the 30-50% increase in cell perimeter are likely due to withdrawal of the cytoplasm to the perinuclear region and the appearance of protrusions on the surface of astrocytes. Because astrocyte processes ensheath neurons, beta-AR/cAMP-mediated morphological changes can modify the geometry of the extracellular space, affecting synaptic, neuronal, and astrocyte functions in health and disease.

Eighteen individuals with MS [divided into those who were independently ambulatory (n = 10) and those who were ambulatory with assistance (n = 8)] and 10 healthy controls performed a 6MW while recording spatiotemporal gait parameters using a pressure-sensitive walkway. Parameters recorded were walking velocity, cadence, step length and width, step time, percent of the gait cycle in double support, and variability of step length and width, step time, and double support. The ambulatory with assistance MS group had a significantly greater reduction in walking velocity (P = 0.000) over the course of the 6MW, which coincided with a significantly greater increase in step time and double support (P = 0.029) than in the other groups. Only the ambulatory with assistance MS group showed an increase in step-time variability and double-support variability during the 6MW (P's < 0.05). The novel results indicate that the reduction in velocity over prolonged walking occurs through a greater change in the temporal parameters of gait in persons with MS who require assistance while walking.

After the program, participants were significantly less fatigued, and the percentage of individuals with severe fatigue was 22% to 53% lower than before the program. In addition, aerobic capacity and knee flexion strength were significantly higher, and body fat was significantly lower after the program. Participants were able to perform physical exercise at the target training intensity, no adverse events were registered, and attendance (93%) and mean patient satisfaction (8.5 out of 10, range=7-10) were high. Limitations. No control group was used in the study. Conclusions. A rehabilitation program consisting of exercise training and physical activity counseling is well tolerated and seems promising in reducing fatigue and improving fitness among recipients of liver transplants.","Article","10.2522/PTJ.20130402","WOS:000336707500011","WoS"

Contemporary methods to assess the level of physical activity in PwMS are regular clinical observation. However, these methods either rely on high recall and accurate reporting from the patients (e.g. self-report questionnaires), or they are conducted during a particular clinical assessment with predefined activities. Therefore, the main aim of this pilot study was to develop an objective method to gather information about the real type and intensity of daily activities performed by PwMS in every-day living situations using an accelerometer. Furthermore, the accelerometer-derived measures are investigated regarding their potential for discriminating between different MS groups. Methods: Eleven PwMS that were able to walk independently (EDSS ≤ 5) were divided into two groups: mild disability (EDSS 1-2.5; n = 6) and moderate disability (EDSS 3 -5; n = 5). Participants made use of an activity monitor device attached to their waist during their normal daily activities over 4 measurements. Activity parameters were assessed and compared for the time of each participant's first measurement and follow-up measurement. Furthermore, differences between both subgroups, and the correlation of activity parameters with the clinical neurological variable (EDSS) were investigated. Results: Participants showed significant decline in step count (p = 0.008), maximum walking speed (p = 0.02) and physical activity intensity (p = 0.03) throughout the study period. Compared to the mild subgroup, moderate affected participant accumulated less number of steps (G1: 9214.33 ± 2439.11, G2: 5018.13 ± 2416.96; p < 0.005) and were slower (G1: 1.48 ± 0.19, G2: 1.12 ± 0.44; p = 0.03). Additionally, the EDSS correlated negatively with mean walking speed (r = - 0.71, p = 0.01) and steps count (r = - 0.54, p = 0.08). Conclusions: In this study, we used a portable activity monitoring sensor to gather information about everyday physical activity in PwMS at home. We showed that objective measurements using simple 3D accelerometers can track daily physical activity fluctuation. Furthermore, they track disability changes better than clinical measures. Thus, they can help to develop activity based treatments for PwMS. © 2014 Shammas et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Article","10.1186/1475-925X-13-10","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=1475925X&id=doi:10.1186%2F1475-925X-13-10&atitle=Home-based+system+for+physical+activity+monitoring+in+patients+with+multiple+sclerosis+%28Pilot+study%29&stitle=Biomed.+Eng.+Online&title=BioMedical+Engineering+Online&volume=13&issue=1&spage=&epage=&aulast=Shammas&aufirst=Layal&auinit=L.&aufull=Shammas+L.&coden=BEOIB&isbn=&pages=-&date=2014&auinit1=L&auinitm=","Embase"

However, the total amount of physical activity is just one descriptor of the postures, movements and activities people perform in daily life (physical behaviour, PB). So far, studies about MS and PB have not studied PB in detail. More detailed information about PB can be derived from accelerometers and have shown to be of added value in getting insight in the consequences of diseases and the effects of treatment. Aims: To determine how different components of PB are affected in fatigued patients with MS. Methods: Measurements were done with the ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometer for 7 days in 23 fatigued pwMS and in 23 age and gender matched healthy controls. Analysis was done with ActiLife, Excel and Matlab. Outcome measures were: amount of activity expressed in counts per day (CPD) and counts per minute (CPM); and duration of activity intensity categories (sedentary, light and moderate to vigorous (MVPA)). Outcomes were not only calculated over the whole day, but also over day periods (morning, afternoon, evening). Additionally, the distribution (Gini-index) of the duration of periods (bout length) of active (MVPA) and sedentary behaviour were calculated. Results: PwMS had significantly less CPD (mean=520000 vs 676000) and CPM (577 vs 712) than controls. PwMS spent a significant higher percentage of their time sedentary (63 vs 57%) and less time at the MVPA intensity (8 vs 10%) than controls. PwMS were significantly less physically active than controls in the morning (176000 vs 237000 CPD; 661 vs 861 CPM) and evening (128000 vs 192000 CPD; 467 vs 642 CPM). The pwMS spent significantly more time in long sedentary bouts (.50 vs .47) and in short active bouts than the controls (.32 vs .39). Conclusion: PwMS are less physically active, the detailed analysis showed more time is spend sedentary and less at MVPA intensity, and in the morning and evening they are less active. Their sedentary behaviour consists of more longer sedentary periods and the active behaviour of more shorter active periods. These insights can be used in behavioural change therapies, such as for example energy-management mainly given by occupational therapists in clinical practice.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458514533628","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13524585&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458514533628&atitle=How+does+MS+affect+physical+behaviour%3A+A+comparison+with+healthy+controls&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=20&issue=7&spage=970&epage=&aulast=Blikman&aufirst=L.J.M.&auinit=L.J.M.&aufull=Blikman+L.J.M.&coden=&isbn=&pages=970-&date=2014&auinit1=L&auinitm=J.M.","Embase"

Patients are at risk of becoming dependent and socially isolated. The use of robotic technology in a virtual reality context can be applied to enhance rehabilitation, intensity and volume. The current study aimed to investigate the efficacy of a robot-assisted training regime in a virtual learning environment, which can be used autonomously given that difficulty levels and support adapt according to the individual arm performance. Methods: Persons with MS (PwMS) and chronic stroke patients with low to moderate proximal muscle strength are eligible for participation in this single arm prospective cohort study. Included patients train the most impaired arm with the I-TRAVLE system, using the Haptic Master robot, during 8 consecutive weeks at a frequency of 5 training sessions of twice 30 minutes per two weeks. To avoid (general/motor) fatigue and training overload, training sessions are interspaced by at least half an hour. Arm function is evaluated 3 times at baseline, directly after training and at 3 months of follow-up. Selected outcome measures at different ICF levels are Motricity Index, Plate tapping task, Wolf Motor Function Test, active range of motion of the shoulder, ABILHAND, Manual Ability Measure, perceived fatigue and strength by means of a Visual Analogue Scale and accelerometry to determine actual performance. Furthermore, patients participated in a focus group, questioning about the subjective experience of their arm dysfunction and potential changes during training. Results: A first group of 3 women and 2 men with impaired arm function due to MS completed the training. Maximum and sustained anteflexion and abduction of the shoulder, and shoulder muscle strength improved in 3 out of 5 PwMS. Median perceived fatigue decreased from 3.6 (IQR 2.6-4.5) to 2.1 (IQR 1.2-2.2) while median perceived strength improved from 3.7 (IQR 3.7-4.7) to 7.7 (IQR 5.7-7.9) after training. Patients reported in the focus group on perception of arm function and whether expectations were met by the provided training. Improvements on motor control during sustained motor activities were reported. Conclusion: Recruitment and training of the study is still ongoing and data are being collected. More information will be provided after further analysis on a larger sample size (>15) and other outcome parameters.

The course of SCA1 is accompanied with progressive weight loss and amyotrophia - the causes for that remain, however, unclear. We tested the hypothesis that an imbalance between energy intake and expenditure contributes to weight loss in SCA1 patients. Anthropometric measures, energy intake (food records), and resting (calorimetry) and free-living (accelerometry) energy expenditure were determined in 10 patients with genetically proven SCA1 and 10 healthy controls closely matched for age, sex, and body composition. At rest, energy expenditure per kilogram fat-free mass was 22 % and fat oxidation rate 28 % higher in patients vs. controls indicating an increased catabolic state. Under free-living conditions, total energy expenditure and daily step counts were significantly lower in patients vs. controls. However, most patients were able to maintain energy intake and expenditure in a balanced state. Resting energy expenditure, fat oxidation, and activity energy expenditure per step count are higher, whereas 24-h total energy expenditure is lower in SCA1 patients vs. healthy controls. An altered autonomic nervous system activity, gait ataxia, and a decreased physical activity might contribute to this outcome. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media.","Article","10.1007/S12311-014-0555-6","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14734230&id=doi:10.1007%2Fs12311-014-0555-6&atitle=Increased+catabolic+state+in+spinocerebellar+ataxia+type+1+patients&stitle=Cerebellum&title=Cerebellum&volume=13&issue=4&spage=440&epage=446&aulast=M%C3%A4hler&aufirst=Anja&auinit=A.&aufull=M%C3%A4hler+A.&coden=CEREC&isbn=&pages=440-446&date=2014&auinit1=A&auinitm=","Embase"

Participants completed a battery of PRO questionnaires, and then wore an accelerometer for seven days at each data collection time point every six months for 2.5 years. Statistical analysis first defined Change Groups on the basis of the performance-based accelerometer scores, anchored to 0.5 standard deviation change; then change was defined on the basis of published and linked MIDs for the PROs.Results The performance-based (accelerometer) and PRO-based change distributions were stable over time. Raw scores among the accelerometer and PRO measures were associated with large effect sizes, and PRO change scores were associated with each other but not with accelerometer change scores.Conclusions These findings contradict a central assumption that may underlie clinical research studies: that a cross-sectional correlation implies that change in PROs will correspond with change in behavior/performance.

Objective We developed an innovative paradigm for investigation of DBS on human movement disorders. Temporary connection to the DBS electrode during implantable pulse generator (IPG) replacement permitted analysis of novel patterns of stimulation on motor symptoms, which could enhance efficacy and improve battery life. Materials and Methods Patients enrolled in this prospective, Institutional Review Board-approved study underwent IPG replacement using local (monitored) anesthesia. Following device explant, the DBS electrode was connected to an external, isolated electrical stimulator using a sterile adapter cable. Different temporal patterns of stimulation were delivered while quantifying upper-extremity tremor (tri-axial accelerometry) or bradykinesia (finger-tapping). Upon experiment completion, the new IPG was implanted. Results Among 159 IPG replacements from 2005 to 2011, 56 patients agreed to the research study (16 essential tremor [ET], 31 Parkinson's disease [PD], 5 mixed ET/PD tremor, 3 multiple sclerosis, 1 tremor/myoclonus). Surgical procedures were extended by 42 ± 8.2 min in 37 patients completing the study. Motor symptoms varied with stimulation pattern, with some patterns showing improved tremor or bradykinesia control. No postoperative infections or complications were observed in the 159 patients. Conclusion IPG replacement occurs when the DBS/brain interface is stable and patients demonstrate symptom reduction with known stimulation parameters. Conducting research at this time point avoids DBS implant issues, including temporary microlesion effects, fluctuating electrode impedances, and technical limitations of contemporary IPGs, providing advantageous conditions to conduct translational DBS research with minimal additional risk to research subjects. © 2013 International Neuromodulation Society.","Article","10.1111/NER.12123","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=15251403&id=doi:10.1111%2Fner.12123&atitle=Investigation+of+deep+brain+stimulation+mechanisms+during+implantable+pulse+generator+replacement+surgery&stitle=Neuromodulation&title=Neuromodulation&volume=17&issue=5&spage=419&epage=424&aulast=Swan&aufirst=Brandon+D.&auinit=B.D.&aufull=Swan+B.D.&coden=NROMF&isbn=&pages=419-424&date=2014&auinit1=B&auinitm=D","Embase"

Methods: A literature search was conducted looking at articles published between 2009 and 2014 that referenced electronic diaries of some description. Articles were pulled out that specifically referenced mobile or cellular phones. Results: 39 of out of 191 articles found specifically referenced mobile. The studies referenced were carried out on populations with an age range of 8 years up to 80 (mean 35.4; SD 16.6) and were split into 15 therapy areas including metabolic and genetic disorders, pain, weight management, sexual activity, respiratory, multiple sclerosis and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Population size ranged from 12 to 994 (mean 208.3; SD 269.2), and subjects reported for a minimum of 7 days (up to 6 reports per day) to a maximum of 2 years (mean 154.3 days; SD 170.6). Notably, 18 out of the 39 studies allowed the subjects to use their own mobile phone for the reporting and 19 articles referenced smartphones specifically. Conclusions: All concluded that mobile phones were suited to collect data from subjects. It was noted that the use of mobiles was acceptable as they are used them in everyday life and found to be convenient; the technology was also inexpensive to implement. The fact that 46.2% of the studies allowed the subjects to use their own mobile phones for the reporting emphasises the practicality of using mobile phones in patient reported outcomes. Although the mean age of all the studies was relatively low, the age range was very wide and researchers can be confident that older populations could use mobile phones to collect these data. The technical evolution of mobile technologies and ubiquitous nature show that this technology is a valid means to collect patient reported outcomes.","Conference Abstract","10.1016/J.JVAL.2014.08.1603","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=10983015&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.jval.2014.08.1603&atitle=Mobile+phone+use+in+patient+reported+outcomes-an+updated+literature+search&stitle=Value+Health&title=Value+in+Health&volume=17&issue=7&spage=A517&epage=&aulast=O%27Gorman&aufirst=H.&auinit=H.&aufull=O%27Gorman+H.&coden=&isbn=&pages=A517-&date=2014&auinit1=H&auinitm=","Embase"

Moreover, we demonstrate how parallel measurements with several biosensors can integrate these redox signals into a comprehensive characterization of mitochondrial function. This approach revealed that axonal mitochondria undergo spontaneous 'contractions' that are accompanied by reversible redox changes. These contractions are amplified by neuronal activity and acute or chronic neuronal insults. Multiparametric imaging reveals that contractions constitute respiratory chain-dependent episodes of depolarization coinciding with matrix alkalinization, followed by uncoupling. In contrast, permanent mitochondrial damage after spinal cord injury depends on calcium influx and mitochondrial permeability transition. Thus, our approach allows us to identify heterogeneity among physiological and pathological redox signals, correlate such signals to functional and structural organelle dynamics and dissect the underlying mechanisms.","Article","10.1038/NM.3520","WOS:000335710700029","WoS"

Measurements using a highly backdrivable wearable ankle robot combined with multi-input multi-output stochastic system identification methods enabled reliable characterization of ankle mechanical impedance in two degrees-of-freedom (DOFs) simultaneously, the sagittal and frontal planes. The characterization included important ankle properties unavailable from single DOF studies: coupling between DOFs and anisotropy as a function of frequency. Ankle impedance in joint coordinates showed responses largely consistent with a second-order system consisting of inertia, viscosity, and stiffness in both seated (knee flexed) and standing (knee straightened) postures. Stiffness in the sagittal plane was greater than in the frontal plane and furthermore, was greater when standing than when seated, most likely due to the stretch of bi-articular muscles (medial and lateral gastrocnemius). Very low off-diagonal partial coherences implied negligible coupling between dorsiflexion-plantarflexion and inversion-eversion. The directions of principal axes were tilted slightly counterclockwise from the original joint coordinates. The directional variation (anisotropy) of ankle impedance in the 2-D space formed by rotations in the sagittal and frontal planes exhibited a characteristic peanut shape, weak in inversion-eversion over a wide range of frequencies from the stiffness dominated region up to the inertia dominated region. Implications for the assessment of neurological and biomechanical impairments are discussed.","Article","10.1109/TNSRE.2014.2313838","WOS:000345573500002","WoS"
"521","Wicks P.","Patients as partners in clinical research - Does the Internet harm or help?","Multiple Sclerosis",2014,"Since the invention of the Mosaic web browser in 1993 the Internet has evolved to a consumer-focussed web of specialised services across digital devices, with great benefits for medical education, patient support groups, and advocacy. Yet the stereotype remains of the “Internet-savvy patient” who brings reams of printout with them to their clinical appointment to enquire after exotic therapies of dubious origin or discuss scientific theories without possessing the required technical skills. Fortunately, the advent of “Patient Powered Research Networks” (PPRNs) has advanced the field considerably in a short space of time. What was once a series of narrative anecdotes swapped between anonymous message boards and blogs is now a structured quantitative dataset supported by medical ontology, with capture of relevant demographics, treatments, symptoms, and validated outcomes that can be combined together to create datasets high enough in quality to be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. Furthermore because such PPRNs have the potential to display complex medical data in simple and customisable graphical interfaces, patients are increasingly understanding the context of their own condition over time (improving self-management) and understanding the challenges in conducting clinical research. When seeking to understand the burden of disease, developing new patient reported outcomes (PROs) or gaining feedback on clinical trial protocols, having rapid access to hundreds or even thousands of patients research participants can vastly accelerate research. A more intriguing possibility lies in the potential of truly participant-led research (PLR) where patients themselves conceive a scientific question, harness other patients like them in a PPRN, and with sufficient support from software and technical experts can conduct their own scientific research studies - examples include the lithium study in ALS. The widespread use of smartphones with integrated sensors such as accelerometers and GPS may provide new forms and channels of data with which to assess the efficacy of treatments, and it may well be that in bringing together the high touch clinical visit and the high tech digital device that patients themselves will be our most effective champions to advance the field. Such potential is not without its own challenges, including privacy concerns, data quality, ethical oversight, business models, and regulatory hurdles, but the benefits may be great.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458514546076","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13524585&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458514546076&atitle=Patients+as+partners+in+clinical+research+-+Does+the+Internet+harm+or+help%3F&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=20&issue=1&spage=65&epage=66&aulast=Wicks&aufirst=P.&auinit=P.&aufull=Wicks+P.&coden=&isbn=&pages=65-66&date=2014&auinit1=P&auinitm=","Embase"

Objective: We examined changes in depressive symptoms over a 30-month period and the demographic, clinical and behavioral predictors of such changes in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). Methods: 269 persons with RRMS completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and a demographic/clinical scale, Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ) and Patient Determined Disease Steps (PDDS) scale every 6 months over a 30-month period. Data were analyzed using latent class growth modeling (LCGM). Results: LCGM identified a two-class model for changes in HADS depression scores over time. Class 1 involved lower initial status (i.e. fewer depressive symptoms) and linear decreases in depressive symptoms over time (i.e. improving HADS scores), whereas Class 2 involved higher initial status (i.e. more depressive symptoms) and linear increases in depressive symptoms over time (i.e. worsening HADS scores).

Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: University medical center. Participants: Persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) (n=40) were compared with similar aged control subjects (n=20). There were 20 subjects with MS in the normal walking velocity group and 20 subjects with MS who had slow walking velocity based on a timed 25-foot walk (T25FW) of <5 seconds. Interventions: None. Main Outcome Measures: Postural response latency, sway variables, trunk motion variables. Results: We found that subjects with MS with both slow or normal walking velocities had significantly longer postural response latencies than the healthy control group. Postural response latency was not correlated with the T25FW. Postural response latency was significantly correlated with center of pressure sway variables during quiet standing (root mean square: rho=.334, P=.04; range: rho=.385, P=.017; mean velocity: rho=.337, P=.038; total sway area: rho=.393, P=.015).

Quantified self and other similar movements involving wearable systems have gained recent interest. However, it is unclear what the clinical impact of these enabling technologies is on human gait. The purpose of this review is to assess clinical applications of wearable sensing and feedback for human gait and to identify areas of future research. Four electronic databases were searched to find articles employing wearable sensing or feedback for movements of the foot, ankle, shank, thigh, hip, pelvis, and trunk during gait. We retrieved 76 articles that met the inclusion criteria and identified four common clinical applications: (1) identifying movement disorders, (2) assessing surgical outcomes, (3) improving walking stability, and (4) reducing joint loading. Characteristics of knee and trunk motion were the most frequent gait parameters for both wearable sensing and wearable feedback. Most articles performed testing on healthy subjects, and the most prevalent patient populations were osteoarthritis, vestibular loss, Parkinson's disease, and post-stroke hemiplegia. The most widely used wearable sensors were inertial measurement units (accelerometer and gyroscope packaged together) and goniometers. Haptic (touch) and auditory were the most common feedback sensations. This review highlights the current state of the literature and demonstrates substantial potential clinical benefits of wearable sensing and feedback.

ARAT provides a complete upper limb assessment, as it considers both proximal arm and hand, but suffers from subjectivity and poor sensitivity to mild impairment. In this study an instrumented ARAT is proposed to overcome these limitations and supplement the assessment of arm function in MS. Methods. ARAT was executed by 12 healthy volunteers and 21 MS subjects wearing a single inertial sensor on the wrist. Accelerometers and gyroscopes signals were used to calculate the duration of each task and its sub-phases (reaching, manipulation, transport, release and return). A jerk index was computed to quantify movement smoothness. For each parameter, z-scores were calculated to analyze the deviation from normative data. MS subjects were clinically assessed with ARAT score, Nine-Hole Peg test (9HPT) and Fahn Tremor Rating Scale (FTRS). Results: ARAT tasks executed by MS patients were significantly slower (duration increase: 70%) and less smooth (jerk increase: 16%) with respect to controls. These anomalies were mainly related to manipulation, transport and release sub-movements, with the former showing the greatest alterations. A statistically significant decrease in movement velocity and smoothness was also noticed in patients with normal ARAT score. Z-scores related to duration and jerk were strongly correlated with ARAT rating (r < -0.80, p < 0.001) and 9HPT (r < -0.75, p < 0.001) and were significantly different among MS sub-groups with different levels of arm impairments (p < 0.001). Moreover, Z-score related to manipulation-phase jerk was significantly correlated with the FTRS rating of intention tremor (r = 0.84, p < 0.001). Conclusions: The present study showed that the proposed method is able to discriminate between control and MS groups and to reveal subtle arm alterations not detectable from ARAT score. Validity was shown by high correlations between instrumental variables and clinical ratings. These results suggested that instrumented ARAT could be a valid quick and easy-to-use method for a sensitive quantification of arm function in MS. Inclusion of finger-mounted sensors could complement present findings and provide further indications about hand function in MS. © 2014 Carpinella et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Article","10.1186/1743-0003-11-67","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=17430003&id=doi:10.1186%2F1743-0003-11-67&atitle=Quantitative+assessment+of+upper+limb+motor+function+in+Multiple+Sclerosis+using+an+instrumented+Action+Research+Arm+Test&stitle=J.+NeuroEng.+Rehabil.&title=Journal+of+NeuroEngineering+and+Rehabilitation&volume=11&issue=1&spage=&epage=&aulast=Carpinella&aufirst=Ilaria&auinit=I.&aufull=Carpinella+I.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2014&auinit1=I&auinitm=","Embase"

Afterwards, recovery of muscle function was assessed by performing a fatiguing upper limb exercise test with subsequent recovery measures. Results Muscle recovery of the upper limb muscles was similar in both groups. Average activity counts were significantly lower in MS patients than in the control group. MS patients spent significantly more time being sedentary and less time on activities of moderate intensity compared with the control group. No significant correlation between PAL and recovery of muscle function was found in MS patients. Conclusions Recovery of upper limb muscle function following exercise is normal in MS patients.

This has motivated the search for variables that act as determinants of physical activity. Such variables are derived from theory and presumably represent targets of behavioral interventions for increasing physical activity.PURPOSE: This prospective, observational study examined variables from social cognitive theory as determinants of physical activity 6 weeks later in persons with RRMS.METHODS: Persons (N = 68) with RRMS initially completed a questionnaire battery that included measures of self-efficacy, physical, social, and self-evaluative outcome expectations, functional limitations as an impediment, social support as a facilitator, and goal setting for physical activity. The participants wore an accelerometer and completed a self-reported physical activity measure 6 weeks later. Data were analyzed using path analysis in Mplus 3.0.RESULTS: Self-efficacy (path coefficient = 0.19, p < 0.05), functional limitations (path coefficient = -0.33, p < 0.0001), and goal setting (path coefficient = 0.26, p < 0.01) had statistically significant direct effects on physical activity. Self-efficacy further had a statistically significant indirect effect on physical activity by way of functional limitations (path coefficient = 0.12, p < 0.05), but not by goal setting (path coefficient = 0.02, p = 0.66).

This principle is applied to several practical applications, such as food analysis where many important features (e.g. freshness) can be directly inferred from the analysis of volatile compounds.The same approach can also be applied to a human body where the volatile compounds, collected from the skin, the breath or in the headspace of fluids, might contain information that could be used to diagnose several kinds of diseases. In particular, breath is widely studied and many diseases can be potentially detected from breath analysis.The most fascinating property of breath analysis is the non-invasiveness of the sample collection. Solid-state sensors are considered the natural complement to breath analysis, matching the non-invasiveness with typical sensor features such as low-cost, easiness of use, portability, and the integration with the information networks. Sensors based breath analysis is then expected to dramatically extend the diagnostic capabilities enabling the screening of large populations for the early diagnosis of pathologies.In the last years there has been an increased attention to the development of sensors specifically aimed to this purpose. These investigations involve both specific sensors designed to detect individual compounds and non-specific sensors, operated in array configurations, aimed at clustering subjects according to their health conditions.

The objective of this work is the early detection of deterioration of the patient so that a physician can quickly intervene. Tests were carried out on a group of 8 persons with MS, and these results were compared with a control a group of 6 healthy participants. The results indicated a statistical difference in 7 of 40 general step features, with a minimum σ = 0.013 and a maximum σ = 0.029. These characteristics showed differences between first and fifth metatarsals for each group. It was concluded that these parameters can be used to evaluate gait degeneration in people with MS and that further information could be obtained from measurements with sensors to monitor activities such as bending and inertial sensors.","Conference Paper","10.3233/BME-141177","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=18783619&id=doi:10.3233%2FBME-141177&atitle=Technological+solution+for+determining+gait+parametersusing+pressure+sensors%3A+A+case+study+of+multiple+sclerosis+patients&stitle=Bio-Med.+Mater.+Eng.&title=Bio-Medical+Materials+and+Engineering&volume=24&issue=6&spage=3511&epage=3522&aulast=Villarejo&aufirst=Mar%C3%ADa+Viqueira&auinit=M.V.&aufull=Villarejo+M.V.&coden=BMENE&isbn=&pages=3511-3522&date=2014&auinit1=M&auinitm=V","Embase"

Work-up for tachycardia in the acute care hospital was negative for thyroid abnormalities, deep venous thrombi, hypovolemia and infection. Echocardiography was unremarkable and electrocardiography was notable for sinus tachycardia. Orthostatic vitals demonstrated increased heart rates with sitting and standing without change in blood pressure, consistent with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). Several therapy sessions were missed secondary to tachycardia greater than 80% of target maximal heart rate with minimal exertion. Given baseline hypotension, traditional medications such as beta blockers were contraindicated. Modafinil and sertraline were started instead. A digital wearable transdermal sensor was placed on the patient to measure minute information about heart rate, activity and position for three days after medication was started demonstrating improvements in baseline and exertional heart rates. Setting: Acute inpatient rehabilitation (AIR) hospital. Results or Clinical Course: Mean baseline heart rate prior to initiation of modafinil and sertraline was 114 bpm. Following medication therapy, the mean heart rates while lying down and not lying down were 73 and 98, respectively (P <.001), demonstrating significant improvement. A tendency for increased heart rates with upright activities was also noted, though significantly less than prior to medication initiation. The patient was successfully able to resume therapies. Discussion: This case demonstrates the importance of recognizing POTS in patients with MS. The incidence of POTS in MS is currently unknown with only a few case reports in the literature. None of these reports fully document accurate measuring of heart rates with activity. This case also demonstrates successful treatment with serotonin reuptake inhibitors (sertraline) and dopamine reuptake inhibitors (modafinil). Conclusions: Recognition and accurate heart rate tracking in MS patients with POTS improves management and maximizes therapy benefits in AIR.","Conference Abstract",NA,"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=19341482&id=doi:&atitle=Tracking+heart+rate+and+activity+to+manage+postural+orthostatic+tachycardia+syndrome+%28POTS%29+in+multiple+sclerosis%3A+A+case+report&stitle=PM+R&title=PM+and+R&volume=6&issue=9&spage=S244&epage=S245&aulast=Toledo&aufirst=Santiago+D.&auinit=S.D.&aufull=Toledo+S.D.&coden=&isbn=&pages=S244-S245&date=2014&auinit1=S&auinitm=D","Embase"

To evaluate physical activity interventions, validated assessment methods are needed. Due to the disease characteristics of multiple sclerosis (MS), this validation has to take place indication-specific. To date, no German physical activity questionnaire has been quality-tested for the use in pwMS. Aims: To test the content and construct validity of the German version (Wagner & Singer 2003) of the Baecke Questionnaire for habitual physical activity (Baecke et al. 1982) in pwMS. Methods: We included 44 pwMS (age 38.9 ±6.6; EDSS 2.8 ±0.8) in a cross-sectional study. Participants filled out the questionnaire, and the sport index, leisure time index and work index were calculated. We compared the indices with bicycle spiroergometry (absolute and relative aerobic capacity (VO(2) peak)) and accelerometry (week measurement with the actibelt®, variables: average steps/day). We then used Pearson's correlation coefficient to analyze the correlations between the indices of the questionnaire and the objective measurements. Results: The sample showed comparatively high levels of physical activity measured subjectively (sport index 2.8 ±0.9; leisure time index 3.5 ±0.8; work index 2.1 ±0.5) and objectively (7771 ±3490 steps/day). Compliance to accelerometry measurements was very high (weartime 877 ±73 minutes/day on 6.2 ±1.5 days/week). VO(2) peak was 26.1 ±6.0 ml/(kg∗min), corresponding to 92 ±21 percent of the normative value for the healthy population. The sport index showed a good correlation to total steps (r=0.533) and VO(2) peak (r=0.487) and the index's content validity was confirmed. The leisure time index had lower but still acceptable correlation to total steps (r=0.443) but there was no significant correlation to VO(2) peak. The content validity of the index is questionable since its items rather target transfer activities than leisure time activities. The work index showed no significant correlations to any objective measurement and content validity is questionable due to a high percentage of participants without jobs who still filled out the index. Conclusions: The use of the sport index can be recommended for pwMS. The leisure time index may cautiously be used, taking into consideration that it may rather be a “transfer index”. It is not recommended to use the work index or calculate the overall index for pwMS.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458514533628","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13524585&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458514533628&atitle=Validation+of+a+German+questionnaire+for+habitual+physical+activity+for+persons+with+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=20&issue=7&spage=996&epage=&aulast=Tallner&aufirst=A.&auinit=A.&aufull=Tallner+A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=996-&date=2014&auinit1=A&auinitm=","Embase"

Selfmanagement empowers PwMS to manage their health (Ryan and Sawin 2009). Technology including increased Smartphone penetration (Aquino and Radwanick 2012) has potential to measure health outcomes (Pascu et al 2013). Research is limited for MS PA monitoring potential Aims: To investigate validity of Smartphone based PA monitors (PAM) and Sensewear armband (SWA) as measures of step count (SC) and energy expenditure (EE) in PwMS with varying disability levels during everyday tasks Methods: 13 PwMS requiring at most a walking stick were recruited. The SWA, video analysis (VA), MS Pedometer application (MP) and Smartphone application (PR) measured step count and EE (kilocalories) during cycling (CY), cleaning a worktop (CW), outdoor walking (OW) and 6 Minute Walk Test (6MWT). Data was analysed using SPSS version 21. Appropriate Pearson's correlation coefficients assessed correlations between PAM. Spearman's test assessed 6MWT. Mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) between methods were calculated Results: For SC during 6MWT, MP and SWA had excellent statistically significant correlations (SSC) with VA (r=0.774à.780, p<0.05). MP had excellent SSC with SWA (r=0.886, p<0.05) for OW. Moderate non-SSC were found for VA with SWA, MP for CW, and PR with SWA for OW (r=0.558à.645, p>0.05). PR had poor non-SSC with VA (r=0.155, p>0.05) for 6MWT. For EE, PR had poor non-SSC with SWA for CW, CY and 6MWT (r=0.153à.444, p>0.05) and moderate non-SSC for OW (r=0.548, p>0.05) SC ICCs were .598à.796. EE estimates ranged .067à.156. All devices underestimated steps by 3.6à26.4% of total steps versus VA for 6MWT, CW and OW except MP which overestimated by 15.46% for OW. PR underestimated EE versus SWA for 6MWT, CY and OW (160.87à195.29%) but overestimated for CW (19.36%) Step MDs were non-significant and ranged 3.77à77.31 with wide CI (-107.54à256.08). EE MDs ranged -52.08à4.05 (-66.93à14.77) Conclusions: Excellent SSC between MP and SWA for 6MWT and OW and moderate SSC for CW suggest strong SC criterion validity of the devices when walking but MDs were nonsignificant with considerable random variation PR was poorly correlated with other devices for SC and EE. It demonstrated vast under and overestimation % errors, suggesting PR is not sensitive for MS PA monitoring. Future psychometric property investigation of these PAM is warranted.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458514533628","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13524585&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458514533628&atitle=Validation+of+accelerometer-based+Smartphone+application+measures+of+physical+activity+for+people+with+MS&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=20&issue=7&spage=995&epage=&aulast=Fitzgerald&aufirst=L.&auinit=L.&aufull=Fitzgerald+L.&coden=&isbn=&pages=995-&date=2014&auinit1=L&auinitm=","Embase"

Little is known about the ability of sensory integration to improve after neurological lesions. A major knowledge of balance deficits in MS may be useful to identify different clinical patterns that would benefit from different rehabilitative treatments. Aim: The aim of the present study is to compare two methods of training to improve the balance control in MS patients with multisensory dysfunction (somatosensory, visual and vestibular). Methods: Ten consecutive MS patients with balance deficit and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score between 3.5 and 6.5 were randomly assigned to two groups of treatment. All the patients were treated for 10 sessions for 2 weeks. The first group received 40 minutes daily of balance treatment using a computerized movable forceplate and visual surround (smart balance master). The second group received balance rehabilitation with the Brain Port device (two daily sessions, 21 minutes each, one with 4 hours of break). Brain Port is a new device with an electrotactile stimulation that is applied on the surface of the tongue; it consists of a little accelerometer that underlines the head position and generates as biofeedback a continuous perceptible but painless stimulus. In each group we analyzed the postural stability and different patterns of reaction to perturbations of balance. The assessment, at the beginning and at the end of the treatment, consisted on clinical (Berg balance scale, Tinetti scale, dynamic gait index) and kinematic evaluation (smart balance master). Results: Preliminary data and comparative results will be presented. Conclusions: The comparison between these two treatments allows a posturographic assessment, an effective balance training in MS patients with mild to moderate disability but a high risk of falls, and can also identify the prevalent balance alteration in each patient. A larger sample of patients is needed to verify possible results and to optimize treatments.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458515573128","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13524585&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458515573128&atitle=A+comparison+between+two+technological+tools+for+balance+training+in+patients+with+progressive+multiple+sclerosis%3A+A+pilot+study&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=21&issue=4&spage=503&epage=&aulast=Cadorin&aufirst=C.&auinit=C.&aufull=Cadorin+C.&coden=&isbn=&pages=503-&date=2015&auinit1=C&auinitm=","Embase"

Within this field, researchers in need of developing FES-based control solutions for specific disabilities often have to choose between either the acquisition and integration of high-performance industry-level systems, which are rather expensive and hardly portable, or develop custom-made portable solutions, which despite their lower cost, usually require expert-level electronic skills. Here, a flexible low-cost microcontroller-based platform for rapid prototyping of FES neuroprostheses is presented, designed for reduced execution complexity, development time, and production cost. For this reason, the Arduino open-source microcontroller platform was used, together with off-the-shelf components whenever possible. The developed system enables the rapid deployment of portable FES-based gait neuroprostheses, being flexible enough to allow simple open-loop strategies but also more complex closed-loop solutions. The system is based on a modular architecture that allows the development of optimized solutions depending on the desired FES applications, even though the design and testing of the platform were focused toward drop foot correction. The flexibility of the system was demonstrated using two algorithms targeting drop foot condition within different experimental setups.

It has uses not only as a research tool but in clinical settings as well, for example in monitoring cell-based regenerative therapies, in which cells are transplanted to replace degenerating or damaged tissues, or to restore a physiological function. The success of such cell-based therapies depends on several critical issues, including the route and accuracy of cell transplantation, the fate of cells after transplantation, and the interaction of engrafted cells with the host microenvironment. To assess these issues, it is necessary to monitor transplanted cells non-invasively in real-time. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a tool uniquely suited to this task, given its ability to image deep inside tissue with high temporal resolution and sensitivity. Extraordinary efforts have recently been made to improve cellular MRI as applied to regenerative medicine, by developing more advanced contrast agents for use as probes and sensors. These advances enable the non-invasive monitoring of cell fate and, more recently, that of the different cellular functions of living cells, such as their enzymatic activity and gene expression, as well as their time point of cell death. We present here a review of recent advancements in the development of these probes and sensors, and of their functioning, applications and limitations.","Review","10.1242/DMM.018499","WOS:000352162500001","WoS"

To complement patient reports of fatigue in MS, a range of objective performance metrics based on ambulation have been demonstrated as feasible, including a deceleration index. This potentially offers an additional and potentially sensitive characterisation of ambulatory motor fatigue. An affordable way to determine detailed aspects of walking (potentially including foot drop) would be based on wearable inertial sensors. Methods: Fully-ambulatory persons with multiple sclerosis (PwMS, N = 19) and age-matched healthy volunteers (N = 15) were instrumented with 7 sensors (placed on lateral aspects of shoes, ankles, thighs, and on the lumbar spine) with 3 axes of gyroscopy and accelerometry recording at 128 Hz (or 102.4 Hz). Participants performed a six minute walk (6MW), and strides from the full-speed straight-walking regions of the walk were recognised via machine learning and dynamic time warping. Results: Distance-dependent changes (slopes) of pre-determined metrics were assessed by least squares linear fitting of the metrics by individual. Significant differences in the distance-dependent slopes between PwMS and age-matched, healthy volunteers included the MS patients having a decreasing cadence (t = 2.26, P < 0.05), and increasing stride time (t = 2.10, P < 0.05). As MS patients progressed in the 6MW (but not healthy controls), the mean accelerometry signal from the shoe sensors in the vertical direction decreased (t = 2.21, P < 0.05), suggesting diminished foot drive. The slope of increase of stride time was correlated with subjective ratings on the Fatigue Severity Scale (rho = 0.44, P < 0.05), as was the slope of the mean accelerometry signal from the shoes sensors in the upward direction (rho = 0.423, P < 0.05). Conclusions: Wearable inertial sensors have the potential to provide specific metrics of ambulatory fatigue in MS with good face value. Future studies using these sensors have the potential to realise additional information on gait characterisation including specific deficits such as foot drop and may provide sensitive measures of gait abnormality associated with disease progression.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458515602642","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13524585&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458515602642&atitle=Ambulatory+motor+fatigue+in+MS+assessed+by+wearable+inertial+sensor+metrics+during+the+six+minute+walk&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=23&issue=11&spage=307&epage=308&aulast=Oberndorfer&aufirst=C.&auinit=C.&aufull=Oberndorfer+C.&coden=&isbn=&pages=307-308&date=2015&auinit1=C&auinitm=","Embase"

Accelerometric (ACC) and electromyographic (EMG) recordings were performed in 26 MS patients complaining of clumsiness, associated (n= 16) or not associated (n= 10) with visible tremor. Seventeen healthy subjects with physiological tremor (PT) and eight patients with essential tremor (ET) served as controls. Signals were analyzed using non-linear Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and related Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT), compared to the standard linear spectral analysis using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The presence of cerebellar signs and motor deficit was assessed on clinical examination. Using FFT, tremor was found in all patients with ET and 12% of subjects with PT, but in none of the MS patients, even in the presence of visible tremor. In contrast, EMD-HHT analysis of ACC-EMG coupling showed common frequency peaks characterizing tremor related to a central generator in 62.5% of MS patients with visible tremor, 40% of MS patients without visible tremor, 29% of subjects with PT, and all patients with ET. In EMD-HHT analysis, tremor characteristics were similar in subjects with PT and MS patients, regardless of the presence of a visible tremor, but these characteristics clearly differed in patients with ET. A visible tremor in MS patients was associated with more frequent cerebellar signs and less motor deficit at the upper limb. The low-frequency tremor observed in MS patients could therefore originate in lesions of the brainstem (midbrain) or cerebellothalamic circuits, or may correspond to an enhanced PT, partly favored by cerebellar dysfunction and being more visible during movement execution in the absence of concomitant motor deficit.","Article","10.1016/J.NEUCLI.2015.09.013","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=17697131&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.neucli.2015.09.013&atitle=Analysis+of+tremor+in+multiple+sclerosis+using+Hilbert-Huang+Transform&stitle=Neurophysiol.+Clin.&title=Neurophysiologie+Clinique&volume=45&issue=6&spage=475&epage=484&aulast=Ayache&aufirst=S.-S.&auinit=S.-S.&aufull=Ayache+S.-S.&coden=NCLIE&isbn=&pages=475-484&date=2015&auinit1=S&auinitm=-S","Embase"

This study aimed to investigate the antibody binding characteristics of serial sera in a subset of these two patient groups. Using Biacore™, a surface plasmon resonance-based technology that monitors biomolecular interactions in real time, we immobilized pure IFNβ-1b and analyzed antibody binding responses and dissociation rates of these sera. NAb titers correlated directly with binding responses and inversely with dissociation rates, and sera from sustained NAb patients demonstrated significantly higher binding responses and slower dissociation rates than sera from transient NAb patients.

Objective: To assess the effect of PR-fampridine in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) using different walking tests measures. Methods: Clinical assessments, performed at baseline and 2 weeks after treatment with PR-fampridine, included: the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), 12-item MS walking scale (MSWS-12), quality of life (EQ-5D-5L), timed 25-foot walk (T25FW), 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and average daily walking activity (aDWA) by a triaxial accelerometer. An improvement in T25FW > 20% and/or MSWS-12 score > 6 points were used to define clinical response. Patients were grouped according to the clinical response: to two tests (T25FW and MSWS-12), one test (T25FW or MSWS-12) or no response. Results: We included 22 patients with a mean age of 51.7 years and disease duration of 15.8 years; median Expanded Disability Status Scale score was 5.8, and mean T25FW 14.6 seconds. Three patients had adverse events (imbalance, n=3, nausea, n=1) but only one discontinued PR-fampridine.

Probabilistic tractography based on Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) data from Magnet Resonance Imaging (MRI) allows now to model individual structural brain connectivity networks. The analysis of such connectoms is a new promising method to investigate neurodegeneration and the association with disability (e.g. mobility impairment) in MS. Objective: To investigate the association between individual connectoms and mobility in primary progressive MS (PPMS). Methods: 35 PPMS patients (52y; median Expanded Disability Status Scale 3.5 [2-7]) underwent cranial MRIs (T1w, T2w, DTI images) and a mobility assessment including Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW), Timed-Tandem-Walk, 6-Minute-Walk and accelerometry data covering 7 days (including step number, distance, physical activity level, walking speed). Standard MRI atrophy measures included FSL-SIENAX derived global volumes and T2 lesion volume. Individual networks were modelled based on connectivity indices from probabilistic tractography between FreeSurfer subcortical regions. We used graph theoretical methods to identify highly connected integrative brain regions as well as network hubs associated with mobility. In addition, correlations of individual network parameters with mobility outcomes were investigated. Results: Standard MRI parameters were not correlated with mobility outcomes. Based on the weighted degree of the nodes, insula, cingulum, precuneus, superior frontal and parietal cortical regions were the over all five mostly connected brain regions. Precuneus, insula, thalamus, putamen and precentral cortex were identified as major network hubs associated with walking abilities. Average path length of individual networks correlated with T25FW (r=0.4, p< 0.05) and real-life physical activity (r=-0.4, p< 0.05). Conclusion: Brain regions well known for their integrative role within the brain network of healthy individuals could be confirmed in MS. Beside these regions, connectivity of basal ganglia and the primary motor cortex is associated with mobility in our cohort. In contrast to standard MRI measures, network parameters from individual connectoms correlated with real-life physical activity and the T25FW. Connectom analyses should be further investigated as a potential sensitive outcome to assess brain network integrity in MS.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458515602639","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13524585&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458515602639&atitle=Connectoms+from+DTI+based+probabilistic+tractography+are+associated+with+walking+and+real-life+physical+activity+in+PPMS&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=23&issue=11&spage=748&epage=749&aulast=Stellmann&aufirst=J.-P.&auinit=J.-P.&aufull=Stellmann+J.-P.&coden=&isbn=&pages=748-749&date=2015&auinit1=J&auinitm=-P","Embase"

Instrumented measurement of standing postural sway with inertial motion sensors may provide sensitive measures of balance impairment and better correspond with patient reports. Methods: While wearing wireless inertial sensors, 20 subjects with MS - Expanded Disability Status Scale of less than 3.0 and a Timed 25 Foot Walk of 5 sec or less - and 20 age- and sex-matched control subjects stood with eyes open and eyes closed on a foam surface. Forty-six outcome measures of postural sway were derived. A stepwise logistic regression model determined which measures of instrumented sway provide independent predictors of group status. Subjects with MS also completed the Activities-Specific Balance Confidence (ABC) scale and the 12-Item MS Walking Scale (MSWS-12) as measures of subject-reported balance and mobility impairment. Results: The regression model identified medio-lateral sway path length and medio-lateral range of sway acceleration amplitude, each in the eyes-open condition, as the only two significant independent predictors to differentiate subjects with MS from those without MS (model chi-squared∈=∈34.55, p∈<∈0.0001): accuracy∈=∈87.5 %, positive likelihood ratio∈=∈6 (2.09-17.21), negative likelihood ratio∈=∈0.12 (0.03-0.44).

Conclusions: Postural sway abnormalities in subjects with MS who are minimally disabled were detected using wireless inertial sensors and may signify a superior sensitivity to identify balance impairment prior to developing clinically evident disability or impaired gait speed.

The objective was to determine factors affecting physical activity in minimally impaired pwMS. Patients and Methods: We recruited 52 minimally impaired pwMS and measured physical activity with Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ) and an accelerometer used for the 7-day period.

Oral therapies lack the barrier of selfinjection and patient programs seem not mandatory. Yet, various studies for oral drugs have shown that efficient therapy handling and adherence to therapy is not guaranteed. Oral medications like delayed-release dimethyl fumarate (DMF; gastro-resistant) have their own challenges. The objective of this retrospective cohort study is to evaluate a real-life cohort of DMF patients in the time course of up to 15 months of therapy experience. Furthermore, the potential benefit of individual patient coaching is analysed. Methods: From February 2014 patients were recruited. All patients signed a written consent form and received the code for a smartphone application with reminder function. Coached patients were in contact by phone at least 2 times with the personal coach in the first month. Afterwards contents and coaching frequency were adapted according to patient needs including motivational interviewing and compliance coaching. The control cohort of not coached patients was contacted 1-2 times per year. Results: As of April 2015, 7518 patients taking DMF have been recruited. In total, data for 6573 DMF patients including 1123 dropouts could be analyzed. More than 50% of the dropouts have discontinued DMF therapy in the first three months. Gastrointestinal issues were reported as the most frequent dropout reason (38.8%) of the discontinuers. While gastrointestinal issues were most frequent in the first two therapy months, incidence is constantly decreasing in the ongoing months. Patients further reported flushing/ pruritus (12.1%), ongoing disease activity (11.7%) and changes in blood counts (7.9%) as reasons for therapy discontinuation. Dropout reason and time to therapy discontinuation were differentiated for coached and not coached patients. 3.5%, 6.2% and 9.6% of coached patients stopped therapy after 3, 6 and 12 months compared to 7.8%, 13.2% and 25% of the controls, respectively. Patients in the control cohort tended to quit therapy more often because of partly manageable side effects like gastrointestinal problems and flushing/pruritus. Conclusion: Side effects reported in the phase III studies are also the main reasons for discontinuing DMF therapy in the real-world setting. Patient coaching provides an essential contribution to overcome preventable or manageable side effects, leading to therapy continuation and treatment satisfaction.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458515602642","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13524585&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458515602642&atitle=Disparities+and+challenges+to+oral+disease+modifying+MS+therapies+and+the+potential+of+individualized+patient+coaching&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=23&issue=11&spage=582&epage=&aulast=Begus-Nahrmann&aufirst=Y.&auinit=Y.&aufull=Begus-Nahrmann+Y.&coden=&isbn=&pages=582-&date=2015&auinit1=Y&auinitm=","Embase"

This enzyme is a peripheral biomarker of neuroinflammation in multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic autoimmune disease of the central nervous system. Presently, expensive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies are used to monitor subclinical disease activity in MS. An alternative to costly MRI scans could be the detection of MMP-9, using a low-cost, disposable sensor system for MMP-9 suitable for home-monitoring of inflammation. This would allow an early prediction of the failure of anti-inflammatory therapies and more timely clinical intervention to limit neuronal damage and prevent disability. Herein we present the development of a disposable sensor for fast and straightforward detection of MMP-9. Biosensors were produced by coating electrodes with oxidized dextran and subsequent cross-linking with peptides containing specific cleavage sites for MMP-9. Exposure of the films to the enzyme resulted in the degradation of the films, which was monitored using impedance measurements. Sensor response was rapid, a significant impedance change was usually observed within 5. min after the addition of MMP-9. Sensors showed a negligible response to matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), a protease which may interfere with MMP-9 detection. The peptide sequence with the highest sensitivity and selectivity Leu-Gly-Arg-Met-Gly-Leu-Pro-Gly-Lys was selected to construct calibration curves. MMP-9 was successfully detected in a clinically relevant range from 50 to 400. ng/ml. Two different processes of hydrogel degradation were observed on electrode surfaces with different roughness, and both appeared suitable to monitor MMP-9 activity. The sensor materials are generic and can be easily adopted to respond to other proteases by selecting peptide cross-linkers with suitable cleavage sites.","Article","10.1016/J.BIOS.2015.01.060","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=18734235&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.bios.2015.01.060&atitle=Disposable+MMP-9+sensor+based+on+the+degradation+of+peptide+cross-linked+hydrogel+films+using+electrochemical+impedance+spectroscopy&stitle=Biosens.+Bioelectron.&title=Biosensors+and+Bioelectronics&volume=68&issue=&spage=660&epage=667&aulast=Biela&aufirst=Anna&auinit=A.&aufull=Biela+A.&coden=BBIOE&isbn=&pages=660-667&date=2015&auinit1=A&auinitm=","Embase"

EDSS rating is highly variable between raters because of subjective ratings. Moreover, several functional system scores (FSS) ratings can be considered as complex (such as visual or sensitive FSS), which can lead to rating mistakes. Objective: To present a smartphone application which is meant to simplify EDSS rating in daily practice. Results: We develop an application for iOS devices running on iOS 8 (iPhone and iPad). First, the user is invited to determine the ambulatory function which allows the determination of the EDSS if the patient is not fully ambulatory. Then, the user will be able to rate each FSS. For each FSS, the user will only be invited to precise the neurological exam findings. For example, for the sensitive FSS determination, the user will have to precise if there is an alteration of vibration sense, graphesthesia, nociception and proprioceptive tests. Severity and number of affected limbs are asked if the function is declared to be altered. Then the FSS score will be automatically determined according to Kurtzke definitions. EDSS score is automatically determined depending on each FSS and ambulatory function. Discussion: Even if EDSS remains a simple and reliable tool for assessing disability in MS, inter and intra rater variability has often been considered as a weakness. In the research setting, the Neurostatus is widely used in order to reduce rating variability. The application we developed aims to simplify EDSS rating in the daily practice setting, by reducing the risk of FSS rating mistakes and EDSS step determination. Inter rater variability due to subjective rating may remain however. Easy EDSS Score is available in the AppStore.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458515602642","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13524585&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458515602642&atitle=Easy+EDSS+Score%3A+Simplified+EDSS+rating+using+a+smartphone+application&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=23&issue=11&spage=118&epage=119&aulast=Cohen&aufirst=M.&auinit=M.&aufull=Cohen+M.&coden=&isbn=&pages=118-119&date=2015&auinit1=M&auinitm=","Embase"

Short clinical gait tests up to ten meters and 2- or 6-Minutes Walking Tests (2MWT/6MWT) are used as performance-based outcomes in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) studies and considered as moderately associated with real life mobility. Objective: To investigate the ecological validity of 10 Meter Walking Test (10mWT), 2MWT and 6MWT. Methods: Persons with MS performed 10mWT, 6MWT including 2MWT and 7 recorded days by accelerometry. Ecological validity was assumed if walking tests represented a typical walking sequence in real-life and correlations with accelerometry parameters were strong. Results: In this cohort (n=28, medians: age=45, EDSS=3.2, disease duration=9 years), uninterrupted walking of 2 or 6 minutes occurred not frequent in real life (2.61 and 0.35 sequences/day). 10mWT correlated only with slow walking speed quantiles in real life. 2MWT and 6MWT correlated moderately with most real life walking parameters. Conclusion: Clinical gait tests over a few meters have a poor ecological validity while validity is moderate for 2MWT and 6MWT.

ANOVA were used to evaluate the effects of testing session on the Brief-BESTest, instrumented stance and gait recordings by inertial motion sensors, lower-limb strength recorded by force transducers, accelerometry-based activity, the 12-item MS Walking Scale (MSWS-12), the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 (MSQOL-54) questionnaire, the Modified Fatigue Impact scale (MFIS) and the Activity-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) scale.RESULTS: The intervention associated with significantly improved scores on the MSQOL-54 mental component, MFIS, MSWS-12 and Brief-BESTest. Sway amplitude significantly decreased and jerk significantly increased during instrumented standing on foam with eyes closed. Instrumented gait recordings of sagittal trunk range of motion also significantly decreased. ABC scores, strength measures and activity measures were not significantly changed.CONCLUSIONS: Ten weeks of functional balance exercises provided a feasible intervention for individuals with MS that improved components of balance, mental well-being and perceived fatigue impact and ambulation disability. A future randomized, controlled clinical trial should confirm these preliminary findings. Implications for Rehabilitation A balance-specific exercise program is both safe and feasible for individuals with mild-to-moderate MS. Comprehensive exercise interventions that are conceptually driven and employ well-designed progressive exercise across multiple contexts of balance control can facilitate improvements in balance impairments associated with MS. Functional balance exercises can positively impact clinical and objective measures of balance control and favorably influence perceptions of ambulation disability and fatigue as well as perceived quality of life in people with MS.","Article","10.3109/09638288.2015.1019008","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14645165&id=doi:10.3109%2F09638288.2015.1019008&atitle=Effects+of+balance-specific+exercises+on+balance%2C+physical+activity+and+quality+of+life+in+adults+with+multiple+sclerosis%3A+a+pilot+investigation&stitle=Disabil+Rehabil&title=Disability+and+rehabilitation&volume=37&issue=24&spage=2238&epage=2249&aulast=Kasser&aufirst=Susan+L.&auinit=S.L.&aufull=Kasser+S.L.&coden=&isbn=&pages=2238-2249&date=2015&auinit1=S&auinitm=L","Embase"

Methods: Thirty-eight participant pairs (MS and cohabitant) aged 18-55 years participated in the study. Each participant received an Android HTC Sensation 4G smartphone containing a custom application suite of 19 tests capturing participant performance and patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Over 1 year, participants were prompted daily to complete one assigned test. Results: A total of 22 patients with MS and 17 cohabitants completed the entire study. Among patients with MS, low scores on PROs relating tomental and visual function were associated with dropout (p < 0.05). We illustrate several novel features of a smartphone platform. First, fluctuations in MS outcomes (e.g., fatigue) were assessed against an individual's ambient environment by linking responses to meteorological data. Second, both response accuracy and speed for the Ishihara color vision test were captured, highlighting the benefits of both active and passive data collection. Third, a new trait, a person-specific learning curve in neuropsychological testing, was identified using spline analysis. Finally, averaging repeated measures over the study yielded the most robust correlation matrix of the different outcome measures. Conclusions: We report the feasibility of, and barriers to, deploying a smartphone platform to gather useful passive and active performance data at high frequency in an unstructured manner in the field. A smartphone platform may therefore enable large-scale naturalistic studies of patients with MS or other neurologic diseases.","Article","10.1212/NXI.0000000000000162","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=23327812&id=doi:10.1212%2FNXI.0000000000000162&atitle=Evaluating+more+naturalistic+outcome+measures&stitle=Neurol.+Neuroimmunol.+Neuroinflamm.&title=Neurology%3A+Neuroimmunology+and+NeuroInflammation&volume=2&issue=6&spage=&epage=&aulast=Bove&aufirst=Riley&auinit=R.&aufull=Bove+R.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2015&auinit1=R&auinitm=","Embase"

Fatigue in the context of MS is a complex symptom that affects 75-95% of all patients, of which 50-60 % classify fatigue as interfering most seriously with the activities of daily life. Aim: This pilot telehealth study evaluated whether telecoaching with a focus on energy management and enhancement of physical activity was able to improve fatigue in MS patients with moderate to severe fatigue during a 12 week-period. Methodology: 70 MS patients with moderate to severe fatigue were evaluated over 12 weeks in their home setting, with 4 assessments. Inclusion criteria were: having relapsing remitting MS, an EDSS of 4 or lower, treatment with glatiramer acetate for at least 6 weeks and a score of 53 or higher on the Fatigue Scale for Motor and Cognitive functions (FSMC). Patients with age 60 or above, with MDD, with severe cognitive impairment, injuries and pregnant patients were excluded. In a 2 week run-in period, daily activity was measured using the mobile MS TeleCoach handhold device. During the 12 week follow- up phase, fatigue was measured 3 times a day using the VAS impact on fatigue question and physical activity was continuously monitored via an integrated accelerometer in the MS TeleCoach. Patients receive coaching advice thrice weekly to enhance their physical activity (gradually increasing by 5 % versus baseline, every 3 weeks) compared to their baseline physical activity. Clinical status of the patient and 5 outcome measures (FSMC, Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, Short Form-36, Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale and Illness Perception Scale) were assessed at all visits. Results: The mean difference in total FSMC score between end and start of the study was -6.37 (p=0.000056). The mean difference in the cognitive subscale of the FSMC score between end and start of the study was -2.9 (p=0.0011) and the mean difference in the motor subscale of the FSMC score between end and start of the study was -3.46 (p=0.00074).

Objectives: To determine the prevalence and severity of fatigue in persons with subacute spinal cord injury (SCI), assess whether demographic and lesion characteristics are related to fatigue and determine the relationship with physical fitness and physical behavior. Setting: Measurements were performed 2 months before discharge from inpatient rehabilitation. Methods: Thirty-six persons with subacute SCI, dependent on a manual wheelchair, mean age 43 +/- 15 and 83% men, completed the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). FSS scores 44 indicated fatigue. We recorded age and lesion characteristics, measured body mass index, measured peak power output and peak oxygen uptake during a maximal handcycling test and determined physical behavior using an accelerometer-based activity monitor. T-tests were used to test for differences in fatigue between subgroups based on age and lesion characteristics, and regression analyses to assess the relationship with physical fitness and physical behavior. Results: Mean FSS was 3.3 +/- 1.3. Fatigue, including severe fatigue, was prevalent in 31% (95% confidence interval: 16-46) of participants compared with 18% in the general population. Furthermore, mean fatigue was significantly higher in persons with incomplete compared with complete lesions (t=2.22, P=0.03). Mean scores between other subgroups did not differ significantly. Of the physical fitness and physical behavior measures, only peak oxygen uptake tended to be related to more fatigue (B=-1.47, P=0.05). Conclusion: Fatigue was prevalent and is of concern in persons with subacute SCI. Those with incomplete lesions seem to be at higher risk. Because fatigue is known to persist among persons with SCI, interventions to reduce fatigue seem necessary.","Article","10.1038/SC.2015.66","WOS:000362459000009","WoS"

MethodSixty-five young people aged 8 to 17years (35 males, 30 females; mean age 13y 2mo, SD 2y 8mo) with mild to moderate physical disabilities (Gillette Functional Assessment Questionnaire levels 7-10) were recruited. Self-reported fatigue was measured using the PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale. Physical activity was measured using 7-day hip-worn accelerometer. Associations between fatigue, physical activity, and socio-demographic characteristics were examined using analysis of covariance, with significance () set at 0.05. Results were compared with normative data from other paediatric populations. ResultsAmong children with physical disabilities, fatigue was associated with being physically inactive (F-statistic=4.42, p=0.040), female (F=4.37, p=0.042), and of low socio-economic status (F=3.94, p=0.050). Fatigue was not associated with age, weight status, or functional impairment. Young people with physical disabilities experienced high levels of fatigue compared with other paediatric health populations, and comparable to the paediatric cancer population. InterpretationFatigue is an important issue for young people with physical disabilities. Clinicians and researchers working with this group should be mindful that fatigue is likely to impact on an individual's ability to undertake new treatment regimens or interventions. Interventions aimed at reducing fatigue are warranted. Increasing physical activity might play a role in reducing fatigue.","Article","10.1111/DMCN.12736","WOS:000357790000015","WoS"

A sustained increase of cytoplasmic free [Ca2+] is a common upstream event of many neuronal and axonal damage processes and could represent an early and potentially reversible step. New method: We propose a method to specifically analyze the neurodegenerative aspects of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) imaging of neuronal and axonal Ca2+ dynamics by two-photon laser scanning microscopy (TPLSM). Results: Using the genetically encoded Ca2+ sensor TN-XXL expressed in neurons and their corresponding axons, we confirm the increase of cytoplasmic free [Ca2+] in axons and neurons of autoimmune inflammatory lesions compared to those in non-inflamed brains. We show that these relative [Ca2+] increases were associated with immune-neuronal interactions. Comparison with existing methods: In contrast to Ca2+-sensitive dyes the use of a genetically encoded Ca2+ sensor allows reliable intraaxonal free [Ca2+] measurements in living anesthetized mice in health and disease. This method detects early axonal damage processes in contrast to e.g. cell/axon morphology analysis, that rather detects late signs of neurodegeneration. Conclusions: Thus, we describe a method to analyze and monitor early neuronal damage processes in the brain in vivo. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Objective: This study aimed to provide additional validity evidence for the SSST in 96 persons with MS, based on construct validity and precision. Construct validity involves examining the pattern of associations between the SSST and other measures, and precision involves comparing SSST performance relative to other valid measures of ambulation for differentiating between levels of disability status, MS clinical course, and fall risk based on balance confidence. Methods: All participants completed the SSST, T25FW, Timed Up-and-Go (TUG), six-minute walk, Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale-12, Late-Life Function and Disability Inventory, Activities-specific Balance Confidence, and Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test. All participants further underwent a neurological examination for generating EDSS scores, and then wore an ActiGraph accelerometer for the waking hours of a 7-day period. Results: SSST performance was strongly associated with other valid measures of ambulation (|ρ| = .65-.90) and disability status (ρ=.73), moderately-to-strongly associated with balance confidence (ρ=.58), and weakly-to-moderately associated with cognitive processing speed and non-ambulatory measures (|ρ| = .35-.39). The SSST demonstrated stronger relative precision in discriminating between levels of disability status, MS clinical course, and fall risk based on balance confidence than the T25FW and TUG. Conclusions: We provide comprehensive validity evidence for the SSST that supports its consideration for inclusion alongside other highly-regarded objective measures of ambulatory function for clinical research and practice in persons with MS.","Article","10.1016/J.GAITPOST.2014.10.011","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=18792219&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.gaitpost.2014.10.011&atitle=Further+validation+of+the+Six-Spot+Step+Test+as+a+measure+of+ambulation+in+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Gait+Posture&title=Gait+and+Posture&volume=41&issue=1&spage=222&epage=227&aulast=Sandroff&aufirst=Brian+M.&auinit=B.M.&aufull=Sandroff+B.M.&coden=GAPOF&isbn=&pages=222-227&date=2015&auinit1=B&auinitm=M","Embase"

However, recent concerns regarding quality of content and regulation have been raised. Purpose To describe the characteristics and content of mobile applications related to multiple sclerosis (MS), as well as assess the level of participation of health professionals (HP) in their development. Material and methods A descriptive observational study was carried out during August 2014. Smartphone applications specifically relating to MS were searched for using a keyword search with the term “MS” in the Apple App Store (iOS) and the Google Play Store (Android). Data recorded for every applications included: name, platform, cost, category, user star rating, number of downloads (available for Android only), updated date and target audience. The applications were analysed and categorised based on the information content into four groups: (1) diagnosis and management, (2) general information, (3) news, (4) tracking. Besides, we specifically examined the authorship in order to assess the prevalence of HP participation in their development. Results Twenty-one applications were identified for Android, 22 apps for iOS, among which there were 12 duplicates. Most of these applications were free of charge (83.8%) and uploaded under the medical category (51.6%). A total of 23 had customer satisfaction ratings; nine with <3.9 stars (out of 5). The highest rated application was “Multiple sclerosis @Point of care”. Eleven applications had exceeded 1,000 downloads. The most downloaded application was “MS Diagnosis and Management”. 64.5% had been updated in the last year.

This paper describes a method to extract upper limb intention tremor from gyroscope data, through the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT), a technique suitable for the study of nonlinear and non-stationary processes. The aims of the study were to: (i) evaluate the method's ability to discriminate between healthy controls and MS subjects; (ii) validate the proposed procedure against clinical tremor scores assigned using Fahn's tremor rating scale (FTRS); and (iii) compare the performance of the HHT-based method with that of linear band-pass filters. Approach. HHT was applied on gyroscope data collected on 20 MS subjects and 13 healthy controls (CO) during finger-to-nose tests (FNTs) instrumented with an inertial sensor placed on the hand. The results were compared to those obtained after traditional linear filtering. The tremor amplitude was quantified with instrumental indexes (TIs) and clinical FTRS ratings. Main results. The TIs computed after HHT-based filtering discriminated between CO and MS subjects with clinically-detected intention tremor (MS-T). In particular, TIs were significantly higher in the final part of the movement (TI<inf>2</inf>) with respect to the first part (TI<inf>1</inf>), and, for all components (X, Y, Z), MS-T showed a TI<inf>2</inf> significantly higher than in CO subjects. Moreover, the HHT detected subtle alterations not visible from clinical ratings, as TI<inf>2</inf> (Z-component) was significantly increased in MS subjects without clinically-detected tremor (MS-NT). The method's validity was demonstrated by significant correlations between clinical FTRS scores and TI<inf>2</inf> related to X (r<inf>s</inf> = 0.587, p = 0.006) and Y (r<inf>s</inf> = 0.682, p < 0.001) components. Contrarily, fewer differences among the groups and no correlation between instrumental and clinical indexes emerged after traditional filtering. Significance. The present results supported the use of the HHT-based procedure for a fully-automated quantitative and objective measure of intention tremor in MS, which can overcome the limitations of clinical scales and provide supplementary information about this sign.","Article","10.1088/1741-2560/12/4/046011","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=17412552&id=doi:10.1088%2F1741-2560%2F12%2F4%2F046011&atitle=Hilbert-Huang+transform+based+instrumental+assessment+of+intention+tremor+in+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=J.+Neural+Eng.&title=Journal+of+Neural+Engineering&volume=12&issue=4&spage=&epage=&aulast=Carpinella&aufirst=Ilaria&auinit=I.&aufull=Carpinella+I.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2015&auinit1=I&auinitm=","Embase"
"464","Carpinella I., Cattaneo D., Bonora G., Ferrarin M.","Instrumented finger-to-nose test for the quantitative assessment of intention tremor in multiple sclerosis: A Hilbert-Huang-based approach","Gait and Posture",2015,"Main topics: Analysis of clinical movement data, movement deviation indexes. Introduction and aim: Intention tremor, characterized by increasing amplitude toward the end of goal-directed movements, is a highly disabling symptom of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) [1]. It is usually assessed using clinical ordinal scales rating tremor amplitude during the finger-to-nose test. Although widely used, ordinal scales suffer from high examiner-dependency and poor sensitivity. In the present study, an instrumented finger-to-nose test (FTN) is proposed to overcome these limitations and provide an objective quantitative assessment of intention tremor in MS subjects. Patients/materials and methods: 20 MS subjects and 13 healthy controls (CO) executed FTN (5 repetitions) with an inertial sensor (Xsens, The Netherlands) on the hand's dorsum (X-axis longitudinal, Y medio-lateral, Z normal to the dorsum). Gyroscope signals were processed using Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) [2], a novel technique suitable for the analysis of non-linear and non- stationary processes. HHT consists of two steps: a) empirical mode decomposition, which decomposes the raw signal in a set of components called Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMF) and b) Hilbert spectral analysis which computes the time-course of instantaneous frequency and instantaneous amplitude of each IMF. After HHT, noise, tremor and voluntary movement were reconstructed, considering that voluntary movement is below 1 Hz while tremor in mainly between 2 Hz and 6 Hz with a vision-dependent component around 1Hz [3]. The following mode selection criterion was proposed: 1) median frequency (MF), median amplitude (MA) and inter-quartile range of amplitude (IQRA) were computed for each IMF; 2) IMFs with MF>7Hz were assigned to noise; 3) the IMF with the maximum MA and MF<1Hz was assigned to movement together with the subsequent modes; 4) IMFs with MF between 2 Hz and 7 Hz were assigned to tremor; 5) remaining IMFs, with MF around 1 Hz, were assigned to tremor if their MA was within the IQRA of the last mode assigned to tremor, else they were assigned to movement. A tremor index (TI: percentage ratio between root mean square of tremor and the norm of raw angular velocity) was proposed to quantify tremor during either the first and the final part of each FTN movement. Intention tremor was also clinically assessed through Fahn Tremor Rating Scale (FTRS). Results: FTRS showed intention tremor in 11MSsubjects (MS T) and no tremor in 9 patients (MS NT). According to the definition of intention tremor, TI of MS subjects was significantly higher in the final part of the movement (TI2) with respect to the first part (TI1). No such a difference was found in CO. As reported in Table 1, MS T showed a TI2 significantly higher than CO (X, Y and Z components) and MS NT (X and Y components). TI2 related to Z component was significantly altered also in MS NT. Finally, a significant positive correlation was found between FTRS score and TI2 related to X (ρ = 0.587, p = 0.006) and Y components (ρ = 0.682, p < 0.001). Discussion and conclusions: Present results suggest that HHT is a suitable technique to analyse intention tremor from gyroscope data in MS. With respect to common methods based on Fourier transform, the proposed procedure has two main advantages: i) it is able to automatically extract tremor components without any a priori knowledge of the tremor frequency specific of each subject, ii) it provides a finer separation between tremor and voluntary movement, that is essential to study the multiple components of MS tremor, which includes low-frequency components around 1 Hz. Moreover, the proposed tremor index (TI): i) is able to discriminate between healthy controls and MS subjects with tremor, ii) is significantly correlated with the clinical tremor score, iii) detects subtle alterations in MS subjects with FTRS = 0 that deserve further study. In conclusion, present results support the use of the proposed procedure as a quick and easy-to-use tool for the quantitative assessment of intention tremor in MS.","Conference Abstract","10.1016/J.GAITPOST.2015.03.066","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=18792219&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.gaitpost.2015.03.066&atitle=Instrumented+finger-to-nose+test+for+the+quantitative+assessment+of+intention+tremor+in+multiple+sclerosis%3A+A+Hilbert-Huang-based+approach&stitle=Gait+Posture&title=Gait+and+Posture&volume=42&issue=&spage=S34&epage=&aulast=Carpinella&aufirst=I.&auinit=I.&aufull=Carpinella+I.&coden=&isbn=&pages=S34-&date=2015&auinit1=I&auinitm=","Embase"

About 1/5 will eventually receive a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS). Up to 3/4 of children with MS suffer from depression, fatigue, and/or cognitive impairment. Previous studies in healthy adolescents and adults with MS have shown physical activity (PA) to benefit cognition and psychosocial outcomes. Investigating PA may help in the development of non-pharmacologic interventions for symptom management in pediatric MS. Goals: To investigate: (1) PA levels in youth with monophasic ADS (mono-ADS) and MS in comparison to healthy controls (HC); (2) The associations of PA levels in youth with MS wh experience fatigue and depression. Methods: 74 consecutive patients were recruited from the Neuroinflammatory Clinic at the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada (25 MS, 49 mono-ADS). 45 HC were recruited by flyers/word of mouth. Accelerometry (7 days), PA (Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ)), fatigue (PedsQL MFS) and depression (CES-DC) questionnaires were completed by all participants. SickKids research ethics approval was obtained. Results: MS participants (15.7±1.9 yo) were older than mono- ADS (13.7±2.6; p=0.001) and HC (14.4±2.4; p=0.03) participants. The proportion of females was not different across groups (p=0.14). Accelerometer data showed lower vigorous PA in the MS group (0.07±1.5 min/d) than in the mono-ADS (3.3±5.6 min/d; p=0.006) and HC (5.6±5.0 min/d; p=0.004) groups. On the GLTEQ, indicated MS patients compared with mono-ADS patients participated in lower levels of strenuous (17±18 vs. 30±21 METs, p=0.01) and total (42±29 vs. 63±32 METs, p=0.02) PA. Results remained after controlling for age. No differences were found in fatigue or depression between the groups. For the MS group, fatigue was correlated with depression (r=0.76) and vigorous PA was negatively correlated with fatigue (r=-0.53) and depression (r=-0.54). Conclusions: Youth with MS participate in less vigorous/strenuous PA than their mono-ADS and HC counterparts. Those who participate in higher levels of vigorous PA report fewer depressive and fatigue symptoms. This study is limited by its crosssectional nature, therefore, directionality of this association is unknown. Future investigations should focus on interventions that will help increase the amount of vigorous/strenuous PA as this may have the potential to ameliorate depression and fatigue in youth with MS.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458515602642","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13524585&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458515602642&atitle=Low+levels+of+participation+in+vigorous+physical+activity+in+youth+with+multiple+sclerosis+and+the+associations+with+fatigue+and+depression&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=23&issue=11&spage=379&epage=380&aulast=Grover&aufirst=S.A.&auinit=S.A.&aufull=Grover+S.A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=379-380&date=2015&auinit1=S&auinitm=A","Embase"

Mobility assessment, its ecological validity and its association with structural integrity of the brain and spinal cord is still a matter of discussion. Primary progressive MS (PPMS) has predominantly a neurodegenerative disease course, and investigating structural deficits without a major influence of acute inflammation is possible. Aims: To investigate the association between patient-reported outcomes (PROMs), walking tests, real life mobility assessment and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methods: Forty PPMS patients (mean age 52.4 years, mean disease duration 6.6 years, mean Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score 3.8) performed a timed-tandem walk (TTW), a timed 25 foot walk (T25fW), a 6-minute walking test (6MWT) and answered the Hamburg quality of life questionnaire for MS (HAQUAMS), the Godin-leisure-time (GLT) and the Frenchay activities of daily living (ADL) questionnaires.

Results: VBM and TBSS analyses revealed only a negligible association of EDSS and HAQUAMS mobility subscores with right frontal grey matter and tracts. Within a correlation network we could identify clusters of assessments. Clinical gait tests (T25fW, TTW, 6MWT) were linked to each other and moderately to EDSS, HAQUAMS and ADL. There was no significant correlation with the MRI. The number of steps, as detected with oneweek accelerometry, linked mobility to brain volume (Pearson correlation 0.4) and distance and steps correlated better with ADL (Pearson correlation ∼0.6). Out of the PROMs, only ADL were correlated with grey matter volume. Cervical spinal cord diameter and fractional anisotropy were not associated with other outcomes. Conclusion: Clinical walking tests such as T25fW and 6MWT showed a poor association with real-life mobility and MRI. Reallife mobility, PROMs and MRI might thus be applied as ecologically valid and pathophysiologically meaningful assessment network parameters for mobility in MS.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458515573128","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13524585&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458515573128&atitle=Mobility+in+primary+progressive+MS%3A+Correlation+of+structural+MRI%2C+mobility+assessments+and+patient+reportedoutcomes&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=21&issue=4&spage=497&epage=&aulast=Stellmann&aufirst=J.P.&auinit=J.P.&aufull=Stellmann+J.P.&coden=&isbn=&pages=497-&date=2015&auinit1=J&auinitm=P","Embase"

The parameters that are recorded by our system correspond to neurological deficits that are typical for multiple sclerosis (MS) like symptoms in animals. Normally, quantification of motor impairment requires neurological examination and complex behavioral testing. However, to perform these tests is an error-prone and time consuming process. Therefore, a strong interest exists in the automation and objective analysis of motoric behavior. Our presented small, accurate, and lightweight motion sensors provides an optimal solution for this problem. The developed motion sensors have the smallest volume and weight requirements available at the moment to monitor motoric dysfunction of animals. The collected data from the sensor is more representative since the subjective human factor is minimized and the animal can stay in its usual environment rather than being placed in a separate observation cage. We present two wireless motion sensors. An active sensor is powered with battery and saving the data on a SD-Card. The second sensor works completely passive and is powered via electromagnetic field. The sensors provide full control over the data of a three-axis accelerometer, a three-axis gyroscope, and a three-axis magnetometer. The two principles were successfully tested in an initial animal experiment.","Proceedings Paper",NA,"WOS:000380477800010","WoS"

In Germany >75% of the general population has internet access and the “World Wide Web” has become the most important source for health issues. Therefore we evaluated the role of social networks for health issues of MS patients. Methods: We sent out questionaires to 1554 MS Patients registered in our database. 486 individuals returned the questionnaires (32%). Questionnaires comprise questions about disease course and symptoms, internet usage (hardware, frequency, preferences) as well as depression and quality of life. Results: 89% of our cohort indicates to use the PC to access the world wide web, 56% use smartphones, but only 26% tablet computers. 52% of our patients use social networks, and more than 60% report a daily use. Among the social networks Facebook is by far the most popular platform, other providers like Xing, Instagram or Twitter are of minor importance. In addition only a minority of patients read private MSBlogs. Although a high proportion of MS patients use social networks only a minority join MS support groups on social platforms (12%) and take part in MS assistant services delivered via the Internet (4%). Conclusion: A high proportion of MS patients use social networks, in particular facebook. Actually health issues are not a primary reason to join a social network. Due to the intensive usage of social networks we believe that these networks should become an important tool for MS care centers in order to deliver health education.","Conference Abstract","10.1111/ENE.12807","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13515101&id=doi:10.1111%2Fene.12807&atitle=Multiple+sclerosis+and+social+networks&stitle=Eur.+J.+Neurol.&title=European+Journal+of+Neurology&volume=22&issue=&spage=480&epage=&aulast=G%C3%B6cke&aufirst=A.-K.&auinit=A.-K.&aufull=G%C3%B6cke+A.-K.&coden=&isbn=&pages=480-&date=2015&auinit1=A&auinitm=-K","Embase"

The expansion of activity tracking and personal data collection offers the potential for patient engagement in the management of chronic diseases. Consumer wearable devices for activity tracking have shown promise in post-surgery recovery in cardiac patients, pulmonary rehabilitation, and activity counseling in diabetic patients, among others. Unfortunately, the data generated by wearable devices is seldom integrated into programmatic self-management chronic disease regimens. In addition, there is lack of evidence supporting sustained use or effects on health outcomes, as studies have primarily focused on establishing the feasibility of monitoring activity and the association of measured activity with short-term benefits. Discussion: Monitoring devices can make a direct and real-time impact on self-management, but the validity and reliability of measurements need to be established. In order for patients to become engaged in wearable data gathering, key patient-centered issues relating to usefulness in care, motivation, the safety and privacy of information, and clinical integration need to be addressed. Because the successful usage of wearables requires an ability to comprehend and utilize personal health data, the user experience should account for individual differences in numeracy skills and apply evidence-based behavioral science principles to promote continued engagement. Summary: Activity monitoring has the potential to engage patients as advocates in their personalized care, as well as offer health care providers real world assessments of their patients' daily activity patterns. This potential will be realized as the voice of the chronic disease patients is accounted for in the design of devices, measurements are validated against existing clinical assessments, devices become part of the treatment 'prescription', behavior change programs are used to engage patients in self-management, and best practices for clinical integration are defined.","Article","10.1186/S12916-015-0319-2","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=17417015&id=doi:10.1186%2Fs12916-015-0319-2&atitle=Patient-centered+activity+monitoring+in+the+self-management+of+chronic+health+conditions&stitle=BMC+Med.&title=BMC+Medicine&volume=13&issue=1&spage=&epage=&aulast=Chiauzzi&aufirst=Emil&auinit=E.&aufull=Chiauzzi+E.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2015&auinit1=E&auinitm=","Embase"

A questionnaire on a wearable tool for unobtrusive motor and cognitive monitoring","Multiple Sclerosis",2015,"Background: Technologies have been increasingly adopted for use both in daily activities and clinical practice. Thus it is crucial to evaluate their usability, in particular for wearable systems that aim to facilitate a better quality of life in patients with motor and cognitive deficits. Aims: Here we assessed the predisposition and motivation of people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) to use wearable systems that are able to detect early changes in motor and cognitive performances and to allow the monitoring of daily activities. Methods: The study is based on the technology acceptance model (TAM), a standardized Likert questionnaire, which is able to measure an individual predisposition and motivation to use technologies. In particular, TAM evaluates the perceived usefulness and ease in using technologies, referring to a specific selected system, verbally described before the administration. Here we selected a wearable and unobtrusive system able to monitor motor and cognitive performances during daily activities and the related wellbeing status. In particular, this system, not yet realized, will allow unobtrusive recording of behavioural information about the user. It enables information to be automatically sent to the personal tablet and/or smartphone on a daily basis, for statistical analysis to detect potential changes that indicate a decline in performance. On the basis of the analysis simple exercises will be automatically suggested in order to recover a better status. Here we interviewed 28 PwMS (age range 26-75 years; Expanded Disability Status Scale score 0-8; disease course 50% RR, 45% SP, 5% PP). Results: Preliminary results about the perceived usefulness showed that PwMS considered the selected system useful (75%) and able to improve their activities (79%), although they reported a lower intention to use it again in the future (61%). This discrepancy could be due to the absence of a prototype. The 57% of the sample showed a feeling with technologies (70%). Therefore the system is considered easy to use, fully usable (68%) and agreeable (64%). Dependency from age and disease course, although expected, is still a matter of investigation. Conclusions: Results showed a good predisposition to the system. This was important both as a starting point for the actual design and development and because it took into account the final users' point of view. The TAM should be adopted in the device testing phase in order to assess if the actual use could modify the initial perceptions.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458515573128","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13524585&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458515573128&atitle=Predisposition+and+motivation+assessment+in+using+technologies+in+multiple+sclerosis.+A+questionnaire+on+a+wearable+tool+for+unobtrusive+motor+and+cognitive+monitoring&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=21&issue=4&spage=492&epage=&aulast=Tacchino&aufirst=A.&auinit=A.&aufull=Tacchino+A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=492-&date=2015&auinit1=A&auinitm=","Embase"

Design Randomized controlled trial, 3-month postintervention follow-up. Setting Home and general community, and university research laboratory. Participants Nonambulatory individuals with MS (N=14; mean age ± SD, 53.6±8.7y) were randomly assigned to an intervention group (IG) or a control group (CG). Interventions After baseline testing, the IG participants received custom-fit, ultralightweight manual wheelchairs with propulsion/skills training, followed by 3 months of at-home use with the custom ultralightweight wheelchair and weekly phone calls to deliver support through a multifactorial intervention. The CG participants received no training and used their own wheelchairs at home during this time. Main Outcome Measures All subjects were assessed at baseline and 3 months later for fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale), upper extremity strength (digital handheld dynamometer), and propulsion technique (on a treadmill [0.5m/s] with instrumented wheels). Two 1-week bouts of physical activity were measured in both groups from home with wrist-worn accelerometry at the beginning (IG and CG in own wheelchairs) and end (IG in study wheelchair, CG in own) of the 3-month period of home use. Results The intervention was well tolerated, and no adverse events were reported. The IG demonstrated increased strength (P=.008) and a trend toward less fatigue (P=.068), both with large effect sizes (d>0.8), as well as reduced application of braking torque during propulsion (P=.003) with a moderate/large effect size (d=.73), compared with the CG. Conclusions Findings suggest a 3-month physical activity intervention based on manual wheelchair propulsion and training is safe and feasible for some wheelchair users living with MS and may produce secondary benefits in strength, fatigue, and propulsion technique.","Article","10.1016/J.APMR.2015.06.011","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=1532821X&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.apmr.2015.06.011&atitle=Promoting+Physical+Activity+Through+a+Manual+Wheelchair+Propulsion+Intervention+in+Persons+with+Multiple+Sclerosis&stitle=Arch.+Phys.+Med.+Rehabil.&title=Archives+of+Physical+Medicine+and+Rehabilitation&volume=96&issue=10&spage=1850&epage=1858&aulast=Rice&aufirst=Ian+M.&auinit=I.M.&aufull=Rice+I.M.&coden=APMHA&isbn=&pages=1850-1858&date=2015&auinit1=I&auinitm=M","Embase"

This cross-sectional study examined the nature of associations among physical activity, aerobic capacity, and walking performance in persons with MS and healthy controls.METHODS: The sample included 31 persons with MS and 31 controls matched by age, sex, height, and weight. Participants completed the 6-minute walk (6MW), wore an ActiGraph model GT3X accelerometer for 7 days as an objective measure of physical activity (expressed as time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity [MVPA]), and completed an incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer as a measure of aerobic capacity (VO2peak).RESULTS: Hierarchical linear regression analyses indicated that MVPA and VO2peak partially explained group differences in 6MW performance (R = 0.782), although group remained a significant predictor of 6MW performance (β = 0.304; P < 0.001). Path analysis indicated that group had both statistically significant direct and indirect effects on 6MW performance, and the indirect effect operated through pathways involving MVPA and VO2peak.DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: These results provide direct preliminary evidence that physiological deconditioning, perhaps occurring as a result of physical inactivity, may explain variability in walking impairment in persons with MS. These findings support the design and implementation of targeted interventions for improving walking impairment in this population.VIDEO ABSTRACT AVAILABLE: for more insights from the authors (see Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A93).","Article","10.1097/NPT.0000000000000087","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=15570584&id=doi:10.1097%2FNPT.0000000000000087&atitle=Relationships+among+physical+inactivity%2C+deconditioning%2C+and+walking+impairment+in+persons+with+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=J+Neurol+Phys+Ther&title=Journal+of+neurologic+physical+therapy+%3A+JNPT&volume=39&issue=2&spage=103&epage=110&aulast=Sandroff&aufirst=Brian+M.&auinit=B.M.&aufull=Sandroff+B.M.&coden=&isbn=&pages=103-110&date=2015&auinit1=B&auinitm=M","Embase"

BACKGROUND: Mobility impairment impacts the majority of MS patients, yet quantified assessment of walking ability is limited to the clinical setting. Consumer devices can measure number of steps and distance walked on a continuous basis in a patient's home environment. These data could provide potentially important information about the impact of MS on patient mobility over time to supplement office physician assessments. DESIGN/METHODS: 248 members of the PatientsLikeMe (PLM) MS community were recruited to participate in a study deploying Fitbit One™ activity trackers. Devices were mailed to participants with instructions on activation and authorization of data sharing between the manufacturer and PLM. Data were collected for a period of 3 weeks, and patients were asked to complete a survey to provide feedback on their experiences with the device. Information on patient demographics and level of selfreported functional disability were captured from the participant's PLM profile. RESULTS: 82[percnt] of participants linked their activity data with PLM and 77[percnt] of participants completed the end of study survey. MS patients walked an average of 4671 steps/day (SD=2639), and mobility parameters correlated with walking disability severity (r=0.44, p<0.00001) as reported by patients using the MSRS scale.

Recent advances in inexpensive, wireless sensor technology and smart devices are resulting in an explosion of miniature, portable sensors that can quickly and accurately quantify body motion. Practical and useful movement monitoring systems are now becoming available. It is critical that therapists understand the potential advantages and limitations of such emerging technology. One important advantage of obtaining objective measures of balance and gait from body-worn sensors is impairment-level metrics characterizing how and why functional performance of balance and gait activities are impaired. Therapy can then be focused on the specific physiological reasons for difficulty in walking or balancing during specific tasks. A second advantage of using technology to measure balance and gait behavior is the increased sensitivity of the balance and gait measures to document mild disability and change with rehabilitation. A third advantage of measuring movement, such as postural sway and gait characteristics, with body-worn sensors is the opportunity for immediate biofeedback provided to patients that can focus attention and enhance performance. In the future, body-worn sensors may allow therapists to perform telerehabilitation to monitor compliance with home exercise programs and the quality of their natural mobility in the community. Therapists need technological systems that are quick to use and provide actionable information and useful reports for their patients and referring physicians. Therapists should look for systems that provide measures that have been validated with respect to gold standard accuracy and to clinically relevant outcomes such as fall risk and severity of disability.","Article","10.2522/PTJ.20140253","WOS:000350266800017","WoS"

BACKGROUND: 40-70[ percnt] of North American children with MS experience depression or fatigue. PA has been correlated with less fatigue and depression in adult MS. Recently, we found children with MS participated in less strenuous PA than their peers; however, barriers to PA participation are unknown. DESIGN/METHODS: 55 patients aged 8-18 were recruited from the Hospital for Sick Children (20 MS, 35 monophasic demyelination (DM)), as well as 12 healthy controls (CTL). Subjects completed a standard battery of questionnaires, including: PedsQL-MSF, CESDC, PA Self-efficacy Scale (PASES), and the Functional Disability Inventory. The subjects were then given an accelerometer to wear for 7 days and two additional questionnaires (the Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ) and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire) regarding their PA participation. RESULTS: The MS group reported lower PA Self-efficacy than DM (p=0.02) and CTL (p=0.006) and greater functional disability than CTL (p=0.02). No significant differences were found on the selfreport measures of PA. The MS group performed less vigorous PA than DM (p=0.04) as measured by the accelerometer. Within the MS group, PA Self-efficacy correlated with functional disability (r=0.56, p=0.006), walking PA (IPAQ; r=0.62, p=0.002), and light PA (accelerometer; r=0.61, p=0.005). Functional disability correlated with walking PA (IPAQ; r=0.66, p<0.001) and sedentary time (accelerometer; r=0.71, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Children with MS report lower physical activity Self-efficacy, higher perceived functional disability, and perform less vigorous PA than their peers.

Recent North American Research Committee on MS (NARCOMS) research has shown that 85% of participants have access to the internet, and 59% of participants use the Internet as their primary source of MS-specific health information. With over 1 billion Facebook users and 230 million Twitter users, social media and online advertising are potential recruitment tools for research. Objective: To describe social media and online tools used in NARCOMS recruitment. Methods: NARCOMS is a self-report registry for MS with over 37,000 participants. NARCOMS participants complete an enrollment survey followed by semi-annual surveys. About 70% complete surveys online while the rest mail in paper surveys. NARCOMS began using Google AdWords in August 2012 and Twitter (@NARCOMS) in February 2013, and actively pursued collaborations with other MS and neurology outlets to increase online visibility of the registry. Results: Since August 2012, the Google AdWords has been viewed over 260,000 times with 89% of views on search engines outside of Google; 56% were viewed on smartphones. The most common views or clicks on the ad were from: NARCOMS, multiple sclerosis, MS treatment, and MS symptoms in women. In 2015, 43% of new enrollments reported hearing about NARCOMS from the Internet, Twitter, or Facebook. On Twitter @NARCOMS had high-profile Tweets by well-known researchers, media outlets and celebrities living with MS. In 2011-2012, NARCOMS enrollments averaged 2.3 enrollments/day. Since pursuing an online presence enrollment increased to 2.9/day through 2014. In March 2015, after a National MS Society online article, Tweet (@mssociety; 40,000 followers) and a Facebook post with a direct link to NARCOMS, enrollment increased from 5 to 109 in one day, with enrollment averaging 9/day in the week following. One week after a Tweet by Ann Romney (@ AnnDRomney; 202,000 followers) and Brigham and Women's (@BrighamWomens; 20,000 followers) on an article in the magazine NARCOMS Now, Google AdWord views increased from 517/day to 1406, and clicks on the ad increased 200%. 2015 enrollment through March 2015 is 4.9/day.

However, gait variability's link to falls in persons with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS) is not well established. This investigation examined the relationship between stride-time variability, fall risk, and physiological fall risk factors in PwMS. 17 PwMS (62.8±7.4 years) and 17 age-matched controls (62.8±5.9 years) performed the 6-minute walk test. Stride-time was assessed with accelerometers attached to the participants' shanks. Stride-time variability was measured by interstride coefficient of variation (CV) of stride-time. The participant's fall risk was measured by the short form physiological profile assessment (PPA). A Spearman correlation analysis was used to determine the relationship between variables. Increased fall risk was strongly associated with increased stride-time CV in both PwMS (ρ=0.71, p<0.01) and the controls (ρ=0.67, p<0.01). Fall risk was not correlated with average stride-time (p>0.05). In PwMS, stride-time CV was related to postural sway (ρ=0.74, p<0.01) while in the control group, it was related to proprioception (ρ=0.61, p<0.01) and postural sway (ρ=0.78, p<0.01). Current observations suggest that gait variability is maybe more sensitive marker of fall risk than average gait parameters in PwMS.

We investigated which DT paradigm has the greatest impact on spatiotemporal gait parameters (DT cost, DTC) and whether we can discriminate PwMS from healthy subjects (HS). Methods: PwMS and sex-matched HS performed 16 DT paradigms, consisting of walking with and without carrying a cup (WC) during eight different cognitive tasks: subtraction by 3 and 7, digit span (DS) forward and backward, word list generation (WLG) phonemic and semantic, auditory stroop (AS) and clock test (CT). Gait parameters were recorded by wearable sensors. The DTCs of velocity, stride length, cadence, double support and gait cycle were calculated. The Timed Up and Go, Timed-25- Foot-Walk, Six-Minute Walk, Nine-hole-Peg Tests, Brief repeatable battery of Rao, Stroop Test, and Trial Making Test (TMT) were collected.

Ankle mechanical impedance plays a pivotal role at the interface between the neuro-mechanical system and the physical world. This paper reports, for the first time, a characterization of human ankle mechanical impedance in two degrees-of-freedom simultaneously as it varies with time during walking. Ensemble-based linear time-varying system identification methods implemented with a wearable ankle robot, Anklebot, enabled reliable estimation of ankle mechanical impedance from the pre-swing phase through the entire swing phase to the early-stance phase. This included heel-strike and toe-off, key events in the transition from the swing to stance phase or vice versa. Time-varying ankle mechanical impedance was accurately approximated by a second order model consisting of inertia, viscosity, and stiffness in both inversion-eversion and dorsiflexion-plantarflexion directions, as observed in our previous steady-state dynamic studies. We found that viscosity and stiffness of the ankle significantly decreased at the end of the stance phase before toe-off, remained relatively constant across the swing phase, and increased around heel-strike. Closer investigation around heel-strike revealed that viscosity and stiffness in both planes increased before heel-strike occurred. This finding is important evidence of pretuning by the central nervous system. In addition, viscosity and stiffness were greater in the sagittal plane than in the frontal plane across all subgait phases, except the early stance phase. Comparison with previous studies and implications for clinical study of neurologically impaired patients are provided.","Article","10.1109/TNSRE.2014.2346927","WOS:000361317000004","WoS"

However, its underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain poorly understood. Our aim was to assess the potential role of the cerebellum and brainstemstructures in the generation ofMS tremor. We performed accelerometric (ACC) and electromyographic (EMG) assessment of tremor in 32MS patientswithmanual clumsiness. In addition to clinical examination, patients underwent a neurophysiological exploration of the brainstemand cerebellar functions,which consisted of blink and masseter inhibitory reflexes, cerebello-thalamo-cortical inhibition (CTCi), and somatosensory evoked potentials. Tremor was clinically visible in 18 patients and absent in 14. Patients with visible tremor had more severe score of ataxia and clinical signs of cerebellar dysfunction, as well as a more reduced CTCi on neurophysiological investigation. However, ACC and EMG recordings confirmed the presence of a real rhythmic activity in only one patient. In most MS patients, the clinically visible tremor corresponded to a pseudorhythmic activity without coupling between ACC and EMG recordings. Cerebellar dysfunction may contribute to the occurrence of this pseudorhythmic activity mimicking tremor during posture and movement execution.","Article","10.1016/J.JNS.2015.09.360","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=18785883&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.jns.2015.09.360&atitle=Tremor+in+multiple+sclerosis%3A+The+intriguing+role+of+the+cerebellum&stitle=J.+Neurol.+Sci.&title=Journal+of+the+Neurological+Sciences&volume=358&issue=1-2&spage=351&epage=356&aulast=Ayache&aufirst=Samar+S.&auinit=S.S.&aufull=Ayache+S.S.&coden=JNSCA&isbn=&pages=351-356&date=2015&auinit1=S&auinitm=S","Embase"

WBV may potentially stimulate sensorimotor processes. Recent reviews revealed positive effects on muscle force, postural control, pelvic floor, bone density and musculoskeletal complaints. On this account WBV might be important in deconditioned persons such as frailty, patients with musculoskeletal complaints or after stroke, Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis for skilling up. The research focuses on the use of WBV, which is carried out in standing position. But only a few studies examined partial-body vibration (PBV) in sitting position. For this reason a PBV device has been developed for sitting. Purpose: The aim of this single case study was to evaluate trunk muscle activity and acceleration propagation in sitting position during PBV with different vibration parameters. Methods: A vibrating plate with three rotational degrees of freedom was used which lets the operator to choose a rotation axis, amplitude (°), frequency (Hz) and the underlying sinusoidal or stochastic nature of the oscillation. Sinusoidal (S-PBV) and stochastic (ST-PBV) with amplitudes from 0.1° to 1° and frequencies from 1 Hz to 12 Hz were applied in anterior-posterior and medial-lateral direction. Muscle activity (EMG) and acceleration propagation (3-axis accelerometers) during PBV in sitting position in a 26-yearold healthy male were examined. EMG was measured for M. erector spinae (ES, left, height L4), M. obliqus externus abdominis (OE, left), M. trapezius ascendens (TA, left) and M. trapezius descendens (TD, left). Acceleration was captured on the vibrating plate, on the spinal processes of L4 and C7 and on top of the cranium in medial-lateral (ML), in anterior-posterior (AP) and in cranial-caudal (CC) direction. EMG data during vibration was normalized against the activity during maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). Results: AP and ML accelerations were highest on the vibrating plate and continuously degreased up to the cranium. CC accelerations were low on all levels. The highest mean acceleration on the body was observed at L4 during ST-WBV with 18.9 m/s2. In general, ST-PBV resulted in higher mean accelerations but had smaller peak accelerations compared to S-PBV. The ES showed the highest relative mean activations with 2.9-7.3% MVC. AP and ML oscillations determined a slightly higher ES-activation during ST-PBV compared to S-PBV. Conclusion(s): Decreasing accelerations were observed with increasing distance from the vibrating plate due to damping properties of involved body structures. Higher activation of muscles closer to the vibrating plate was found. The decrease in muscle activation was related with a decrease of acceleration (body motion), what is plausible from a biomechanical point of view. Erector spinae muscles seem to invoke higher muscle activation during ST-PBV compared to S-PBV. This effect is similar to recent findings from other authors. We account this to the higher mean accelerations resulting from ST-PBV, in fact higher loads to which the body has to respond. Implications: ST-PBV should be preferred in practice because of two reasons. Firstly, higher mean accelerations can be reached with lower peak accelerations (shocks) and secondly, the resulting muscle activation seems to be higher compared to S-PBV.","Conference Abstract","10.1016/J.PHYSIO.2015.03.556","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=00319406&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.physio.2015.03.556&atitle=Trunk+muscle+activity+and+acceleration+of+the+spine+during+partial-body+vibration+in+a+sitting+position-a+single+case+study&stitle=Physiotherapy&title=Physiotherapy+%28United+Kingdom%29&volume=101&issue=&spage=eS347&epage=&aulast=Eichelberger&aufirst=P.&auinit=P.&aufull=Eichelberger+P.&coden=&isbn=&pages=eS347-&date=2015&auinit1=P&auinitm=","Embase"

Robot-mediated training in a virtual reality context can be applied to enhance rehabilitation of the arm by increasing training intensity. Aims: The aim of the current study was to evaluate upper limb capacity and perception of arm function after individualized adaptive robot-mediated I-TRAVLE training. Methods: In this single arm cohort study, PwMS trained the most impaired arm with the I-TRAVLE system and Haptic Master robot, during eight consecutive weeks at a frequency of five training sessions of twice 30 minutes per 2 weeks. By means of combined quantitative and qualitative assessment, arm function was evaluated at baseline, directly after training and at 3 months of follow-up. In addition to clinical outcome measures at different ICF levels (active range of motion, motricity index, Jamar handgrip strength, Wolf motor function test, ABILHAND and manual ability measure), perceived arm function in terms of fatigue and strength was assessed using a visual analogue scale. Every 2 weeks during training, an interview on motivation, training expectancy and potential training goals was conducted. One month after training, a focus group was organized concerning subjective experience of arm (dys)function, robot-mediated training and changes during and after training. Results: Nine women and four men (aged 22-66 years) with a median Expanded Disability Status Scale score of 6.5 (interquartile range (IQR) 5-7.5) completed the training. Median maximum and sustained active range of motion of shoulder anteflexion increased from 110 (IQR 97-132) to 137 (IQR 112-144) and from 102 (IQR 92-120) to 129 (IQR 100-138), respectively. Other clinical outcome measures on the function level did not demonstrate significant improvement and no changes on perceived performance were reported. However, median perceived fatigue of the arm decreased from 3.6 (IQR 1.8-5.1) to 1.7 (IQR 0.7-5.6) while median perceived strength improved from 3.9 (IQR 3.0-4.6) to 7.4 (IQR 5.1-8.6). During the focus group, patients mentioned increased arm use and improvements in motor control during sustained motor activities. Analysis of robot and accelerometry data confirm these findings. Conclusions: Although not all quantitative measures could demonstrate improvement after training, qualitative analysis showed improved movement performance in daily life. Integrating qualitative and quantitative outcome measures to optimize evaluation of performance seems key.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458515573128","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13524585&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458515573128&atitle=Upper+limb+capacity+and+perception+of+arm+function+in+PwMS+after+8-week+I-TRAVLE+training%3A+A+cohort+study&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=21&issue=4&spage=524&epage=525&aulast=Maris&aufirst=A.&auinit=A.&aufull=Maris+A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=524-525&date=2015&auinit1=A&auinitm=","Embase"

Substantial cost, space, time to administer, and need for trained personnel limit widespread use of biomechanical techniques in the assessment of postural stability in clinical or field environments. Objective: To determine whether accelerometer and gyroscope data sampled from a consumer electronics device (iPad2) provide sufficient resolution of center-of-gravity (COG) movements to accurately quantify postural stability in healthy young people. Design: Controlled laboratory study. Setting: Research laboratory in an academic medical center. Patients or Other Participants: A total of 49 healthy individuals (age = 19.5 +/- 3.1 years, height = 167.7 +/- 13.2 cm, mass = 68.5 +/- 17.5 kg). Intervention(s): Participants completed the NeuroCom Sensory Organization Test (SOT) with an iPad2 affixed at the sacral level. Main Outcome Measure(s): Primary outcomes were equilibrium scores from both systems and the time series of the angular displacement of the anteroposterior COG sway during each trial. A Bland-Altman assessment for agreement was used to compare equilibrium scores produced by the NeuroCom and iPad2 devices. Limits of agreement was defined as the mean bias (NeuroCom - iPad) +/- 2 standard deviations. Mean absolute percentage error and median difference between the NeuroCom and iPad2 measurements were used to evaluate how closely the real-time COG sway measured by the 2 systems tracked each other. Results: The limits between the 2 devices ranged from -0.5 degrees to 0.5 degrees in SOT condition 1 to -2.9 degrees to 1.3 degrees in SOT condition 5. The largest absolute value of the measurement error within the 95% confidence intervals for all conditions was 2.9 degrees. The mean absolute percentage error analysis indicated that the iPad2 tracked NeuroCom COG with an average error ranging from 5.87% to 10.42% of the NeuroCom measurement across SOT conditions. Conclusions: The iPad2 hardware provided data of sufficient precision and accuracy to quantify postural stability. Accuracy, portability, and affordability make using the iPad2 a reasonable approach for assessing postural stability in clinical and field environments.","Article","10.4085/1062-6050-50.2.01","WOS:000365183100003","WoS"

On these bases, we aimed at probing the efficacy of a mental visual imagery (MVI)-based facilitation programme on AM and EFT functioning in the context of a randomised-controlled trial study in RR-MS patients. Methods: Using the Autobiographical Interview (AI), 40 patients presenting with an AM/EFT impairment were randomly assigned in three groups: (i) the experimental (n = 17), who followed the MVI programme, (ii) the verbal control (n = 10), who followed a sham verbal programme, and (iii) the stability groups (n = 13), who underwent the AM/EFT test twice, with no intervention in between. Results: AI's second assessment scores showed a significant improvement of AM and EFT performance only for the experimental group, with a long-term robustness of treatment benefits. Conclusions: The control and stability groups' results ruled out nursing and test learning effects as explanations of AM/EFT improvement. These benefits were corroborated by the patients' comments, which indicated an effective MVI strategy transfer to daily life. Our results suggest that the MVI programme tackles a common cognitive process of scene construction present in AM and EFT.","Article","10.3233/RNN-140461","WOS:000362959900004","WoS"

The MS Performance Test (MSPT), an iPad®-based neurological performance assessment tool, includes walking and balance assessments which exhibited satisfactory psychometric characteristics in a preliminary validation study, but sensitivity to the effects of rehabilitation interventions has not been evaluated. Goals: To determine the validity of using the accelerometer and gyroscope within the iPad to characterize gait and postural instability within MS patients. Methods: 50 MS patients with a clinically observable gait disturbance complete all modules of the MSPT (upper extremity, lower extremity, and cognitive functions), and performance tests of walking (Timed 25 Foot Walk (T25FW), 2 Minute Walk (2MW)) and balance (Functional Reach Test). Data are also collected from computerized gait and balance measurement systems and an activity monitor worn at the waist. Self-report questionnaires include the Patient-Determined Disease Steps, MS Walking Scale- 12, Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) scale, and NeuroQOL. In order to assess sensitivity to change, 15 patients are tested on the same day with and without a walking aid (Hip Flexion Assist Device), and 20 patients return for follow-up assessment after receiving physical therapy. For this preliminary analysis, cross-sectional correlations were assessed, using Spearman rho, between variables derived from the MSPT Walking Speed Test (WST; time, and parameters calculated from acceleration data along 3 axes) and other performance-based and selfreport measures. Results: Data collection has been completed in 10 MS patients (age 53.6 (7.2) years, 60% women, symptom duration 16.1 (6.2) years, 50% relapsing-remitting disease course, 70% using a cane or walker). Strong and statistically significant correlations were observed between MSPT WST variables and the T25FW, 2MW, stride length, the GAITRite® Functional Ambulation Profile score, the Lower Extremity Function NeuroQOL subscale, and the ABC scale (rho 0.68 to 0.9, p 0.04 to 0.001). Conclusions: Our preliminary analysis suggests very good convergent validity between walking parameters derived from the MSPT and clinical, instrumented, and self-report measures of walking, gait, and balance.

Many sensed measures rely on machine learning algorithms to quantify motor ability. ASSESS MS, for example, uses camera-based depth-sensing and machine learning to automatically calculate EDSS subscores for prescribed movements. A substantial challenge in moving sensed measures from lab to clinic is presenting results to clinicians in a way that provides enough context to support clinical decision-making. Visualization of the machine learning process is one way to achieve this. Objectives: To explore appropriate data visualisations for the presentation of results in the ASSESS MS system. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were carried out with nine neurologists, which were subsequently transcribed and coded for analysis. The neurologists were asked to discuss approaches for encoding time and patients' movement properties presented in three visualisations: (1) video of patient outline highlighting the features that most influenced the machine learning algorithm's assessment; (2) image summarizing key properties of the patient's movement that may allow estimating the plausibility of the automated assessment; (3) graph of patient performance over multiple visits without additional details about the current visit. Results: The neurologists preferred the static image over video, as it was easier to compare images than video at different time points. The body was not required in interpreting a visualisation, however, the neurologists liked to be able to “see” the movement in the visualisation, even if not the body parts. There was substantial interest in a prognostic view of the data, but clarity was lacking about what made sense given the unpredictable nature of multiple sclerosis. Conclusions: Preliminary results highlight that ubiquitously sensed measures should aim to be static with a clear relation to movement. Numeric and prognostic views require further exploration.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458515602642","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13524585&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458515602642&atitle=Visualizing+ubiquitously+sensed+measures+of+motor+ability+in+multiple+sclerosis+for+clinical+use&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=23&issue=11&spage=409&epage=410&aulast=Morrison&aufirst=C.&auinit=C.&aufull=Morrison+C.&coden=&isbn=&pages=409-410&date=2015&auinit1=C&auinitm=","Embase"

To determine, (1) the agreement between the standard measurements of MS-related disability [expanded disability status scale (EDSS), functional systems (FS) and ambulation index (AI)] obtained by conventional and remote evaluation using a multimedia platform; (2) the usefulness of monitoring 6-min walk test (6MWT) and average daily walking activity (aDWA) to better characterize patients disability. Twenty-five patients (EDSS score 1.0–6.5) were evaluated every 3 months for the first year, and aDWA repeated at year 2. Remote visits included the recording of a video with self-performed neurological examination and specific multimedia questionnaires. aDWA was measured by a triaxial accelerometer. All but two patients completed the study. Modest agreement between conventional and multimedia EDSS was found for EDSS ≤ 4.0 (kappa = 0.2) and good for EDSS ≥ 4.5 (kappa = 0.6). For the overall sample, pyramidal, cerebellar and brainstem FS showed the greatest agreement (kappa = 0.7). SR-AI showed a modest agreement for EDSS ≤ 4.0 and good for EDSS ≥ 4.5 (kappa = 0.3 and 0.6, respectively). There was a strong correlation between conventional and 6MWT measured by accelerometer (r = 0.76). The aDWA correlated strongly with the EDSS (r = −0.86) and a cut-off point of 3279.3 steps/day discriminated patients with ambulatory impairment. There was a significant decline in aDWA over 2 years in patients with ambulatory impairment that were not observed by standard measurements of disability. MS clinical monitoring by telemedicine is feasible, but the observed lower agreement in less disabled patients emphasizes the need to optimize the assessment methodology. Accelerometers capture changes that may indicate deterioration over time.","Article","10.1007/S00415-015-7764-X","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14321459&id=doi:10.1007%2Fs00415-015-7764-x&atitle=Walking+function+in+clinical+monitoring+of+multiple+sclerosis+by+telemedicine&stitle=J.+Neurol.&title=Journal+of+Neurology&volume=262&issue=7&spage=1706&epage=1713&aulast=Sola-Valls&aufirst=N%C3%BAria&auinit=N.&aufull=Sola-Valls+N.&coden=JNRYA&isbn=&pages=1706-1713&date=2015&auinit1=N&auinitm=","Embase"

However, its practical implementation is not always optimal as it can prove to be very time consuming. Moreover, it often constrains the range of tests used and is not a particularly good marker for patient real life disability status. A mobile application called Digital Self-Assessment for Multiple Sclerosis (DAM) was developed in order to replicate each of MSFC tests available in order to assess MS progression in the patient environment. Objective: To establish a correlation between application DAM and MSFC. Methodology: DAM was created using the Apple open source Research Kit. An ongoing pilot study is currently recruiting 30 patients with an established diagnosis of MS. Patients are selected during a consultation at the Neurology department of the Pitié- Salpêtrière Hospital (France). Each patient is given access to DAM on their own or a provided iPhone. During the enrolment visit, patients have to complete a MSFC and DAM evaluation (V0). Through a push-notification on their phone, patients are reminded to perform two DAM evaluations at home at days 30 (V1) and 60 (V2). At day 90 (V3), they have to come back to hospital for a second MSFC and DAM evaluation. Interim analyses were performed in April 2016 using correlation tests after 24 V0 and 12 V1 were completed. A comparison between each test of DAM and MSFC was done in order to evaluate the reproducibility and robustness of DAM tests. Results: Reproducibility of MSFC on smartphone seems to be excellent (correlation between MSFC V0 and DAM V0 Z-scores, r=0.79, p< 10-5). Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25-FW, r=0.68, p< 10-3) and Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT, r=0.65, p< 10-3) have the best reproducibility. Robustness of DAM seems to be good (correlation between DAM V0 and V1 at day 30, r= 0.68, p< 0.05), particularly for the 9HPT (r=0.77, p< 10-2) and PASAT (r=0.67, p< 0.05). Conclusions: These results reinforce the idea that a smartphone application would be a good self-assessment tool for patients with MS. A new version of the application taking into accounts these interim results is under development. Qualitative insights from patients and clinicians will also be used to enhance usability and clinical relevance with updated or new tests. Further validation will also be required using a larger sample size to improve the confidence level.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458516663081","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458516663081&atitle=A+pilot+study+comparing+the+MSFC+score+to+the+DAM+application%2C+a+self-assessment+solution+for+MS+patients&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=22&issue=&spage=140&epage=&aulast=Medjebar&aufirst=S.&auinit=S.&aufull=Medjebar+S.&coden=&isbn=&pages=140-&date=2016&auinit1=S&auinitm=","Embase"

Biosync Technology AB has developed a technological solution for a wearable device tailored for stress measurement in MS-patients. The biofeedback tool for stress measurement consists of a wristband with biosensors, a mobile application for data visualization and an integrated stress-management solution. The idea behind this biofeedback tool is to increase awareness and improve handling of stress. Goal: To investigate the improvement of quality of life and clinical well-being in RRMS-patients using a wearable device with biofeedback for stress. Methods: A randomized, multi-center, open-label, observational study with RRMS-patients in Sweden. 30 MS-patients on firstline treatment are provided with a wristband with biosensing abilities. Those 30 MS-patients are compared with 30 MS-patients on first-line treatment who do not use a wristband during the study period. Patients with an Expanded Disease Severity Score between 0 to 5.5, aged 18 to 55 years are included in the study. The effect of the wristband will be investigated as an add-on to a first-line treatment. All study subjects are followed for at least 24 weeks. Included patients should have been on first-line treatment for at least six months and a baseline MRI for the treatment according to the usual clinical procedure should have been performed prior to study entry. Last patient in to the study will be last of June 2016. Database closure is expected to be 31st of December 2016. Results: Descriptive summary statistics and frequency counts of demographics and baseline data will be included in the final presentation. Sample size calculation require a total of 60 patients for 80% power and 5% significance level and a drop-out rate of 5%. The primary objective is to determine the effect of wristbandusage and the use of the application for stress-feedback during the study-period of 24 weeks on the patients' quality of life, measured by MS Impact Scale. Conclusion: Based on previous studies, we would expect an improvement in quality of life in the wristband-using group.

Design: Cross-sectional, multi-site, beta trial to test and validate a new technology. Setting: Neurorehabilitation clinics at tertiary care hospitals. Participants: Patients >6mo post acquired brain injury, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis and cerebral palsy. Excluded were patients with orthopedic, rheumatic, or other co-morbidity affecting muscle and joint function. All patients provided signed informed consent before participating. Interventions: N/A. Main Outcome Measure(s): Strength: grip, elbow flexor and extensor, and knee extensor; Range of Motion (RoM): Passive RoM (contracture) and passive-active RoM (paresis); Objective spasticity: Stretch-reflex test for elbow, and pendulum test for knee; Subjective spasticity: Modified Ashworth Scale scores for elbow and knee. Results: Measures were acquired for 103 patients from three rehabilitation clinics. Grip strength correlated significantly with elbow muscle strength (r=.8, p<.001). Strength and paresis were correlated for elbow (r=-.38, p<.001) and knee (r=-.47, p<.001) but neither correlated with contracture. For the knee, objective measures of spasticity correlated with strength (r=.32, p<.001), and subjective spasticity correlated with contracture (r=.26, p=.002). Objective measures of spasticity correlated with strongly with MAS scores for elbow muscles (r=.54 to .82, <.001), but less strong for knee muscles (range: r=.23, p=.01 to r=.52, p<.001). Conclusions: A wearable sensor system can provide valid, objective measures of muscle tone in a clinical setting. Weakness and paresis were related to both objective and subjective clinical measures of spasticity for the elbow, but for the knee there was a weak but significant relationship between subjective spasticity and contracture. Comparison of objective and subjective measures of spasticity suggest the clinical MAS score measures elbow spasticity but may be confounded by contracture for knee extensors.","Conference Abstract","10.1016/J.APMR.2016.09.068","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=1532821X&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.apmr.2016.09.068&atitle=A+toolkit+for+objective+clinical+outcome+measures+of+muscle+tone&stitle=Arch.+Phys.+Med.+Rehabil.&title=Archives+of+Physical+Medicine+and+Rehabilitation&volume=97&issue=12&spage=e25&epage=&aulast=McGibbon&aufirst=Chris&auinit=C.&aufull=McGibbon+C.&coden=&isbn=&pages=e25-&date=2016&auinit1=C&auinitm=","Embase"

Objectives: This study examined the association between rates of energy expenditure (that is, oxygen consumption (VO2)) and accelerometer counts (that is, vector magnitude (VM)) across a range of speeds during manual wheelchair propulsion on a motor-driven treadmill. Such an association allows for the generation of cutoff points for quantifying the time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) during manual wheelchair propulsion. Setting: The study was conducted in the University Laboratory. Methods: Twenty-four manual wheelchair users completed a 6-min period of seated rest and three 6-min periods of manual wheelchair propulsion on a motor-driven wheelchair treadmill. The 6-min periods of wheelchair propulsion corresponded with three treadmill speeds (1.5, 3.0 and 4.5 mph) that elicited a range of physical activity intensities. Participants wore a portable metabolic unit and accelerometers on both wrists. Primary outcome measures included steady-state VO2 and VM, and the strength of association between VO2 and VM was based on the multiple correlation and squared multiple correlation coefficients from linear regression analyses. Results: Strong linear associations were established between VO2 and VM for the left (R=0.93 +/- 0.44; R-2=0.87 +/- 0.19), right (R=0.95 +/- 0.37; R-2=0.90 +/- 0.14) and combined (R=0.94 +/- 0.38; R-2=0.88 +/- 0.15) accelerometers. The linear relationship between VO2 and VM for the left, right and combined wrists yielded cutoff points for MVPA of 3659 +/- 1302, 3630 +/- 1403 and 3644 +/- 1339 counts min(-1), respectively. Conclusion: We provide cutoff points based on the linear association between energy expenditure and accelerometer counts for estimating time spent in MVPA during manual wheelchair propulsion using wrist-worn accelerometry.

The smartphone applications were Health (Apple), Health Mate (Withings), and Moves (ProtoGeo Oy). Results: The Fitbit One had the best absolute (mean = 490.6 steps, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 485.6–495.5 steps) and relative accuracy (1.9% error), and absolute (SD = 16.4) and relative precision (coefficient of variation (CV) = 0.0), for the first 500-step walking trial; this was repeated with the second trial. Relative accuracy was correlated with slower walking speed for the first (r(s) = −.53) and second (r(s) = −.53) trials. Conclusion: The results suggest that the waist-worn Fitbit One is the most precise and accurate sensor for measuring steps when walking on a treadmill, but future research is needed (testing the device across a broader range of disability, at different speeds, and in real-life walking conditions) before inclusion in clinical research and practice with MS patients.","Article","10.1177/2055217316634754","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=20552173&id=doi:10.1177%2F2055217316634754&atitle=Accuracy+and+precision+of+smartphone+applications+and+commercially+available+motion+sensors+in+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.+Exp.+Transl.+Clin.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal+-+Experimental%2C+Translational+and+Clinical&volume=2&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Balto&aufirst=Julia+M&auinit=J.M.&aufull=Balto+J.M.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2016&auinit1=J&auinitm=M","Embase"

Objective The present study aimed to evaluate the Kinect V2 sensor against a gold standard motion capture system with respect to accuracy of tracked landmark movements and accuracy and repeatability of derived clinical parameters. Methods Nineteen healthy subjects were concurrently recorded with a Kinect V2 sensor and an optical motion tracking system (Vicon). Six different movement tasks were recorded with 3D full-body kinematics from both systems. Tasks included walking in different conditions, balance and adaptive postural control. After temporal and spatial alignment, agreement of movements signals was described by Pearson's correlation coefficient and signal to noise ratios per dimension. From these movement signals, 45 clinical parameters were calculated, including ranges of motions, torso sway, movement velocities and cadence. Accuracy of parameters was described as absolute agreement, consistency agreement and limits of agreement. Intra-session reliability of 3 to 5 measurement repetitions was described as repeatability coefficient and standard error of measurement for each system. Results Accuracy of Kinect V2 landmark movements was moderate to excellent and depended on movement dimension, landmark location and performed task. Signal to noise ratio provided information about Kinect V2 landmark stability and indicated larger noise behaviour in feet and ankles. Most of the derived clinical parameters showed good to excellent absolute agreement (30 parameters showed ICC(3,1) > 0.7) and consistency (38 parameters showed r > 0.7) between both systems. Conclusion Given that this system is low-cost, portable and does not require any sensors to be attached to the body, it could provide numerous advantages when compared to established markeror wearable sensor based system. The Kinect V2 has the potential to be used as a reliable and valid clinical measurement tool.","Article","10.1371/JOURNAL.PONE.0166532","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=19326203&id=doi:10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0166532&atitle=Accuracy+and+reliability+of+the+kinect+version+2+for+clinical+measurement+of+motor+function&stitle=PLoS+ONE&title=PLoS+ONE&volume=11&issue=11&spage=&epage=&aulast=Otte&aufirst=Karen&auinit=K.&aufull=Otte+K.&coden=POLNC&isbn=&pages=-&date=2016&auinit1=K&auinitm=","Embase"

To complement patient reports in the elderly, a range of objective performance metrics based on ambulation have been demonstrated as feasible, including the sit-to-stand transition time. These TUG metrics have not yet been applied to multiple sclerosis patients. Methods: Fully-ambulatory persons with multiple sclerosis whose Hauser Ambulatory Index (HAI) was 2 or less (PwMS, N=17) and age-matched healthy volunteers (N=24) were instrumented with 7 inertial sensors with 3 axes of gyroscopy and accelerometry recording at 128 Hz. Participants performed the timed-up-and-go twice, and transition times between sitting and standing were calculated as described previously; in this study we focused only on the data from the sensor placed on the lumbar spine. Results: PwMS reported their walking to be significantly more affected (according to the MSWS-12) than age-matched healthy controls (50.99±4.69 vs. 0, P< 0.001, unpaired t test), and their walking time in the timed 25 foot walk (T25FW) reflected this (6.09±0.27 seconds vs. 4.45±0.15, P< 0.001, unpaired t test). In the stopwatch measured TUG, significant differences were detected between PwMS and age-matched, healthy volunteers, (12.33±0.59 seconds vs. 10.04±0.33, P< 0.01). Similarly, the duration of the TUG as measured by the sensors was longer for PwMS than for the healthy volunteers (13.86±1.09 seconds vs. 10.19 ± 0.36, P< 0.01), and the transition times for sit-to-stand (PwMS 0.81±0.09 seconds vs. healthy 0.67±0.03) and stand-to-sit (PwMS 1.03±0.11 seconds vs. healthy 0.92±0.05) were longer for PwMS, but not significantly (P>0.1 for both). The range of the raw angular acceleration (in the pitch orientation) of the lumbar segment was significantly lower in PwMS (153.4±8.9 deg/second vs. 204.7±6.5, P< 0.001). Conclusions: In this group (HAI< 2), traditional measures of ambulatory dysfunction (e.g. T25FW) are quite sensitive to multiple sclerosis. Wearable inertial sensors have the potential to provide specific metrics of ambulatory dysfunction (e.g. weakness) in MS with good face value. Future studies using these sensors have the potential to realise additional information on movement dysfunction, including specific deficits such as difficulties executing sitting and standing associated with disease progression.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458516663086","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458516663086&atitle=Ambulatory+motor+dysfunction+in+MS+assessed+by+wearable+inertial+sensor+metrics+during+the+timed-up-and-go+task+%28TUG%29&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=22&issue=&spage=667&epage=&aulast=Oberndorfer&aufirst=C.&auinit=C.&aufull=Oberndorfer+C.&coden=&isbn=&pages=667-&date=2016&auinit1=C&auinitm=","Embase"

Rollators are designed to support outdoor mobility and require the user to negotiate curbs and slopes in the urban environment. Despite the prevalence of rollators, analysis of their use outside of controlled environments has received relatively little attention. This Letter reports on an initial study to characterise rollator movement. An inertial measurement unit (IMU) was used to measure the motion of the rollator and analytical approaches were developed to extract features characterising the rollator movement, properties of the surface and push events. The analytics were tested in two situations: first, a healthy participant used a rollator in a laboratory using a motion capture system to obtain ground truth. Second, the IMU was used to measure the movement of a rollator being used by a user with multiple sclerosis on a flat surface, cross-slope, up and down slopes and up and down a step. The results showed that surface inclination and distance travelled measured by the IMU have close approximation to the results from ground truth; therefore, demonstrating the potential for IMU-derived metrics to characterise rollator movement and user's pushing style in the outdoor environment.","Article","10.1049/HTL.2016.0061","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=20533713&id=doi:10.1049%2Fhtl.2016.0061&atitle=Characterisation+of+rollator+use+using+inertial+sensors&stitle=Healthc.+Technol.+Lett.&title=Healthcare+Technology+Letters&volume=3&issue=4&spage=303&epage=309&aulast=Cheng&aufirst=Tsu-Jui&auinit=T.-J.&aufull=Cheng+T.-J.&coden=&isbn=&pages=303-309&date=2016&auinit1=T&auinitm=-J","Embase"

All the subjects were evaluated with the timed 25-foot walking test (T25FW) while wearing a commercially available accelerometer. PwMS also rated the impact of the disease on their walking abilities using the 12-item MS walking scale (MSWS-12). Results All parameters objectively measured, except stride length, were significantly modified in pwMS with higher EDSS, with respect to HC and lower disability participants. Moderate to high correlations (r =0.57–0.79) were observed between gait parameters and MSWS-12 for pwMS of higher EDSS. The correlation was found moderate for the intermediate EDSS category (r =0.42–0.62). Conclusion Wearable accelerometers are a useful tool for assessing gait performance for pwMS in a clinical setting, especially in cases of mild to moderate disability.

Although simple, cheap and easy to administer, timed tests are not able to fully describe the entire set of features of the gait pattern. On the other hand, the use of instrumental techniques may result complex and time-consuming. However, miniaturized wearable inertial sensors are now accessible at a reasonable cost. They might represent a good option for objective quantitative gait assessment in a clinical setting. Aim: The study aims to assess the main spatial-temporal (ST) parameter of gait in pwMS in a clinical setting, using a wireless inertial sensing device and to correlate the results with those obtained by the MSWS-12 scale. Methods: Fifty pwMS (EDSS range 2-6.5) were tested using a wearable inertial sensor previously validated for other neurological diseases. The device was attached at the lower lumbar level and participants walked along a 10-m hallway at a self-selected speed. To evaluate the impact of MS on walking ability, the participants were also requested to complete the MSWS-12 questionnaire. The ST parameters of pwMS were compared with those of a control group (CG) of healthy individuals age and gendermatched. One-way ANOVA was used to assess differences between pwMS and CG, while Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient was calculated to analyze correlation between inertial sensor results and MSWS-12. Results: Mean velocity (1.10 vs. 1.25 m/s), step length (0.31 vs. 0.33 m) and swing phase (35.3 vs. 37.3%) were found significantly reduced in pwMS (p< 0.01 in all cases), while stance phase (64.7 vs. 62.5%) and double support (14.6 vs. 12.6%) resulted higher (p< 0.05). Also, the following ST parameters were found significantly correlated with MSWS-12 score: cadence (r=-0.456, p=0.001), velocity (r=-0.530, p< 0.001), stance phase (r=0.417, p=0.003), swing phase (r=-0.417, p=0.003), double support (r=0.417, p=0.003).

In particular TUG summarizes the ability of an individual to change posture (from sitting to standing) and turn, as well as basic walking performance. This test is simple to administer, characterized by high reproducibility and reliability and is clinically relevant. However, its main limitation is that only the overall time needed to perform is considered. In recent times, inertial sensors have been used in TUG tests for neurological diseases. This approach represents a good option to objectively assess dynamic balance and mobility in a clinical setting. Aim: The study aims to assess the feasibility of use of inertial sensors to assess TUG performance in pwMS. Also, we want to correlate the TUG results with static balance abilities of the participants, quantitatively assessed using stabilometry. Methods: Fifty pwMS (EDSS range 2-6.5) were enrolled for the study. They were tested using a wearable inertial sensor attached at the lower lumbar level. Participants were asked to perform a TUG test, by standing up from a standard chair without arm-rest, walking for 3 m, performing a 180° turning, returning to the chair and sitting on it. The following parameters were investigated: sit to stand (and viceversa) time, intermediate and final turning time. In the same day, a stabilometric test was also carried out. On the basis of the center of pressure (COP) time-series acquired for a 30 s bipedal test, we calculated the following sway parameters: sway area, COP Path Length, COP displacements and velocities in anteroposterior (AP) and mediolateral (ML) direction. Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient was calculated to analyze correlation between TUG and stabilometric parameters. Results: Among the set of TUG parameters, only the duration of the first 180° turning was found significantly correlated with sway parameters (r=0.441 p=0.001 for ML displacement, r=0.491 p< 0.001 for AP displacement, r=0.545 p< 0.001 for sway area, r=0.390 p=0.005 for path length, r=0.471 p< 0.001 for ML velocity, r=0.314 p=0.03 for AP velocity). Conclusions: The results show that instrumented TUG supply information about mobility impairments in pwMS. The existence of correlations with static balance tests (even though limited to a single parameter) show that this technique is potentially useful to assess the effectiveness of the postural control system.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458516663081","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458516663081&atitle=Correlation+between+static+and+dynamic+balance+in+people+with+multiple+sclerosis%3A+Quantitative+assessment+using+inertial+sensor+and+force+platform&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=22&issue=&spage=131&epage=132&aulast=Pau&aufirst=M.&auinit=M.&aufull=Pau+M.&coden=&isbn=&pages=131-132&date=2016&auinit1=M&auinitm=","Embase"

However, most studies to date have investigated the features extracted from movements of the lower limbs and do not provide a holistic gait assessment. A recent pilot study demonstrated that the holistic gait assessment such as evaluating the associations among lower and upper limbs provided better discrimination between healthy controls and PwMS. This paper is motivated by this and further aim to answer the following question: can we identify the temporal gait patterns in terms of the holistic gait assessment? Traditionally this suffers from the statistical property of the causality inference method adopted by previous study. We proposed a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn the temporal and spectral associations among the time-series motion data captured by the inertial body sensors. A simulated model was developed to train the CNN, and then the trained CNN was adopted to assess the gait performance from a pilot dataset with 41 subjects (28 PwMS and 13 healthy controls). Experimental results are reported to illustrate the performance of the proposed approach.","Proceedings Paper",NA,"WOS:000391291200024","WoS"

Participants: Inactive PwMS (n=65) scoring 0 - 3 on Patient Determined Disease Steps, without relapse or change to medications in previous 12 weeks. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measure(s): Demographic data were collected by interview. SCT constructs included: Social Provision Scale (SPS), Exercise self-efficacy scale (EXESE), Multidimensional Outcomes Expectations for exercise scale, Exercise Goal setting, Exercise planning, and Exercise barrier and benefits questionnaires. Mean daily EE was assessed by SenseWear Arm band accelerometer. Results: The only significant correlations (Spearman's rho) with EE were weight (rho=0.561, p < 0.001), disease duration (rho=-0.266, p=0.050), and EXESE (rho=0.361, p=0.005).

Glycosylation changes are accompanied by changes in physiological state, which may be associated with certain types of diseases such as cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, etc. In recent years, this issue has been attracting more and more scientists and enormous advances have been achieved in this field. This work is focused on the use of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) in combination with lectin biosensors and biochips enabling tracking glycosylation and its changes. SPR is commonly used to detect proteins and to study the protein-protein and protein-drug interactions. Lectin SPR biochips additionally allow us to detect the glycan (glycoprotein)-lectin (protein) interactions. The great advantage of SPR, as compared to most other methods used for this purpose, is the possibility of real-time and label-free measurements. On the other hand, the measurement of large number of samples is time consuming. This is possible to overcome by using the SPR imaging (SPRi) techniques allowing simultaneous measurement of several samples. Practical applications of the lectin SPR biosensors and biochips are not only in biology and biomedicine research and diagnosis of diseases and detection of pathogenic microorganisms, but also in environmental monitoring, food control and even in the military for the detection of substances based on glycoprotein toxins.","Article",NA,"WOS:000390899900002","WoS"

Such an approach is favored by the pharmaceutical industry and governmental regulatory agencies as it has a clear statistical basis and overcomes the limitations of the current assays based on the Kawade principle. The work was conducted following the latest assay guidelines. The assays were re-developed and validated as part of the """"Anti-Biopharmaceutical Immunization: Prediction and analysis of clinical relevance to minimize the risk"""" (ABIRISK) consortium and involved a joint collaboration between four academic laboratories and two pharmaceutical companies. The LUC assay was validated at Innsbruck Medical University (LUC(IMU)) and at Rigshospitalet (LUC(RH)) Copenhagen, and the iLite assay at Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm. For both assays, the optimal serum sample concentration in relation to sensitivity and recovery was 2.5% (v/v) in assay media. A Shapiro-Wilk test indicated a normal distribution for the majority of runs, allowing a parametric approach for cut-point calculation to be used, where NAb positive samples could be identified with 95% confidence. An analysis of means and variances indicated that a floating cut-point should be used for all assays. The assays demonstrated acceptable sensitivity for being cell-based assays, with a confirmed limit of detection in neat serum of 1519 ng/mL for LUC(IMU), 814 ng/mL for LUC(RH), and 320 ng/mL for iLite. Use of the validated cut-point assay, in comparison with the previously used Kawade method, identified 14% more NAb positive samples.

Various analysis methods including infra-red spectroscopy, SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, and amino acid analysis have been applied for the characterization of jellyfish collagen and compared with both rat tail collagen and BSA. When comparing the two collagen types derived from jellyfish and rat tail, jellyfish collagen was observed to contain a relatively high amount of glutamic acid (61 residues/1000 residues) and alanine (63 residues/1000 residues) but low amounts of proline (113 residues/1000 residues). On the other hand, pepsin-soluble jellyfish collagen contained a small quantity of tyrosine indicating the purity of atelo-collagen. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is the main analyzing technique of the developed apta-sensor. The proposed apta-sensor has a detection limit of 6.25 nM thrombin. Clinical application were performed with analysis of the thrombin levels in blood and CSF samples obtained from patients with Multiple Sclerosis, Myastenia Gravis, Epilepsy, Parkinson, Polyneuropathy and healthy donors using both the apta-sensor and commercial ELISA kit.

To measure dynamic balance during walking, margin of stability (MoS) examines how the extrapolated center of mass moves relative to the base of support. This study investigates how MoS is affected in PwMS during walking at preferred, slow, and fast speeds, as well as the relationship between MoS and the Expanded Disability Severity Score (EDSS), fall history, and self-report balance confidence questionnaire. MoS was evaluated in PwMS without clinical gait impairment (MS1; n=20), PwMS with clinical gait impairment (MS2; n=20), and age-matched healthy controls (HC) (n=20), in the anterior/posterior (AP) and medial/lateral (ML) direction at heel strike and midstance. In the AP direction, MS2 had a higher MoS than HC (p < 0.001) and MS1 (p < 0.001) at heel strike and midstance. In the ML direction, MS2 had a higher MoS than HC (p < 0.001) at heel strike only. At midstance, slow pace had a lower MoS than preferred pace (p < 0.001) and fast pace (p=0.007). Compared to HC, PwMS walk slower which increases their AP MoS. In the ML direction, slow walking causes lower MoS at midstance, so PwMS increase their MoS by taking wider steps. AP MoS correlated with EDSS (p=0.008) and number of falls (p=0.001), and ML MoS correlated with number of falls (p=0.027). Walking slower, with shorter step length, and with wider step widths increases MoS for PwMS but may be a poor adaptive gait strategy since falls still occur. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Secondary aims were: (1) to compare standardized exercises with relaxation and (2) to compare Pilates exercises with standardized exercises.METHODS: A multicenter, assessor-blinded, randomized controlled trial was conducted. Participants with Expanded Disability Status Scale scores of 4.0 to 6.5 were randomly allocated to groups receiving 12 weeks of Pilates exercises, standardized exercises, or relaxation. Assessments were undertaken at baseline and weeks 12 and 16 (primary outcome measure: 10-Meter Timed Walk Test [10MTW]).RESULTS: One hundred participants (mean age=54 years, 74% female) were randomized to study groups. Six participants relapsed (withdrew from the study), leaving 94 participants for intention-to-treat analysis. There was no significant difference in mean 10MTW measurements between the Pilates and relaxation groups. At 12 weeks, there was a mean reduction of 4.2 seconds for the standardized exercise group compared with the relaxation group (95% confidence interval [relaxation group minus standardized exercise group measurements]=0.0, 8.4) and a mean reduction of 3.7 seconds for the Pilates group compared with the standardized exercise group (95% confidence interval [Pilates group minus standardized exercise group measurements]=-0.4 to 7.8). At 16 weeks, mean 10MTW times for the standardized exercise group remained quicker than those for the Pilates and relaxation groups, although the differences were nonsignificant.

Multiple Sclerosis (MS) symptoms and consequences may influence the low physical activity levels of pwMS. Additionally, Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) variables may also act as modifiable correlates of physical activity (PA) in MS. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine associations between MS symptoms and consequences, SCT constructs and objectively measured Energy Expenditure (EE) as a proxy of physical activity in an inactive sample of pwMS. Methods: Cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from an RCT. Participants were community-dwelling inactive adults (n=65) with a diagnosis of MS scoring 0 - 3 on the Patient Determined Disease Steps. They had not experienced a relapse or change in their medications in the last 12 weeks. Variables included: 5 times sit to stand; Symbol Digit Modalities Test; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; Modified Canadian Aerobic fitness test; six minute walk test; Timed up and go test (TUG); Timed up and go cognitive; MS walking scale 12; MS Impact scale 29; Modified Fatigue Impact scale. SCT constructs included: Social Provision Scale, Exercise selfefficacy scale (EXESE), Multidimensional Outcomes Expectations for exercise scale, Exercise Goal setting, Exercise planning, and Exercise barrier and benefits questionnaires. PA was estimated as mean daily EE from the SenseWear Arm band accelerometer. Results: Spearman's rho correlations indicated that only EXESE and TUG were significantly associated with EE (rho = 0.361, p = 0.005 and rho = -0.268, p = 0.040). The regression model included EXESE and TUG, and explained 11% of the variance in EE (R2 = 0.116, p = 0.033). In this model, only EXESE was significantly associated with EE (EXESE β = 0.292, p = 0.026: TUG β = -0.160, p = 0.212) explaining 9% of the variance (R2 = 0.091). When we controlled for demographic variables the model was non-significant (p = 0.413). Conclusion: In this inactive sample of people with MS volunteering for an exercise trial, SCT variables, MS symptoms and consequences explained very little of the variance in EE as a proxy of PA. The only significant variable was EXESE which confirms the importance of enhancing EXESE through PA interventions. Although TUG was significantly associated with EE it does not seem to be an important contributor in explaining variance in EE.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458516663067","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458516663067&atitle=Energy+expenditure+in+inactive+adults+with+multiple+sclerosis-social+cognitive+theory+and+symptom+correlates&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=22&issue=&spage=825&epage=826&aulast=Uszynski&aufirst=M.K.&auinit=M.K.&aufull=Uszynski+M.K.&coden=&isbn=&pages=825-826&date=2016&auinit1=M&auinitm=K","Embase"

The impact on habitual mobility and its correlation with clinical tests has not been analysed. Objective To investigate the association between clinical response criteria and habitual mobility in MS patients starting a fampridine treatment. Methods During a four-week baseline-to-treatment study, we assessed in 28 patients (median EDSS 4.75, range 4–6.5) walking tests as the Timed-25-Foot-Walk (T25FW) and mobility questionnaires at day 0, 14 (start of treatment) and 28. Habitual steps and distance per day, total activity and walking speed was measured by accelerometry over four weeks. Beside improvement in real-life mobility, we investigated if such measures differed between non-responders and responders defined by a 20% improvement in clinical tests. Results All clinical test, patient reported outcomes and total activity improved significantly (p < 0.05). 46% improved (any change > 0) in three of four real-life measures. Change of the T25FW predicted only an increase of distance per day. Subjective rating of patients performed better by predicting distance and walking speed changes correctly.

Self-reported fatigue is complex and multifactorial, with relatively little known about the causes and impacts among older people. This study tested the association between fatigue and objectively measured physical activity in a large cohort of older adults and identified factors that may explain this association. Methods: Using cross-sectional data from 980 community-living 70- to 77-year-olds, the associations between self-reported fatigue and four physical activity outcomes derived from an accelerometer-based activity monitor were tested. Attenuating effects on the association of age, gender, body mass index (BMI), physical condition, comorbidity, depression, and sleep quality were evaluated. Results: Nine percent of the sample reported being fatigued. Fatigued individuals had 1,150 fewer steps/day, 9 minutes/day less of moderatevigorous activity, 12 minutes/day less of daily activity, and 15% fewer counts/minute, when compared with those not fatigued. BMI, physical condition, and comorbidity attenuated the association, and final regression models including these variables explained most (56%-72%) of the association between fatigue and activity. Conclusions: Fatigue was associated with clinically important reductions in daily physical activity levels of older people. The findings show BMI, physical condition (in particular cardiorespiratory fitness), and comorbidity to be important factors in explaining the fatigue-physical activity association. Modification of these factors may facilitate increases in daily activity levels by lessening fatigue.","Article","10.1093/GERONA/GLV150","WOS:000376398400017","WoS"

The different types of tremor are currently classified according to clinical scales. Unfortunately, this approach is fully subjective in principle. The objective classification is still missing in clinical praxis. Design of a suitable methodology and an evaluation of the method is a subject of this article. Methods: The designed method of objective tremor classification uses a telemetric system with 3-axis accelerometers. A dynamic range of the sensors is set up to ±8g, the signal is sampled with frequency of 50 Hz. These parameters well correspond with expected amplitude and frequency spectrum of the signals showed in the literature (amplitude typically lower than ±2 g, frequency spectrum typically from 2 Hz to 10 Hz, maximally about 18 Hz). Obtained data are stored to a PC in raw format for further processing. Realization: A measuring device is designed as a telemetric device which consists of a wireless sensor unit and a base station. The sensor unit is fitted with microcontroller PIC16F1827 which operates a communication with the accelerometer sensor LIS331DLH (STMicroelectronics). The sensor is placed as a ring on an upper limb. The microcontroller also operates a RF communication with the base station. The communication uses transmitters/receivers in a band of 433 MHz. The base station is connected with the PC using USB. Results: The device was verified in various positions of the sensor by a measuring of the gravity. An usability in the clinical praxis is evaluated in running pilot study. The 31 patients have been measured until now, each patient was measured both with opened and closed eyes, with an arm in resting horizontal position, with an arm in a calm standing position and with an arm during stretching forward. For each record the spectrogram of the signal was calculated (Hamming window length of 128 samples, overlap 121 samples). As it results from completed measurements, the system allows recognition of increased energy both in time and frequency domain in typical bands of 2-3 Hz, 7-10 Hz a 12-14 Hz.","Conference Abstract",NA,"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=18024041&id=doi:&atitle=Frequency+spectrum+pattern+of+postural+oscillatory+movement+in+multiple+sclerosis+using+an+sccelerometer-a+pilot+study&stitle=Ceska+Slov.+Neurol.+Neurochir.&title=Ceska+a+Slovenska+Neurologie+a+Neurochirurgie&volume=79&issue=4&spage=468&epage=&aulast=Rasova&aufirst=K.&auinit=K.&aufull=Rasova+K.&coden=&isbn=&pages=468-&date=2016&auinit1=K&auinitm=","Embase"

Here we present an adaptive filter designed to improve the quality of accelerometer data prior to measuring dynamic pelvic sway patterns during a six minute walk test in people with and without Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Optical motion capture was used as the gold standard. Improved wearable device accuracy (≤4.4% NRMSE) was achieved using gyroscopic corrections and scaling filter thresholds by step frequency. The people with MS presented significantly greater pelvis sway range to compensate for their lower limb weaknesses and joint contractures. The visualisation of asymmetric pelvic sway in people with MS illustrates the potential to better understand their mobility impairments for reducing fall risk.","Article","10.1080/10255842.2016.1140747","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14768259&id=doi:10.1080%2F10255842.2016.1140747&atitle=Gyroscopic+corrections+improve+wearable+sensor+data+prior+to+measuring+dynamic+sway+in+the+gait+of+people+with+Multiple+Sclerosis&stitle=Comput.+Methods+Biomech.+Biomed.+Eng.&title=Computer+Methods+in+Biomechanics+and+Biomedical+Engineering&volume=19&issue=12&spage=1339&epage=1346&aulast=Brodie&aufirst=Matthew+A.+D.&auinit=M.A.D.&aufull=Brodie+M.A.D.&coden=&isbn=&pages=1339-1346&date=2016&auinit1=M&auinitm=A.D.","Embase"

The Dynamic Gait Index (DGI) is a widely used clinical assessment tool measuring dynamic balance. The modified DGI (mDGI [1]) is a recently introduced scoring system which allows a more precise evaluation of the patients' performances. Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) are wearable, low-cost devices which are widely used in balance disorders assessment. The aim of this study was to develop and validate an instrumented version of the mDGI to quantitatively measure dynamic balance. Design: Cross sectional study. Method: Ten people with MS (PwMS) with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) lower than 6.5 and mean age (Standard Deviation) of 49.5 (17.7) years and 10 Healthy Controls (HC) aged 55.1 (13.7) years were recruited. The subjects underwent clinical evaluation with the Timed Up and Go test, TUG, and mDGI. During the assessment of the mDGI tri-axial accelerometry and gyroscopic data were collected by means of a single IMU (X-sens, The Netherlands) positioned on the sternum through an elastic chest strap. For each of the eight mDGI items, a set of quantitative features related to dynamic balance was derived from the acceleration and angular signals. Factor Analysis (Principal Components with Normalized Varimax rotation) was performed on each set, and the main Factor Score (mFS) was extracted and used as a synthetic item performance score. The Instrumented mDGI score (ImDGI) was calculated as the mean of the mFSs of the eight items. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated between clinical (mDGI and TUG) and ImDGI scores. Mann Whitney test was used to assess differences between PwMS and HC. Results: Median (Interquartile Range, IQR) mDGI score of PwMS and HC were respectively 37(13.75) and 64 (1) (P< 0.05). Median (IQR) ImDGI score of PwMS and HC were respectively -0.32 (0.24) and 0.36 (0.16) (P< 0.05). High correlation was found between mDGI and ImDGI (r=0.93), while moderate correlation was found between TUG and mDGI (r=-0.83) and TUG and ImDGI (r=-0.79). Conclusions: These preliminary results suggest that the proposed method can provide a valid, quantitative and objective measure to finely detect dynamic balance disorders in PwMS. A larger sample of subjects will be enrolled to further validate our results.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458516663081","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458516663081&atitle=Instrumented+version+of+the+modified+dynamic+gait+index%3A+A+pilot+study&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=22&issue=&spage=390&epage=391&aulast=Gervasoni&aufirst=E.&auinit=E.&aufull=Gervasoni+E.&coden=&isbn=&pages=390-391&date=2016&auinit1=E&auinitm=","Embase"

However, there is very little known about physical activity participation in older adults with conditions such as MS. This study compared levels of physical activity (i.e., sedentary behavior, light physical activity (LPA), and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA)) and rates of meeting public health guidelines for MVPA (i.e., ≥30 min/day) among young (i.e., ages 20-39 years), middle-aged (i.e., ages 40-59 years) and older adults (i.e., ages ≥60 years) with MS. The sample included 963 persons with MS who provided demographic and clinical information and wore an accelerometer for a 7-day period. The primary analysis involved a between-subjects ANOVA on accelerometer variables (i.e., accelerometer wear time; number of valid days; sedentary behavior in min/day; LPA in min/day; and MVPA in min/day). Collectively, our data indicated that older adults with MS engaged in less MVPA and more sedentary behavior than middle-aged and young adults with MS. Such results highlight the importance of developing physical activity interventions as an effective means for managing the progression and consequences of MS in older adults.","Article","10.14336/AD.2015.1025","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=21525250&id=doi:10.14336%2FAD.2015.1025&atitle=Levels+and+rates+of+physical+activity+in+older+adults+with+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Aging+Dis.&title=Aging+and+Disease&volume=7&issue=3&spage=278&epage=284&aulast=Klaren&aufirst=Rachel+E.&auinit=R.E.&aufull=Klaren+R.E.&coden=&isbn=&pages=278-284&date=2016&auinit1=R&auinitm=E","Embase"

Remote step count monitoring in the patient's natural environment has the potential to enhance the meaningfulness of MS-related disability and disease progression. Commercial-grade accelerometers are inexpensive and patient-friendly, which may allow for longer term continuous recording. Objective: To determine whether average daily step count over 1 month of continuous monitoring measured via a commercialgrade accelerometer (Fitbit Flex) is associated with MS disability in a well-phenotyped prospective cohort. Methods: 80 participants with relapsing or progressive MS from a MS clinic received a wrist worn Fitbit Flex between July 2015 and April 2016. Participants had to be able to walk for at least 2 minutes and were excluded if they had a clinical relapse within 30 days or major physical comorbidities contributing to gait impairment. Participants were instructed to continue normal daily life. Fitbit data were collected using the UCSF Health eHeart electronic study platform and processed through an analytical pipeline for quality control. Baseline testing included the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), Timed 25 Foot Walk (T25FW), Timed-Up and Go (TUG) and the MS Walking Scale (MSWS-12). Results: At 1 month, study retention was 95%, and no devices were lost. Lower average daily step count was associated with greater ambulatory disability as assessed by EDSS (rho = -.71, p< 0.001, adjusting for age and sex). Within each EDSS group there was substantial variability; for example, in EDSS 6.0, average daily step count ranged from 1097 to 7152. Counts were lower in progressive versus relapsing MS (mean difference 2546 steps, p = 0.001). Average daily step count had moderate-strong significant correlations with T25FW (rho = -.65), TUG (rho = - .67) and MSWS-12 (rho = -.65). Discussion: Lower average daily step count, over 1 month of monitoring, was associated with greater MS disability in our prospective cohort of well-phenotyped MS patients with a wide range of ambulatory disability. The use of commercially available monitors is feasible and well tolerated in people with MS and can identify important variability in real-world walking activity within EDSS groups otherwise masked by usual categorization. Continuous step count monitoring may provide a finer scale by which to measure real-world ambulatory improvement, particularly for trials in progressive MS.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458516663081","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458516663081&atitle=Lower+step+count+assessed+using+commercially+available+accelerometry+%28Fitbit%29+is+associated+with+MS+disability%3A+The+FITriMS+study&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=22&issue=&spage=132&epage=133&aulast=Block&aufirst=V.J.&auinit=V.J.&aufull=Block+V.J.&coden=&isbn=&pages=132-133&date=2016&auinit1=V&auinitm=J","Embase"

Lexington, MA), as a measure of gait in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). Design: Validation study. Setting: Research laboratory. Participants: Twenty PwMS (Female=14; age=59.8+/-10.4yrs) participated in the research project. They were divided into groups based on use of assistive devices (n=11 no device; n=9 with device). Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measure(s): The participants completed a timed-25-footwalk, Timed-Up-and-Go, and a series of 6-minute walking bouts. Participants were outfitted with BioStampRC(TM) sensors that house accelerometers and gyroscopes as well as a criterion standard inertial sensor (MTx motion trackers, Xsens, Inc.) on their shins. Shank angular velocity was analyzed offline. Participants completed the timed-25-foot-walk test over a pressure sensitive walkway (Zeno, Protokinetics, Inc.). Stride-number, stride-time, swing-time and step-time were calculated from the various data streams. The group comparisons of gait parameters recorded by each device were conducted with independent t-tests. The gait measurements recorded by BioStampRC(TM) were compared against those recorded by the conventional equipment with paired t-test and Spearman correlations. Results: Performance on the timed-25-foot-walk ranged from 3.92s to 11.42s and was significantly greater in the assistive device group (5.51+/- 1.53 vs 8.17+/-1.74s; p<0.01). Differences in step-time and swing-time were detected between groups (assistance device vs. none) in all tests across all technology (p's0.05). Gait parameters recorded by Bio- StampRC(TM) were strongly correlated with those assessed by the conventional technology (rho's ranging: Stride number=0.86<rho<0.99; Stride time=0.99<rho<1.00; Swing time=0.78<rho<0.84; Step time=0.98<rho<1.00). Conclusions: The results indicate the BioStampRC(TM) motion sensors are a valid measure of gait in PwMS with and without gait impairment.

BACKGROUND: In order to make patient visits more efficient and to learn more about best interventions, patient subpopulations, and other areas of clinical decision making, we introduce an app capable of collecting survey data, continuous physiological data such as activity levels and sleep patterns, and task performance, such as in a 25 foot walk. To enable patient feedback as to the relevancy of survey questions and other metrics we created an app design survey so that patients can give feedback as to whether the data being collected by the investigators is useful, or whether additional data should be collected. DESIGN/METHODS: We created an app design survey that contains questions about which features patients may find useful or enticing for app use. This survey was given out by investigators to clinic patients at the Duke University Neurosciences clinic, where MS patients are seen on an outpatient basis. The survey contained 15 questions and allowed for free text responses from study participants. RESULTS: Preliminary results show that most patients find their smartphones easy to use, and look for health information online. Out of 11 options they are most interested in features involving trackers (symptom, medication, appointment) and the ability to learn more about their MS. They are least interested in features that involve communicating with other people with MS. CONCLUSIONS: The app that we are designing could benefit from additional features such as alerts for new medications, and financial assistance for patients.

"436","Casey B., Coote S., Donnelly A.","Objective physical activity measurement in people with multiple sclerosis: A review of the literature","Multiple Sclerosis",2016,"Background: Current descriptive epidemiology rates of physical activity (PA) levels in people with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) rely heavily on recall-based measurements of PA. Healthy population literature suggests these may lack resolution and places a strong emphasis on the use of objective PA measures in large scale cohort and intervention studies. At present, there is no gold standard objective PA measurement tool for use in MS literature. It is also unclear which aspect of PA MS researchers should be reporting. Objective: 1) To identify the objective PA measurement tools and outputs that are most commonly used within Multiple Sclerosis literature and 2) To determine which PA measurement tools and outputs should be used in future MS and PA research. Methods: A systematic search strategy was conducted on 8 databases (2000-2016) using keywords associated with MS and PA. This review forms part of a more detailed systematic review and meta-analysis that aims to establish current physical activity levels in pwMS. Once the search was complete, information on objective PA devices used and PA outputs reported were extracted and narratively described. Results: This review includes 32 papers of which there are 3 intervention studies, 3 reliability/validity studies and 26 cohort/ case control studies. Uni-axial accelerometers were the most popular objective PA measurement tool in this review (68%). Pedometers (14%) and multi-sensor systems (3%) were the second and third most common devices used. PA outputs included activity counts per day, steps per day, energy expenditure (kilocalories) per day, minutes of moderate-vigorous PA (MVPA), minutes of light PA, minutes of sedentary behaviour and daily dynamic activity. Both activity counts per day (n=21 studies) and steps per day (n=11 studies) were most commonly used representing 78% of the PA output in current literature. Conclusion: Uni-axial accelerometers and pedometers are the most popular PA measurement tools used in MS literature. However, these tools may not be the most accurate measure of PA and other options including multi-sensor systems should be investigated. Additionally, PA is widely being expressed as activity counts and step counts per day. Single metric description of PA may not be accurate. Attention to capturing the duration, frequency, intensity and energy expended during daily PA is warranted.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458516663081","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458516663081&atitle=Objective+physical+activity+measurement+in+people+with+multiple+sclerosis%3A+A+review+of+the+literature&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=22&issue=&spage=399&epage=&aulast=Casey&aufirst=B.&auinit=B.&aufull=Casey+B.&coden=&isbn=&pages=399-&date=2016&auinit1=B&auinitm=","Embase"

However, the neural correlation of walking dysfunction in multiple sclerosis (MS), a key factor for disability, is poorly known. Objective: To evaluate the changes in microstructural integrity of CST, cortical thickness of CST-related areas and volume of brainstem and spinal cord in patients with MS and their association with objectively measured daily activity (DA). Methods: 35 MS patients and 19 healthy volunteers (HV) underwent a 3 Tesla MRI with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and 3D-structural sequences. Probabilistic tractography from brainstem to cortical regions relevant for ambulation was used to reconstruct CST and obtain DTI indices (fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, radial diffusivity and axial diffusivity). Also, cortical thicknesses of CST-related areas, cerebellar cortex, brainstem and C1-C3 spinal cord (SC) volumes were analysed. All subjects wore a triaxial accelerometer for seven days to measure DA in counts per day and completed the international physical activity questionnaire (IPAQ). The Expanded Disability Status Scale score (EDSS) was obtained in patients. Results: MS patients had a median EDSS (range) of 2.0 (0-6.0) and a mean disease duration (SD) of 9.9 (8.6) years. MS and HV did not differ in gender, age, body mass index or IPAQ. Average DA (counts/day) was significantly lower in patients (MS mean [SD]=495,290 [188,030] vs. HV mean [SD]=630,832 [199,377]; p=0.02). MS patients differed from HV in all DTI indices of CST, bilateral superior parietal thickness, left cerebellar cortex, brainstem and SC volume (p< 0.05). In patients, average DA correlated with bilateral cerebellar cortical volume (left: r=0.59, p< 0.001, right: r=0.60, p< 0.001) and brainstem volume (r=0.45, p=0.02).

For wearable devices that actively prevent falls or mitigate their consequences, a critical prerequisite is knowledge on the user's current state of balance. To keep such wearable systems practical and to achieve high acceptance, only very limited sensor instrumentation is possible, often restricted to inertial measurement units at waist level. We propose to augment this limited sensor information by combining it with additional knowledge on human gait, in the form of an observer concept. The observer contains a combination of validated concepts to model human gait: a spring-loaded inverted pendulum model with articulated upper body, where foot placement and stance leg are controlled via the extrapolated center of mass (XCoM) and the virtual pivot point (VPP), respectively. State estimation is performed via an Additive Unscented Kalman Filter (Additive UKF). We investigated sensitivity of the proposed concept to model uncertainties, and we evaluated observer performance with real data from human subjects walking on a treadmill. Data were collected from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) placed near the subject's center of mass (CoM), and observer estimates were compared to the ground truth as obtained via infrared motion capture. We found that the root mean squared deviation did not exceed 13 cm on position, 22 cm/s on velocity (0.56-1.35 m/s), 1.2 degrees on orientation, and 17 degrees/s on angular velocity.","Article","10.3389/FROBT.2016.00011","WOS:000382477000001","WoS"

Study design A total of 68 consecutive patients (27 multiple sclerosis, 41 mono-ADS) and 37 healthy controls completed fatigue, depression, Physical Activity Self-Efficacy Scale, perceived disability, Exercise Goal-Setting scale, and physical activity questionnaires, and wore an accelerometer for 7 days. All patients had no ambulatory limitations (Expanded Disability Status Scale, scores all <4). Results Youth with multiple sclerosis engaged in fewer minutes per day of vigorous (P = .009) and moderate and vigorous physical activity (P = .048) than did patients with mono-ADS and healthy controls. A lower proportion of the group with multiple sclerosis (63%) reported participating in any strenuous physical activity than the mono-ADS (85%) and healthy control (89%) groups (P = .020).

Physical activity (PA) may partially mitigate such injury via its pleotropic effects. In murine models, increased levels of PA have been associated with higher dentate gyrus (DG) volumes (DGv) of the hippocampus. Objective: To assess the relationship between the average number of minutes of moderate-to-vigorous PA per day (MVPA) and DGv in pediatric patients with acquired demyelinating syndromes (ADS) of the central nervous system. Methods: Standardized MRI was acquired from 28 (15 females) pediatric participants with ADS [10 MS, 18 monophasic ADS (monoADS)] within 30 days of a 7-day period of accelerometry wear (7164 Actigraph accelerometer). EDSS and depression scores (CES-DC) were concurrently assessed. Subjects who experienced a relapse or received corticosteroids in the previous 30 days were excluded. Ethics approval was obtained from the SickKids REB. MRI analysis: 3D-T1 images for each subject were linearly registered to the template space. The DG within the hippocampal body and tail was manually traced according to a standardized protocol, yielding DGv normalized by brain size. Brain lesion volume (LV) was measured according to established pipelines. Statistical analysis: The effects of MVPA, group (MS, mono- ADS), sex, age, LV, and the interaction between MVPA and group on DGv were assessed using a general linear model (GLM). We also refit the model with each of EDSS and depression scores replacing LV to assess the impact of these potentially correlated factors. Results: Mean (SD) DGv [cm(3)]: MS 0.339 (0.064), monoADS 0.396 (0.1), p=0.082. Mean (SD) MVPA [minutes]: MS 15.2 (17.1), monoADS 38.8 (28.8), p=0.061. The GLM statistically significantly predicted the DGv, F(5.117), p=0.002, R(2)=0.594, adj. R(2)=0.478. We found a surprisingly strong relationship between DGv and MVPA in the monoADS (0.002 cm(3)/minute of MVPA, p=0.001) but not in the MS group (-0.003 cm(3)/minute of MVPA, p=0.103), which was independent of age, sex, EDSS, depression, and LV. Discussion: We found a relationship between MVPA and DGv in monoADS patients, but not in MS patients. This may have resulted from generally low MVPA in MS patients with limited variation, or from an effect of MS on DGv that cannot be reversed by exercise. Randomized controlled studies are needed to confirm these findings and investigate their relationship to functional outcomes.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458516663081","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458516663081&atitle=Physical+activity+levels+are+associated+with+hippocampal+dentate+gyrus+volume+of+pediatric+patients+with+acquired+demyelinating+syndromes&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=22&issue=&spage=236&epage=237&aulast=Longoni&aufirst=G.&auinit=G.&aufull=Longoni+G.&coden=&isbn=&pages=236-237&date=2016&auinit1=G&auinitm=","Embase"

Main Outcome Measures: Physical behavior was measured using an accelerometer and fatigue was measured by questionnaires (i.e., Checklist Individual Strength, Modified Fatigue Impact Scale). Fatigue questionnaires subscales and physical behavior outcomes were standardized and categorized in dimensions. For fatigue: subjective, physical, cognitive and psychological fatigue; for physical behavior: activity amount, activity intensity, day pattern and distribution of activities. Results: Physical behavior dimensions were significantly associated with only the physical fatigue dimension (omnibus F-test: 3.96, df1 = 4, df2 = 207, p = .004). Additional analysis showed that activity amount (B= -0.16, 95% CI = -0.27 to -0.04, p = .007), activity intensity (B= -0.18, 95% CI= -0.31 to -0.06, p= .004) and day pattern (B= -0.17, 95% CI = -0.28 to -0.06, p = .002) were the physical behavior dimensions that were significantly associated with physical fatigue. Age and gender did not confound these associations. Conclusions: Physical behavior is weakly associated with physical fatigue and not with other fatigue dimensions, such as cognitive and psychological. This supports the notion that fatigue is multidimensional, and may imply that different treatment modalities should be considered in the treatment of fatigue.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458516663081","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458516663081&atitle=Physical+behavior+is+associated+with+physical+fatigue+in+persons+with+multiple+sclerosis+related+fatigue&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=22&issue=&spage=394&epage=395&aulast=Van+Meeteren&aufirst=J.&auinit=J.&aufull=Van+Meeteren+J.&coden=&isbn=&pages=394-395&date=2016&auinit1=J&auinitm=","Embase"

Our objectives are: (1) to use IMU array data to calculate metrics that quantify performance (speed and stability) and (2) to investigate the effects of load on performance. We hypothesize that added load significantly decreases subject speed yet results in increased stability of subject movements. We propose and evaluate five performance metrics: (1) time to cross beam (less time = more speed), (2) percentage of total time spent in double support (more double support time = more stable), (3) stride duration (longer stride duration = more stable), (4) ratio of sacrum M-L to A-P acceleration (lower ratio = less lateral balance corrections = more stable), and (5) M-L torso range of motion (smaller range of motion = less balance corrections = more stable). We find that the total time to cross the beam increases with load (t = 4.85, p < 0.001). Stability metrics also change significantly with load, all indicating increased stability. In particular, double support time increases (t = 6.04, p < 0.001), stride duration increases (t = 3.436, p = 0.002), the ratio of sacrum acceleration RMS decreases (t = -5.56, p < 0.001), and the M-L torso lean range of motion decreases (t = -2.82, p = 0.009). Overall, the IMU array successfully measures subject movement and gait parameters that reveal the trade-off between speed and stability in this highly dynamic balance task. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This study explored the relationship between acceleration patterns at the trunk and at the foot during treadmill walking at self-selected pace in healthy adults. Forty healthy subjects walked on a treadmill for 3 minutes at self-selected speed. Root mean square (RMS) and approximate entropy (ApEn) were derived from the acceleration time series at the trunk and at the foot in the frontal and sagittal plane. RMS of accelerations at the trunk were strongly correlated with RMS values at the foot in the sagittal plane (r = 0.883, p < 0.01) and in the frontal plane (r = 0.811, p < 0.01). ApEn values at the trunk were moderately correlated with ApEn values at the foot in the sagittal plane (r = 0.603, p < 0.01) only. These results show that acceleration variability at the foot is related to acceleration variability at the trunk, specifically that increased variability at the foot is tied to increased variability at the trunk in healthy adults. Portable inertial sensors can potentially be used in any environment including a laboratory, clinic, or at home to measure lower and upper body segment motion, and assessing relationships between upper and lower body motion may provide a more comprehensive evaluation of overall stability.

We focused on the number of days required to reliably estimate sedentary behavior, based on time spent in sedentary behavior per day and number of sedentary breaks, number of long sedentary bouts, and average length of sedentary bouts per day. We further examined the number of days required to reliably estimate physical activity behavior, based on time spent in light and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and average length of activity bouts per day. Between 4-6 days of monitoring and 3-7 days of monitoring were necessary for good reliability of scores from all sedentary outcomes and physical activity outcomes, respectively.

However the impact of MAG activation in OLS remains elusive. We studied the effect of antibody-mediated MAG activation in OLS using a well characterized anti-MAG mAb that induces MAG crosslinking/activation of intracellular signaling. Methods: A MOG-induced animal model of chronic inflammatory demyelination characterized by the presence of extensive axonal degeneration and OLs cultures (primary or derived from CG4 cell line) were used to study the role of extracellular glutamate (Glu) uptake induced by antibody-mediated activation of MAG at the cell membrane of OLs. Monitoring of Glu concentrations in OL cultures was studied by using Föster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based Glu biosensors. Results: We found that in primary OLs cultures mAb-mediated MAG activation induce: i) increase resistance to oxidative stress caused by Glu overload, ii) increase Glu uptake by OLs measured by Glu biosensors with differential cellular expression, iii) activates antioxidant defenses associated with a PKC-dependent activation/translocation of nuclear factor erythroid-related factor 2 to the nucleus analyzed by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy, iv) increase the levels of reduced glutathione (GSH), the main cellular antioxidant element in a Xc- cysteine/ Glu antiporter and Glu transporters-dependent manner and v) dramatically increase neuronal and glial survival exposed to Glu overload in cerebellar organotypic cultures. The impact of mAbmediated MAG activation was then analyzed in the animal model of EAE induced by MOG. Compared to IgG isotypematched control groups, intraperitoneal treatment with anti- MAG mAb prior to disease onset significantly delays the onset of clinical symptoms, ameliorates clinical expression of the disease, reduce axonal damaged of myelinated sensory axons from spinal cord (analyzed by electron microscopy) and reduce the amount of IL-17 secreted by peripheral mononuclear cells. Conclusion: these results allow us to propose OLs as critical modulators of high extracellular Glu concentration in white matter. This event results critical toward understanding demyelination- associated axonal damaged induced by Glu toxicity, opening a new opportunity for therapeutic intervention in MS.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458516663086","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458516663086&atitle=Revealing+neuroprotective+properties+of+axon-myelin+interactions%3A+Its+impact+on+glutamate-mediated+axonal+damage+in+MS&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=22&issue=&spage=630&epage=&aulast=Viinetto&aufirst=A.L.&auinit=A.L.&aufull=Viinetto+A.L.&coden=&isbn=&pages=630-&date=2016&auinit1=A&auinitm=L","Embase"

Additionally, smartwatches are experiencing greater social acceptability, even among the elderly. While step counting is an essential parameter to calculate the user's spatial activity, current detection algorithms are insufficient for calculating steps when using a rollator, which is a common walking aid for elderly people. Through a pilot study conducted with eight different wrist-worn smart devices, an overall recognition of similar to 10% was achieved. This is because characteristic motions utilized by step counting algorithms are poorly reflected at the user's wrist when pushing a rollator. This issue is also present among other spatial activities such as pushing a pram, a bike, and a shopping cart. This paper thus introduces an improved step counting algorithm for wrist-worn accelerometers. This new algorithm was first evaluated through a controlled study and achieved promising results with an overall recognition of similar to 85%. As a follow-up, a preliminary field study with randomly selected elderly people who used rollators resulted in similar detection rates of similar to 83%.

Additionally, physical activity levels are less in MS than normal people. No previous studies were conducted to investigate the impact of physical activity on sleep deficits in patients with MS. This study was conducted to assess sleep deficits and sleep biomarkers dysregulation and its relation to physical activity in people with MS. Design and Methods: We assessed 60 subjects with diagnosis of MS. The main parameters of this study were levels of physical activities which were estimated using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire and objectively using the Actigraph accelerometers, sleep characteristics objectively using Actisleep and subjectively by Pittsburg sleep quality index, and fatigue using current and modified fatigue impact scales. Morning serum melatonin and cortisol levels were assessed by mean of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The expanded disease severity scale assessed level of disease severity. Results: Results of this study showed negative correlations between vector magnitude counts per minutes (VMCPM), measured by Actigraph, and both wake after sleep onset (WASO) and average awakenings (AA), measured by Actisleep. Moreover, we found positive correlation between VMCPM and sleep efficiency. In addition, steps per minutes were negatively correlated with WASO and AA. Both melatonin and cortisol were negatively correlated with sedentary activity in patients with MS. Conclusions: Physical activity was found to be associated with sleep efficiency in patients with MS, which could be related to sleep biomarkers in this population. This finding provides the suggestion that exercise could help in improving quality of life as an adds-on therapy for sleep deficits in MS patients. Further researches are needed to examine the effects of exercise and physical activity programs on cortisol and melatonin levels in MS population.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458516635979","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458516635979&atitle=The+association+between+physical+activity+and+sleep+deficits+and+biomarkers+in+patients+with+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=22&issue=6&spage=NP15&epage=NP16&aulast=Aburub&aufirst=Aseel&auinit=A.&aufull=Aburub+A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=NP15-NP16&date=2016&auinit1=A&auinitm=","Embase"

Vibrotactile biofeedback of trunk sway has been shown to improve balance control in patients with peripheral and central vestibular disorders. Objective: To measure the effects of vibrotactile feedback training on trunk sway in MS during different stance and gait tasks. Methods: In total, 10 MS patients(6 relapsing-remitting, 2 secondary-progressive and 2 primary-progressive MS, mean age 46.8 ± 7.7 years, 40% male, median EDSS 4.0[range 2.5 - 6.0]) with complaints of balance impairment participated in a randomized controlled crossover study in which 7 different stance and gait tasks were trained with and without sway angular feedback for stance and sway angular velocity feedback for gait tasks. Dizziness Handicap Inventory(DHI) questionnaires were used to measure the subjective balance deficits. The 12-item MS walking scale(MSWS-12) was used to measure the impact of MS on subject's walking ability. An assessment sequence of 12 stance and gait tasks was performed once before and twice after the training sequence including standing one or two legs with eyes open and closed on a firm or foam surface, tandem stance eyes open and closed, walking 8 tandem steps eyes open and closed, walking over barriers, walking 8 m eyes open and 3m eyes closed. Trunk sway was measured with body-worn gyroscopes mounted near the body's centre of mass, in the centre of the lower back at vertebral level L3-L5. Head mounted vibrotactile biofeedback of lower trunk sway was provided during one crossover training arm and the following second but not the third assessment sequence. Results: Mean DHI and MSWS-12 scores were 30.0±15.9 and 28.9±12.8, respectively. In most tasks, biofeedback led to a marginal decrease in sway and increase in sway angular velocities for stance tasks and vice versa for gait tasks when compared to training without biofeedback. For example, walking eyes open resulted in a decreased sway angular velocity. The greatest changes during gait were found in the pitch direction of trunk sway (-13.87±6.03 degree/sec, p=0.02).

Methods Ten MS patients (mean age 46.8±7.7 years, 40% male) participated in a crossover study in which 7 different stance and gait tasks were trained with and without angle feedback for stance and angular velocity feedback for gait. An assessment sequence of 12 tasks was performed once before and twice after the training sequence. Trunk sway was measured with body-worn gyroscopes. Head mounted vibrotactile biofeedback of trunk sway was provided during one crossover training arm and the following second assessment sequence. Results Biofeedback generally leads to a decrease in sway but an increase in sway angular velocities during some stance tasks compared to training without biofeedback. Biofeedback while walking eyes open resulted in a decreased sway angular velocity. The greatest changes were found in the pitch direction of trunk sway. Effects diminished after biofeedback was removed. Conclusions This study showed that vibrotactile biofeedback of trunk sway beneficially effects stance and provides significant improvement in gait compared to training without biofeedback in MS patients.","Article","10.1016/J.MSARD.2016.05.003","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=22110356&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.msard.2016.05.003&atitle=The+effect+of+vibrotactile+biofeedback+of+trunk+sway+on+balance+control+in+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+Relat.+Disord.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+and+Related+Disorders&volume=8&issue=&spage=58&epage=63&aulast=Van+Der+Logt&aufirst=R.P.&auinit=R.P.&aufull=Van+Der+Logt+R.P.&coden=&isbn=&pages=58-63&date=2016&auinit1=R&auinitm=P","Embase"

Clinical Questions (1) When used as an assistive device, do wearable exoskeletons improve lower extremity function or gait compared with knee-ankle-foot orthoses (KAFOs) in patients with complete or incomplete spinal cord injury? (2) When used as a rehabilitation device, do wearable exoskeletons improve lower extremity function or gait compared with other rehabilitation strategies in patients with complete or incomplete spinal cord injury? (3) When used as an assistive or rehabilitation device, are wearable exoskeletons safe compared with KAFO for assistance or other rehabilitation strategies for rehabilitation in patients with complete or incomplete spinal cord injury? Methods PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase databases and reference lists of key articles were searched from database inception to May 2, 2016, to identify studies evaluating the effectiveness of wearable exoskeletons used as assistive or rehabilitative devices in patients with incomplete or complete spinal cord injury. Results No comparison studies were found evaluating exoskeletons as an assistive device. Nine comparison studies (11 publications) evaluated the use of exoskeletons as a rehabilitative device. The 10-meter walk test velocity and Spinal Cord Independence Measure scores showed no difference in change from baseline among patients undergoing exoskeleton training compared with various comparator therapies. The remaining primary outcome measures of 6-minute walk test distance and Walking Index for Spinal Cord Injury I and II and Functional Independence Measure-Locomotor scores showed mixed results, with some studies indicating no difference in change from baseline between exoskeleton training and comparator therapies, some indicating benefit of exoskeleton over comparator therapies, and some indicating benefit of comparator therapies over exoskeleton. Conclusion There is no data to compare locomotion assistance with exoskeleton versus conventional KAFOs. There is no consistent benefit from rehabilitation using an exoskeleton versus a variety of conventional methods in patients with chronic spinal cord injury. Trials comparing later-generation exoskeletons are needed.","Review","10.1055/S-0036-1593805","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=21925690&id=doi:10.1055%2Fs-0036-1593805&atitle=The+Effectiveness+and+Safety+of+Exoskeletons+as+Assistive+and+Rehabilitation+Devices+in+the+Treatment+of+Neurologic+Gait+Disorders+in+Patients+with+Spinal+Cord+Injury%3A+A+Systematic+Review&stitle=Global+Spine+J.&title=Global+Spine+Journal&volume=6&issue=8&spage=822&epage=841&aulast=Fisahn&aufirst=Christian&auinit=C.&aufull=Fisahn+C.&coden=&isbn=&pages=822-841&date=2016&auinit1=C&auinitm=","Embase"

Foot sensation plays an important role in keeping the body balanced whilst walking; however, people with multiple sclerosis often have poor sensation on the soles of their feet. Wearing a specially designed shoe insole, which enhances plantar sensory information, could help people with multiple sclerosis to walk better. This study will explore whether long-term wear of a textured insole can improve walking in people with multiple sclerosis. Methods: A prospective randomised controlled trial with two parallel groups will be conducted aiming to recruit 176 people with multiple sclerosis living in the community (Brisbane, Australia). Adults with a clinical diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, Disease Steps score 1-4, who are ambulant over 100 m and who meet specific inclusion criteria will be recruited. Participants will be randomised to a smooth control insole (n = 88) or textured insole (n = 88) group. The allocated insole will be worn for 12-weeks within participants' own footwear, with self-report wear diaries and falls calendars being completed over this period. Blinded assessors will conduct two baseline assessments and one post-intervention assessment. Gait tasks will be completed barefoot, wearing standardised footwear only, and wearing standardised footwear with smooth and textured insoles. The primary outcome measure will be mediolateral base of support when walking over even and uneven surfaces. Secondary measures include spatiotemporal gait parameters (stride length, stride time variability, double-limb support time, velocity), gait kinematics (hip, knee, and ankle joint angles, toe clearance, trunk inclination, arm swing, mediolateral pelvis/head displacement), foot sensation (light touch-pressure, vibration, two-point discrimination) and proprioception (ankle joint position sense). Group allocation will be concealed and all analyses will be based on an intention-to-treat principle. Discussion: This study will explore the effects of wearing textured insoles over 12-weeks on gait, foot sensation and proprioception in people with multiple sclerosis. The study has the potential to identify a new, evidence-based footwear intervention which has the capacity to enhance mobility and independent living in people with multiple sclerosis.","Article","10.1186/S13063-016-1337-X","WOS:000374516500001","WoS"

The assessment of the functional performance status of persons with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) is a useful tool to optimize healthcare. This concept does not seem to be extensively explored in this population [1,2]. This study aimed to determine the level of activity of PwMS during weekdays and weekends, and to establish associations between clinical and functional parameters and this level of physical activity. Materials/patients and methods 41 PwMS and 16 healthy persons participated in this study. Their physical activity in real-life condition was assessed with an accelerometer ActiGraph (wGT3X) for 7 days. For the clinical and functional evaluations, the EDSS disability scale, quality of life, fatigue, gait, six-minute walk test (6MWT) and timed up and go TEST (TUG) were assessed. Groups were compared in terms of accelerometry, using a student's t test. In order to verify the relationship between clinical and functional parameters and the level of real-life activity, person's correlation tests were conducted. Results The level of activity between PwMS for weekdays, weekends, Saturdays and Sundays was significant smaller compared with the healthy group (p = [10.3-10.5], d = [0.95-1.76]). PwMS had a constant level of activity throughout the week, whereas the healthy group increased its level of activity on Saturdays (p = 0.04, d = 0.69). The level of activity was correlated in descending order with EDSS score, body mass index, and gait velocity at fast condition, 6MWT and TUG. Discussion/conclusion This study showed that PwMS during the week performed less activity than their healthy peers. They had a stable level of activity throughout the week, contrary to healthy persons. More information is required to determine if it involves a patient's coping mechanism (performance < the maximal capacity) or a limitation in performance (performance≈to the maximal capacity). It could be necessary to develop programs to facilitate physical activity and participation during the weekdays, but especially during weekends.","Conference Abstract","10.1016/J.REHAB.2016.07.092","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=18770665&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.rehab.2016.07.092&atitle=The+functional+performance+status+during+weekdays+and+weekends+in+persons+with+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Ann.+Phys.+Rehabil.+Med.&title=Annals+of+Physical+and+Rehabilitation+Medicine&volume=59&issue=&spage=e40&epage=&aulast=Sagawa&aufirst=Yoshimasa&auinit=Y.&aufull=Sagawa+Y.&coden=&isbn=&pages=e40-&date=2016&auinit1=Y&auinitm=","Embase"

Various studies for oral drugs have shown that efficient therapy handling and adherence is not guaranteed. Though oral therapies lack the barrier of self-injection, medications like delayed-release dimethyl fumarate (DMF; also known as gastro-resistant DMF) have challenges. Objective of this retrospective study is to evaluate the real-world experience for patients on DMF for up to 24 months. Furthermore, the potential benefit of individual patient coaching is analysed. Methods: Recruitment, still ongoing, was started in Feb 2014. All patients signed an informed consent form and received a code for a smartphone application with reminder function. Coached patients were in contact by phone at least 2 times in the 1st therapy month with the personal coach. After the 1st month contents and coaching frequency were adapted according to patient needs including motivational interviewing and compliance coaching. The control cohort of uncoached patients was contacted 1-2 times per year. Results: As of February 2016, 9064 patients taking DMF have been recruited. After median follow up of 16 months, data for 8102 DMF patients including 1884 dropouts were analyzed. While 24% were newly diagnosed, 65.2% switched from standard disease modifying therapies, 10.8% got the prescription for DMF receiving a 2nd line escalation therapy like Natalizumab before. Overall, gastrointestinal (GI) events were reported as the most frequent reason for discontinuation (28.6%), followed by ongoing disease activity (16%), changes in blood counts (13.9%) and flushing/pruritus (9.9%). GI events were most frequently reported in the first three months of therapy, incidence declines in the ongoing months. Reasons and timing to therapy discontinuation differed for coached and control patients. 5.7%, 17.4% and 21.9% of coached patients stopped therapy after 3, 12 and 18 months compared to 10.1%, 24.7% and 33.4% of the controls, respectively. Patients in the control cohort tended to discontinue therapy more often because of partly manageable side effects such as GI events and flushing/pruritus. Conclusions: Side effects reported in the phase III studies are also the main reasons for discontinuing DMF therapy in the real-world setting. Patient coaching provides essential contribution to overcome preventable or manageable tolerability issues and may drive regular blood count controls.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458516663086","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458516663086&atitle=The+potential+of+individualized+patient+coaching+to+optimize+treatment+with+delayed-release+dimethyl+fumarate%3A+A+retrospective+analysis+of+patients+with+multiple+sclerosis+treated+in+a+real-world+setting&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=22&issue=&spage=636&epage=637&aulast=Begus-Nahrmann&aufirst=Y.&auinit=Y.&aufull=Begus-Nahrmann+Y.&coden=&isbn=&pages=636-637&date=2016&auinit1=Y&auinitm=","Embase"

However, such instruments tend to be expensive and require expert operation and maintenance besides their high cost, thus limiting them to only a small number of specialized centers. Consequently, gait analysis in most clinics today still relies on observation-based assessment. Recent advances in wearable sensors, especially inertial body sensors, have opened up a promising future for gait analysis. Not only can these sensors be more easily adopted in clinical diagnosis and treatment procedures than their current counterparts, but they can also monitor gait continuously outside clinics - hence providing seamless patient analysis from clinics to free-living environments. The purpose of this paper is to provide a systematic review of current techniques for quantitative gait analysis and to propose key metrics for evaluating both existing and emerging methods for qualifying the gait features extracted from wearable sensors. It aims to highlight key advances in this rapidly evolving research field and outline potential future directions for both research and clinical applications.","Review","10.1109/JBHI.2016.2608720","WOS:000389846700008","WoS"

A Randomized Parallel Group Trial","Physiotherapy research international : the journal for researchers and clinicians in physical therapy",2016,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The most effective treatment approach to improve walking in people with multiple sclerosis (MS) is not known. The aim of this trial was to assess the efficacy of treadmill training and progressive strength training on walking in people with MS.METHODS: A single blinded randomized parallel group trial was carried out. Eligible participants were adults with MS with Expanded Disability Status Scale score ≤6. A total of 29 participants were randomized and 28 received the allocated exercise intervention, treadmill (n = 13) or strength training (n = 15). Both groups exercised 30 minutes, three times a week for 8 weeks. Primary outcome was The Functional Ambulation Profile evaluated by the GAITRite walkway. Secondary outcomes were walking work economy and balance control during walking, measured by a small lightweight accelerometer connected to the lower back. Testing was performed at baseline and the subsequent week after completion of training.RESULTS: Two participants were lost to follow-up, and 11 (treadmill) and 15 (strength training) were left for analysis. The treadmill group increased their Functional Ambulation Profile score significantly compared with the strength training group (p = .037). A significant improvement in walking work economy (p = .024) and a reduction of root mean square of vertical acceleration (p = .047) also favoured the treadmill group.DISCUSSION: The results indicate that task-specific training by treadmill walking is a favourable approach compared with strength training to improve walking in persons with mild and moderate MS.

Background: Frequency as a property of tremor is a vital piece of information for the differential diagnosis of tremor disorders. Assessing frequency by observation alone is approximate at best, and this is usually combined with EMG measurements and accelerometry. One study suggested that one application (iSeismometer® ) through the use of the iPhone® in-built triaxial accelerometer could reliably assess tremor on the-go, since the values obtained by the application matched well with EMG analysis(1). There are several tremordetection applications available for the iPhone but few studies have addressed them. Methods: We selected three applications that had previously been mentioned on the literature (LiftPulse® , iSeismometer® , Studymytremor® ) (2). Twenty-two patients were included (twelve with Parkinson's disease (PD), nine with essential tremor (ET), one with Holmes tremor due to multiple sclerosis). The first author's personal iPhone® (iPhone 5s) was strapped securely to the patient's tremorous limb. PD patients were assessed on the rest position and ET and Holmes tremor on posture. EMG needle assessment as well as accelerometry was subsequently performed on a Nicolet Viking Select® and accelerometry analysis was performed in Viking Select Tremor Master Software v8.3. Results: Average tremor frequency for PD was 4.5Hz and for TE 7.2Hz. Pearson correlation showed very strong correlation between the three applications, the EMG needle assessment and the accelerometry (Pearson>0.8, p<0.001). There was no statistically significant difference between the three aplications and the EMG. Conclusions: Our data suggests that any of the applications tested - Liftpulse® , Studymytremor® , iSeismometer® - present a reliable and easy to use method for tremor frequency calculation and constitute a valid alternative to EMG analysis.","Conference Abstract","10.1002/MDS.26688","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=15318257&id=doi:10.1002%2Fmds.26688&atitle=Tremor+frequency+by+iPhone%C2%AE+applications%3A+Correlation+with+EMG+analysis&stitle=Mov.+Disord.&title=Movement+Disorders&volume=31&issue=&spage=S317&epage=&aulast=Ara%C3%BAjo&aufirst=R.&auinit=R.&aufull=Ara%C3%BAjo+R.&coden=&isbn=&pages=S317-&date=2016&auinit1=R&auinitm=","Embase"

The purpose of this study was to assess the validity of a body-worn inertial sensor system (RehaGait (R)) for measuring spatiotemporal gait characteristics compared to a stationary treadmill (Zebris) and the reliability of both systems at different walking speeds and slopes. Methods: Gait analysis was performed during treadmill walking at different speeds (habitual walking speed (normal speed); 15 % above normal walking speed; 15 % below normal walking speed) and slopes (0 % slope; 15 % slope) in 22 healthy participants twice 1 week apart. Walking speed, stride length, cadence and stride time were computed from the inertial sensor system and the stationary treadmill and compared using repeated measures analysis of variance. Effect sizes of differences between systems were assessed using Cohen's d, and limits of agreement and systematic bias were computed. Results: The RehaGait (R) system slightly overestimated stride length (+2.7 %) and stride time (+0.8 %) and underestimate cadence (-1.5 %) with small effect sizes for all speeds and slopes (Cohen's d <= 0.44) except slow speed at 15 % slope (Cohen's d > 0.80). Walking speed obtained with the RehaGait (R) system closely matched the speed set on the treadmill tachometer. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were excellent for speed, cadence and stride time and for stride length at normal and fast speed at 0 % slope (ICC:.91-1.00). Good ICC values were found for stride length at slow speed at 0 % slope and all speeds at 15 % slope (ICC:.73-.90). Both devices had excellent reliability for most gait characteristics (ICC:.91-1.00) except good reliability for the RehaGait (R) for stride length at normal and fast speed at 0 % slope and at slow speed at 15 % slope (ICC:.80-.87). Conclusions: Larger limits of agreement for walking at 15 % slope suggests that uphill walking may influence the reliability of the RehaGait (R) system. The RehaGait (R) is a valid and reliable tool for measuring spatiotemporal gait characteristics during level and inclined treadmill walking.","Article","10.1186/S12984-016-0115-Z","WOS:000368392500002","WoS"

Compared with MSFC, SaGAS 10 can be less burdensome (due to the omission of PASAT-3) and requires no rescaling to a standard population. It also complements the EDSS (Expanded Disability Status Scale) for MS patients, which is known to be little responsive over short periods. We aimed to examine construct and predictive validity, as well as responsiveness of SaGAS 10 in MS patients attending a rehabilitation facility. Method: Sagas is composed of the 25 feet timed walk at fast speed with a flying start (T25FW) and the nine-hole peg test (9-HPT) performed for each hand separately. It was measured at the start and end of a rehabilitation stay using a freely available smartphone app (SaGAS 20/10). Sagas 10 was compared with Rivermead Mobility Index (RMI), the 2-minute timed walking distance at maximum speed (2MWD), and EDSS, measured at the same time points. Construct validity was assessed by Spearman correlation of SaGAS 10 with RMI, 2MWD, and EDSS. A priori coefficients of >0.7, >0.7, and < -0.6 were hypothesized, respectively. Responsiveness of Sagas was assessed by anchoring with a ≥3-point change on the RMI scale and by calculating receiver operator characteristic curves (ROCs). Predictive validity was assessed by correlation of SaGAS scores with an decrease ≥3 in RMI in the following 2 years. Results: 251 patients with MS were included (median EDSS 6, range 2-9; median age 56, median years since diagnosis 17, median stay duration 20 days). Before and after score differences were 1.49 units (95% CI 1.49-1.5) for RMI, 17.5 meters (14.5-20.5) for 2MWD, 0.75 units (0.6-0.9) for SaGAS 10. All measured correlation coefficients for SaGAS 10 exceeded hypothesized values: 0.76 for RMI, 0.84 for 2MWD, and -0.67 for EDSS. Responsiveness was moderate with an AUC of 0.60 (95% CI 0.48-0.72). Also a Spearman correlation of 0.33 was found between SaGAS 10 and the occurrence of an decrease of ≥3 in RMI in the following 2 years. Conclusions: These results indicate that SaGAS 10 is a valid measure for effectiveness of rehabilitation. It is more sensitive to changes over the time span of an intervention than EDSS and easier to administer than MSFC. Being exclusively based on timed performance tests, SaGAS 10 is also less subjective than the EDSS. Its usage can therefore be recommended for routine rehabilitation assessment.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458516663081","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458516663081&atitle=Validity+and+responsiveness+of+SaGAS+10+for+rehabilitation+research+in+multiple+sclerosis+%28MS%29%3A+An+improved+score+for+routine+assessments&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=22&issue=&spage=133&epage=134&aulast=Barin&aufirst=L.&auinit=L.&aufull=Barin+L.&coden=&isbn=&pages=133-134&date=2016&auinit1=L&auinitm=","Embase"

Recent technology facilitates new posturography approaches. Objective: To evaluate construct validity of visual perceptive computing (VPC) for static posturography to study postural control in MS patients. Methods: A total of 90 MS patients and 59 healthy controls (HCs) performed three stance tests: open, closed and tandem stance. Static posturography was performed using a VPC system with Microsoft Kinect. Clinical assessments included Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), Timed-25-Foot-Walk, Short-Maximum-Speed-Walk and 12-item MS Walking Scale (MSWS-12) questionnaire. Reliability was assessed with intra-class correlation coefficients at retest. Results: As a group, MS patients performed worse than HCs in all tests. The closed stance test showed best applicability and reliability. With closed eyes, in 36.7% of patients, the three-dimensional mean angular sway velocity (MSV-3D) was above HCs' 95th percentile. Higher MSV-3D was associated with decreased walking speed (p < 0.001); worse clinical scores, mainly attributable to the cerebellar functional system score (p < 0.001); and reflected in self-reported walking disability (MSWS-12, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Postural control can be reliably assessed by VPC-based static posturography in patients with MS. Abnormal postural control seems to predominantly reflect involvement of cerebellar circuits with impact on gait and walking disability.","Article","10.1177/1352458515625807","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458515625807&atitle=Validity+of+visual+perceptive+computing+for+static+posturography+in+patients+with+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=22&issue=12&spage=1596&epage=1606&aulast=Behrens&aufirst=Janina+R.&auinit=J.R.&aufull=Behrens+J.R.&coden=MUSCF&isbn=&pages=1596-1606&date=2016&auinit1=J&auinitm=R","Embase"

The objective of this study is to evaluate the relationship between brain volumes and TUG performances. Inclusion criteria were a diagnosis of MS and the ability to walk at least 20 m. TUG was performed using a wearable inertial sensor. Times and velocities of TUG sub-phases were calculated by processing trunk acceleration data. Patients underwent to a brain MRI, and volumes of whole brain, white matter (WM), grey matter (GM), and cortical GM (C) were estimated with SIENAX. Sixty patients were enrolled. Mean age was 41.5 ± 11.6 years and mean EDSS 2.3 ± 1.2. Total TUG duration was correlated to lower WM (ρ = 0.358, p = 0.005) and GM (ρ = 0.309, p = 0.017) volumes.

However, assessment of gait speed in coordination with delivery of comprehensive care is usually constrained to clinical environments and is often limited due to mounting demands on the availability of trained clinical staff. These limitations in assessment design could give rise to poor ecological validity and limited ability to tailor interventions to individual patients. Recent advances in wearable sensor technologies have fostered the development of new methods for monitoring parameters that characterize mobility impairment, such as gait speed, outside the clinic, and therefore address many of the limitations associated with clinical assessments. However, these methods are often validated using normal gait patterns; and extending their utility to subjects with gait impairments continues to be a challenge. In this paper, we present a machine learning method for estimating gait speed using a configurable array of skin-mounted, conformal accelerometers. We establish the accuracy of this technique on treadmill walking data from subjects with normal gait patterns and subjects with multiple sclerosis-induced gait impairments. For subjects with normal gait, the best performing model systematically overestimates speed by only 0.01 m/s, detects changes in speed to within less than 1%, and achieves a root-mean-square-error of 0.12 m/s. Extending these models trained on normal gait to subjects with gait impairments yields only minor changes in model performance. For example, for subjects with gait impairments, the best performing model systematically overestimates speed by 0.01 m/s, quantifies changes in speed to within 1%, and achieves a root-mean-square-error of 0.14 m/s. Additional analyses demonstrate that there is no correlation between gait speed estimation error and impairment severity, and that the estimated speeds maintain the clinical significance of ground truth speed in this population. These results support the use of wearable accelerometer arrays for estimating walking speed in normal subjects and their extension to MS patient cohorts with gait impairment.","Article","10.1371/JOURNAL.PONE.0178366","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=19326203&id=doi:10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0178366&atitle=A+machine+learning+approach+for+gait+speed+estimation+using+skin-mounted+wearable+sensors%3A+From+healthy+controls+to+individuals+with+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=PLoS+ONE&title=PLoS+ONE&volume=12&issue=6&spage=&epage=&aulast=McGinnis&aufirst=Ryan+S.&auinit=R.S.&aufull=McGinnis+R.S.&coden=POLNC&isbn=&pages=-&date=2017&auinit1=R&auinitm=S","Embase"

A wearable biosensor not only has the potential to enhance physical exams, but also offers the promise of remote evaluations of the patient either at home or with local non-specialist providers. Areas covered: We performed a structured literature review on the use of wearable biosensors in studies of multiple sclerosis. This included accelerometers, gyroscopes, eye-trackers, grip sensors, and multi-sensors. Expert commentary: Wearable sensors that are sensitive to change in function over time have great potential to serve as outcome metrics in clinical trials. Key features of generalizability are simplicity in the application of the device and delivery of data to the provider. Another important feature to establish is best sampling rate. Having too high of a sampling rate can lead to over-interpretation of noisy data On the other hand, a low sampling rate can result in an insensitive test thus missing subtle changes of clinical interest. Of most importance is to establish metrics derived from wearable devices that provide meaningful data in longitudinal studies.","Review","10.1080/17434440.2017.1388162","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=17452422&id=doi:10.1080%2F17434440.2017.1388162&atitle=Biosensing+in+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Expert+Rev.+Med.+Devices&title=Expert+Review+of+Medical+Devices&volume=14&issue=11&spage=901&epage=912&aulast=Yousef&aufirst=Andrew&auinit=A.&aufull=Yousef+A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=901-912&date=2017&auinit1=A&auinitm=","Embase"

Objective: To investigate the correlation of biosensor metrics with standard clinical measures of MS disease severity in the clinic and free-living environment. Design and methods: Twenty-five MS patients were selected to comprise three severity cohorts based on prior EDSS scores (0 to 2.5, >2.5 to 4.0, and >4.0 to 6.0). The study included three clinic visits during which each subject completed Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), the multiple sclerosis functional composite- 4 (MSFC-4), and other testing while wearing biosensors at 9 body locations. The MSFC testing is composed of the symbol digit modalities test (SDMT), timed 25-foot walk (T25FW), 9-hole peg test (9HPT) and low contrast visual acuity (LCVA). Between the second and third clinic visits, participants wore up to three sensors (on wrist, ankle, and sternum) for eight weeks as they went about their daily lives. Thirty-three biosensor measures collected at clinic visits were compared to in-clinic EDSS and MSFC-4 measures. Spearman correlation of EDSS and MSFC-4 for individual biosensor features were performed. Results: From the in-clinic data, certain biosensor-derived features including gait (stance time, turn angle, mean turn velocity) and balance correlated with EDSS and MSFC-4 scores. Spearman correlation (SC) of turn angle with MSFC-4 z-score was 0.48 (p=0.0293) at visit one and 0.43 (p=0.056) at visit two. Stance time correlation with MSFC-4 z-score was-0.47 (p=0.0431) at visit one and-0.45 (p=0.0492) at visit two. From participants' free-living data, we found several statistically significant correlations of biosensor-derived features with MSFC-4 scores at the nearest clinic visit, including stance time (SC=-0.56; p=0.0055) and turn angle (SC=0.44; p=0.0377). Conclusions: These results demonstrate the correlation of biosensor metrics with in-clinic neurology measures, and the feasibility of applying passive measurement techniques to assess individuals in both clinic and free-living settings.

Whereas the clinical manifestations of AD may be assessed using standard autonomic tests, AD detection at subclinical level is still challenging. Aim: To evaluate basal cardiac autonomic tone and its modulations during sit-to-stand and submaximal exercise in PwMS without clinically overt AD. Methods: 13 PwMS (age: 52.7±7.4 yrs [m±DS]; disease duration: 17.6±12.6 yrs, EDSS: 5.7±1.1) and 10 age-matched controls (HC) (55.6±5.6 yrs) were enrolled. ECG was digitally acquired by a wearable sensor (Faros 180, Finland) while sitting at rest (5 min), standing (2 min) and during a light upper-limb exercise (4 min at 5-10 W). Cardio-vagal (RMSSD [Root Mean Square of Successive Differences]), pnn50 [% of consecutive beats differing>50 ms], HF [High Frequencies: 0.15-0.40 Hz] power) and sympathetic (LF [Low frequencies: 0.04-0.15 Hz] power) parameters of heart rate variability (HRV) were calculated from the edited normal-to-normal beat series. Spearman correlations between RMSSD, disease duration and EDSS were calculated. Results: HR was slightly but non significantly higher in PwMS in all conditions. At baseline, both parasympathetic (pNN50, p=0.03; RMSSD, p=0.09; HF, p=0.01) and sympathetic (LF, p=0.12) indexes were lower in pwMS than in HC. Conversely, during standing and exercise these differences disappeared. No correlations were found between RMSSD, disease duration (r=- 0.31; p=0.31) and EDSS (r=0.34; p=0.24). Conclusions: Although both parasympathetic and sympathetic basal tones appear to be affected by MS, HR modulation during postural challenge and exercise seems to be preserved. HRV analysis may represent a useful, and non-invasive tool to detect subclinical AD and its possible evolution towards an overt dysfunction in PwMS.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458517701017","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458517701017&atitle=Cardiac+autonomic+function+during+postural+changes+and+exercise+in+people+with+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=23&issue=6&spage=902&epage=&aulast=Gervasoni&aufirst=Elisa&auinit=E.&aufull=Gervasoni+E.&coden=&isbn=&pages=902-&date=2017&auinit1=E&auinitm=","Embase"

Behaviour change interventions may assist people with MS to increase physical activity and reduce sedentary behaviour. However, few studies have investigated their effectiveness using objective measures of physical activity, particularly in the long term. Further, interventions that have proven effective in the short term may not be feasible in clinical practice because of the large amount of support provided. The iStep-MS trial aims to determine the safety, feasibility and acceptability of a behaviour change intervention to increase physical activity and reduce sedentary behaviour among people with MS. Methods and analysis Sixty people with MS will be randomised (1:1 ratio) to receive a 12-week intervention or usual care only. The intervention consists of four physical activity consultations with a physiotherapist supported by a handbook and pedometer. Outcomes assessed at baseline, 12 weeks and 9 months are physical activity (ActiGraph wGT3X-BT accelerometer), sedentary behaviour (activPAL3μ), self-reported activity and sitting time, walking capability, fatigue, self-efficacy, participation, quality of life and health service use. The safety of the intervention will be determined by assessing change in pain and fatigue and the incidence of adverse events during the follow-up period. A parallel process evaluation will assess the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention through assessment of fidelity to the programme and semistructured interviews exploring participants' and therapists' experiences of the intervention. The feasibility of conducting an economic evaluation will be determined by collecting data on quality of life and resource use.

In virtue of modern fabrication modes and detection techniques, various immunosensing platforms have been reported on basis of the specific recognition between antigen-antibody pairs. In addition to profit from the development of nanotechnology and molecular biology, diverse fabrication and signal amplification strategies have been designed for detection of protein antigens, which has led to great achievements in fast quantitative and simultaneous testing with extremely high sensitivity and specificity. Besides antigens, determination of antibodies also possesses great significance for clinical laboratory diagnosis. In this review, we will categorize recent immunosensors for proteins by different detection techniques. The basic conception of detection techniques, sensing mechanisms, and the relevant signal amplification strategies are introduced. Since antibodies and antigens have an equal position to each other in immunosensing, all biosensing strategies for antigens can be extended to antibodies under appropriate optimizations. Biosensors for antibodies are summarized, focusing on potential applications in clinical laboratory diagnosis, such as a series of biomarkers for infectious diseases and autoimmune diseases, and an evaluation of vaccine immunity. The excellent performances of these biosensors provide a prospective space for future antibody-detection-based disease serodiagnosis.","Review","10.3390/S17122805","WOS:000423285800105","WoS"

Despite this, POMS patients tend to have characteristically low levels of sustained disability within the first 10 years of disease. As a result, objective measures of physical disability are considered largely unreliable in this population. Continuous accelerometry represents a novel candidate measure for detecting mild physical disability in paediatric MS subjects. Design and Methods: 21 POMS and 50 healthy controls were recruited from the University of Virginia's Paediatric MS Clinic and the local community, respectively. Subjects completed surveys on physical activity (International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and factors affecting activity levels (Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), Beck's Depression Inventory). All subjects completed timed walking tests (2-minute (2MW) and 6-minute (6MW) walks) and 7-day waist-worn continuous accelerometry. Results: Baseline demographics of sex, age, race, and smoking history were not different between groups; however, POMS subjects had higher rates of obesity (p=0.01). POMS subjects had a median Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 1.5 (range: 0-3). Cases and controls reported similar physical activity levels as measured by IPAQ (p=0.61), but POMS subjects reported significantly higher levels of physical fatigue on MFIS (8.0 ± 7.2 vs 4.6 ± 5.3; p=0.03). Of timed walking tests, the 6MW performance best distinguished POMS subjects from controls (p=0.027). There were no significant differences between groups on continuous accelerometry-derived measures, including daily steps, time spent in vigorous or moderate activity, and maximum step rate (MSR). In both groups, obesity negatively impacted subject MSR, but with a more pronounced effect in POMS subjects (r=-0.62; p=0.003). Conclusions: POMS subjects subjectively experience more fatigue but do not report lower levels of physical activity compared to healthy peers. Timed walking tests are potentially useful measures in POMS, but 7-day continuous accelerometry did not distinguish POMS from healthy peers.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458517731404","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458517731404&atitle=Continuous+accelerometry+as+a+measure+of+physical+activity+impairment+in+paediatric-onset+multiple+sclerosis+subjects+versus+healthy+controls&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=23&issue=3&spage=107&epage=108&aulast=Brenton&aufirst=J.N.&auinit=J.N.&aufull=Brenton+J.N.&coden=&isbn=&pages=107-108&date=2017&auinit1=J&auinitm=N","Embase"

The Expanded Disability Status scale (EDSS), the most frequently used disability metric in MS, fails to capture important variability in walking behaviour within categorical ambulatory disability levels that can affect function and influence health. STEPS (average daily step count) measured using remote accelerometry provides granular, continuous information about physical activity in real-world settings. Objective: To measure change in STEPS captured remotely over 1 year in people with MS using a commercially-available wristworn accelerometer (Fitbit Flex). Methods: Adults with MS (relapsing or progressive) able to walk at least 2 minutes were prospectively recruited into the UCSF FITriMS cohort. Physical activity was recorded continuously using a Fitbit Flex over 1 year and data collected using the UCSF Health eHeart research platform. Performance-based measures (e.g. EDSS, Timed-25-foot-walk; T25FW) were evaluated at baseline and 1-year, and patient-reported outcomes (e.g. 12-item MS-walking-scale; MSWS-12) were completed at baseline, 1.5, 3, 6, 9 and 12-months. Univariate and multivariable analyses were performed. Results: Of 100 participants (61 relapsing MS, 39 progressive MS), 69 have completed 1-year follow-up and 11 more are scheduled (anticipated retention 80%); 14 withdrew, and 6 were lost to follow-up. Over 1 year, for the entire cohort, STEPS decreased 10.7% (mean decrease: 1236 steps/day, SD: 3065), and 53.4% decreased STEPS more than 800 steps/day (a threshold that has been proposed as a Minimal Clinically Important Difference for physical activity). Average STEPS in people with progressive MS declined less (0.2% decline from baseline, mean:-903, SD: 2239) than in those with relapsing MS (16.5% decline from baseline, mean:-1413, SD: 3436). There was wide variability in STEPS change over 1 year, including in people whose EDSS remained unchanged (for example, for people who remained EDSS 6.0 change in STEPS ranged from +814 to-3718). Discussion: Longitudinal measurement of STEPS using a commercially- available activity monitor is feasible with high retention and reveals changes in daily function not otherwise captured by more traditional disability metrics.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458517731404","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458517731404&atitle=Continuous+wrist-worn+accelerometry+captures+change+in+average+daily+step+count+in+people+with+multiple+sclerosis+over+one+year&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=23&issue=3&spage=145&epage=146&aulast=Block&aufirst=V.&auinit=V.&aufull=Block+V.&coden=&isbn=&pages=145-146&date=2017&auinit1=V&auinitm=","Embase"

Walking and balance are of particular interest, due to their being frequently impaired in MS. We have previously developed a walking speed assessment module incorporated into an iPadR-based neurological performance test [MSPT]. In addition to the traditional outcome measure of walking time, data from the accelerometer and gyroscope within the iPadR can be collected, yet the validity of these measurements is not established. Goals: To determine the convergent validity of parameters derived from the accelerometer and gyroscope in the iPadR to characterize gait and postural instability in MS patients, compared to walking speed and posturometry. Methods: MS patients with gait disturbance performed walks under various conditions (Timed 25 Foot Walk [T25FW], comfortable pace walk on the GAITRiteR gait analysis system, and treadmill walking in the Computer Assisted Rehabilitation ENvironment [CAREN] system) while wearing the iPadR on the back at the sacral level. Standing balance (eyes opened and eyes closed) was also assessed using a TetraxR balance analysis platform while wearing the iPadR. Associations between acceleration- based iPadR parameters, instrumented measures of walking speed and balance, and self-report measures of walking and balance confidence, were assessed. Results: Data from 49 participants were analyzed (age 55.5 ± 7.5 years, 57% women, 61% progressive disease course, 55% using a cane or walker). Significant correlations were observed between walking speed (under all 3 conditions) and many iPadR acceleration- derived parameters (Spearman r > 0.5), with stronger correlations in participants walking without an assistive device (some with r > 0.7). Significant correlations were also observed between the Stability score from the TetraxR system (eyes closed condition) and most acceleration-derived parameters (Spearman r > 0.5), with stronger correlations among participants who used a cane or a walker (some with r > 0.7). Moderate associations between iPadR parameters and patient-reported walking and balance status were detected (r > 0.3). Conclusions: Our results suggest satisfactory convergent validity between acceleration-based parameters derived from the iPadR and instrumented measures of walking speed and postural stability, although performance varies depending on the level of walking impairment.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458517731404","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458517731404&atitle=Convergent+validity+of+acceleration-derived+parameters+from+iPadR-based+walking+and+balance+testing&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=23&issue=3&spage=146&epage=&aulast=Bethoux&aufirst=F.&auinit=F.&aufull=Bethoux+F.&coden=&isbn=&pages=146-&date=2017&auinit1=F&auinitm=","Embase"

Recent quantitative reviews suggest web-based interventions are effective at increasing physical activity. Capturing the user experience is important to optimise the development of these interventions and understand factors impacting on their use. Thus, a review of both qualitative and quantitative studies is indicated. Aims: To investigate the use of web-based interventions in increasing physical activity in adults with MS, and to explore user experiences. The review also sought to establish whether levels of physical activity achieved are in line with MS-specific guidance. Methods: Using the Joanna Briggs methodology for comprehensive systematic reviews, 12 databases were searched (dates: 2000- 2016). Inclusion criteria were studies published in English investigating the use of web-based interventions to increase physical activity in adults with MS. Interventions were exercise or lifestyle activity based, with/without an active comparator, usual care or wait-list control and reported measures of physical activity (e.g. accelerometers or physical activity questionnaires). Qualitative studies exploring users' experiences of these interventions in any context were included. Studies describing use of the internet to deliver virtual assessments or gaming interventions (e.g. Wii/Xbox) were excluded. Results: 881 records were identified through database and hand searching; after removal of duplicates 618 titles and abstracts were screened of which 549 were excluded. 69 full text papers were screened for eligibility with 60 excluded (n=5 not web based, n=13 no physical activity measure, n=15 review papers, n=10 duplicates, n=15 no full text, n=2 other).

A growing body of research demonstrates how these technological tools can be leveraged for use by people with wide-ranging disabling conditions. Whereas computers of all types have proven their usefulness at home, school, and in the workplace, they are also helpful for people with disability and can be life-changing. Technology offers access to the world at large and in many cases substituting for human supports by affording increased mobility, safety, and functional independence. Therefore, addressing issues of digital inequality is essential to maximize activity and participation in persons with multiple sclerosis (MS). The aims of the present study is to highlight the role of everyday technology and participation in individuals with MS. First, we will identify and describe the barriers in use of everyday technology among persons with MS. Additionally, we will examine opportunities to integrate everyday technology into assessment and treatment of patients with MS. Methods: A between-subjects design was utilized to compare 35 individuals with MS and 16 healthy controls (HC) on their computer technology skills (i.e. internet use, email, health literacy). Participants were administered a battery of neuropsychological tests and questionnaires to assess cognitive skills, functional status, and affect symptomatology. Results: Participants with MS reported significantly more difficulties than HC participants in computer skills, internet use, and email use, in part due to cognitive impairment. In addition, selfreports of quality of life and everyday functional abilities were correlated with computer technology use. Conclusion: In order to assure the potential of computer technologies for persons with MS, the primary challenge will be ensuring that persons with MS receive adequate assistance in learning to use their smartphone, as well as increase their awareness of a wider range of potentially helpful apps and functions.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458517731406","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458517731406&atitle=Everyday+technology+use+in+MS%3A+Limitations+and+opportunities+in+using+everyday+technology+in+persons+with+MS&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=23&issue=3&spage=675&epage=&aulast=Goverover&aufirst=Y.&auinit=Y.&aufull=Goverover+Y.&coden=&isbn=&pages=675-&date=2017&auinit1=Y&auinitm=","Embase"

Peroxynitrite is a short-lived oxidant species that is a potent inducer of cell death. Uric acid (UA) can scavenge the peroxynitrite to avoid the formation of nitrotyrosine, which is formed from the reaction between peroxynitrite and tyrosine (Try). Scavenging the peroxynitrite avoids the inactivation of cellular enzymes and modification of the cytoskeleton. Reduced level of UA decreases the ability of the body from preventing the peroxynitrite toxicity. On the other hand, the abnormal level of UA leads to gout and hyperuricemia. Allopurinol (AP) is administered in UA lowering therapy. Thus, the simultaneous determination of UA, Try and AP using N-CDs modified glassy carbon (GC) electrode was demonstrated for the first time. Initially, N-CDs were prepared from L-asparagine by pyrolysis and characterized by different spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. The HR-TEM image shows that the average size of the prepared N-CDs was 1.8 +/- 0.03 nm. Further, the N-CDs were directly attached on GC electrode by simple immersion, follows Micheal's nucleophilic addition. XPS of N-CDs shows a peak at 285.3 eV corresponds to the formation of C-N bond. The GC/N-CDs electrode shows higher electrocatalytic activity towards UA, Tyr and AP by not only shifting their oxidation potentials toward less positive potential but also enhanced their oxidation currents in contrast to bare GC electrode. The GC/N-CDs electrode shows the limit of detection of 13x10(-10) M (S/N=3) and the sensitivity of 924 A mM(-1) cm(-2) towards the determination of UA. Finally, the N-CDs modified electrode was utilized for the determination of UA, Tyr and AP in human blood serum and urine samples.","Article","10.1016/J.BIOS.2017.02.034","WOS:000401201300005","WoS"

Objective: This pilot study aimed to investigate user confidence and satisfaction in using smart technology for self-management of symptoms associated with multiple sclerosis. Specifically, to determine if demographic and disease variables were predictive of baseline confidence and satisfaction in smart technology use and the effects of time and training. Design Methods: This 2x2 mixed between-within subjects study involved 8 community-dwelling adults with multiple sclerosis. The treatment group received smartwatch training and used the device for a 4-week period with ongoing support from an occupational therapist. All participants completed a newly-developed questionnaire, the Smart Technology Satisfaction and Confidence Scale at baseline and post intervention to examine perceptions of satisfaction and confidence in using smart technology. Results: Findings suggest that age, marital status, living situation, education, work status and disease severity were significantly related to baseline confidence and satisfaction ratings. There was a significant within-subjects effect of time on confidence scores but this was not affected by treatment condition. There was also a significant change in satisfaction of usability scores from baseline to post intervention, which was significantly associated with receiving training. Conclusions: Smartwatches present a novel platform for assisting with self-management of symptoms. Exposure to the latest smart technology may improve user confidence.

Therefore, alternative sensitive outcomes are needed. Using machine learning, clinician-acquired disability scales can be combined with timed measures of neurological functions such as walking speed (e.g. 25-foot walk; 25FW) or fine finger movements (e.g. 9-hole peg test; 9HPT) into sensitive composite clinical scales, such as the recently developed combinatorial, weight-adjusted disability scale (CombiWISE). Ideally, these complementary simplified measurements of certain neurological functions could be performed regularly at patients’ homes using smartphones. Objectives: We asked whether tests amenable to adaptation to smartphone technology, such as finger and foot tapping have comparable sensitivity and specificity to current non-clinician-acquired disability measures. Results: We observed that finger and foot tapping can differentiate RRMS and progressive MS in a cross-sectional study and can also measure yearly and two-year disease progression in the latter, with better power (based on z-scores) in comparison to currently utilized 9HPT and 25FW. Conclusions: Replacing the 9HPT and 25FW with simplified tests broadly adaptable to smartphone technology may enhance the power of composite scales for progressive MS.","Article","10.1177/2055217316688930","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=20552173&id=doi:10.1177%2F2055217316688930&atitle=Finger+and+foot+tapping+as+alternative+outcomes+of+upper+and+lower+extremity+function+in+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.+Exp.+Transl.+Clin.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal+-+Experimental%2C+Translational+and+Clinical&volume=3&issue=1&spage=&epage=&aulast=Tanigawa&aufirst=Makoto&auinit=M.&aufull=Tanigawa+M.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2017&auinit1=M&auinitm=","Embase"

The KosMuS-project will explore correlations between nutrition and disease activity by gathering big data and applying data mining methods. Participants with MS will use a smartphone application to register daily nutrition intake, changes in perceived disease activity as well as factors such as stress levels, physical activity, and sleep. The combination of digital self-monitoring and big data analysis provides new opportunities for identifying patterns between nutrition and disease activity. However, this method requires that participants are continuously involved and consistent in their self-monitoring to ensure a sufficient dataset with regards to size and quality. Consequently, first phase of KosMuS aims to investigate motivational factors for patients with MS to engage in technology-based research on nutrition and disease activity. Methods: In July-August 2016, 15 interviews were conducted with people with MS. The interview guide included a combination of questions related to nutrition, eHealth literacy and empowerment. The transcribed interviews were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: We identified four themes necessary for understanding the motivational factors among participants: technology and data collection, nutrition, lifestyle, and life with MS. Participants experience a number of triggers and symptoms related to nutrition and lifestyle. Technology and data collection should be kept simple and provide an easy overview of the participant's own data. Participants have different strategies and tools for handling MS in everyday life. Conclusion: To be able to motivate participants to register daily nutrition intake and changes in disease activity, the project must address the following four themes: technology and data collection, nutrition, lifestyle, and life with MS. This must be done both in app development and communication to participants.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458517701017","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458517701017&atitle=Four+themes+to+address+when+designing+eHealth+solutions+for+people+with+MS&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=23&issue=6&spage=911&epage=&aulast=Karnoe&aufirst=A.&auinit=A.&aufull=Karnoe+A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=911-&date=2017&auinit1=A&auinitm=","Embase"

This study aims at assessing the feasibility of constraining the gaze on a target while walking to limit gait disorders for patients with MS. Methods: Ten patients with progressive MS participated in the study. Seven needed an occasional walking aid (A-MS) (EDSS (Expanded Disability Status Scale de Kurtzke) score > 6) and 3 did not [EDSS score ≤ 6 (NA-MS)]. Six out of 10 MS had consistent cognitive disorders (CSCT score-Computerized Speed Cognitive Test < - 1.5 SD) (CD-MS) and 4 did not (NCD-MS). Oculomotricity signals were registered during 10 m way and return walk with constrained (CG) and unconstrained (UG) gaze (target fixation on the back wall). Results: All patients increased their fixation rate on the back wall between UG and CG (31.4% vs 71.2%; P<0.01), regardless of their EDSS score. Best fixers tend to be NCD-MS (tendency: Pearson coefficient R = 0.56; P=0.08). Discussion: Even patients with severe gait disorders can perform the walk-target fixation double task, so that giving a fixation instruction could help patients looking less the ground, and therefore, decreasing the risk to lean forward and fall out. No matter how severe their gait disorders are, patients with few cognitive disorders would probably be more able to look in front of them when walking in daily life with free gaze, if they are advised to do so as part of a rehabilitation program.","Conference Abstract","10.1016/J.NEUCLI.2017.10.046","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=17697131&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.neucli.2017.10.046&atitle=Gaze+constraint+while+walking+in+progressive+multiple+sclerosis%3A+Afeasibility+study&stitle=Neurophysiol.+Clin.&title=Neurophysiologie+Clinique&volume=47&issue=&spage=354&epage=&aulast=Vienne&aufirst=A.&auinit=A.&aufull=Vienne+A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=354-&date=2017&auinit1=A&auinitm=","Embase"

The oral delayed-release dimethyl fumarate (DMF; also known as gastro- resistant DMF) reduces inflammation and oxidative stress, peginterferon beta-1a (PEG) optimizes interferon-related signaling by reduced injection interval and daclizumab beta (DAC BETA) modulates interleukin-2 signaling by blocking CD25. In addition to MS related adherence barriers, each therapy is accompanied by different challenges based on application route and side effects. Patient support programs (PSPs) optimized for each therapy were thus developed. The objective of this retrospective cohort study is to evaluate the real-life situation for MS patients. Furthermore, the potential benefit of individual patient coaching is analysed. Methods: From February 2014, September 2014 and August 2016 patients were recruited for DMF, PEG and DAC BETA, respectively. All patients signed a written consent form and were provided with a smartphone application with reminder function. Contents and coaching frequency were adapted according to challenges and patient needs. Results: As of April 2017, 16480 patients were recruited. Data for 9561 and 4619 MS patients including 1472 and 1142 dropouts could be analyzed for DMF and PEG, respectively. Overall, gastrointestinal issues (GI) (24.6%) for DMF and flu-like symptoms (FLS) (36.6%) for PEG were reported as the most frequent dropout reason of the discontinuers. While GI was most frequent in the first three therapy months, FLS were consistently the main reason for PEG therapy discontinuation. Time to therapy discontinuation was differentiated for more intensively and less intensively coached patients. 5.9%, 10.4% and 18.0% of more intensively coached DMF patients stopped therapy after 3, 6, and 12 months compared to 10.4%, 15.9% and 25.3%, respectively. PEG therapy discontinuation after 6 months was reduced for more intensively coached patients by 4.1% (p=0.0003) compared to the less intensively coached group. The preliminary result for DAC BETA therapy discontinuation after 6 months is 4.3% (n=139, 6 dropouts). Conclusion: Side effects reported in the phase III studies are the main reasons for discontinuing MS therapy. Patient coaching provides an essential contribution effectively address preventable or manageable side effects and promotes regular treatment monitoring, leading to supervised therapy continuation and treatment satisfaction.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458517731285","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458517731285&atitle=Hands+on+experience+in+therapy+management+and+challenges+addressed+in+an+individualized+patient+support+program+of+three+different+therapeutic+disease-modifying+approaches+to+treat+multiple+sclerosis+in+Germany&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=23&issue=3&spage=890&epage=891&aulast=Begus-Nahrmann&aufirst=Y.&auinit=Y.&aufull=Begus-Nahrmann+Y.&coden=&isbn=&pages=890-891&date=2017&auinit1=Y&auinitm=","Embase"

Although diffusion weighted imaging is useful in broadly assessing white matter structure, it has limited utility in identifying specific underlying neurobiological components, such as myelin. The purpose of the present study was to explore relationships between myelination and impairment, function and activity in individuals with chronic stroke. Assessments of paretic upper-extremity impairment and function were administered, and 72-hour accelerometer based activity monitoring was conducted on 19 individuals with chronic stroke. Participants completed a magnetic resonance imaging protocol that included a high resolution T-1 anatomical scan and a multi-component T-2 relaxation imaging scan to quantify myelin water fraction (MWF). MWF was automatically parcellated from pre- and post-central subcortical regions of interest and quantified as an asymmetry ratio (contralesional/ipsilesional). Cluster analysis was used to group more and less impaired individuals based on Fugl-Meyer upper extremity scores. A significantly higher precentral MWF asymmetry ratio was found in the more impaired group compared to the less impaired group (p < 0.001). There were no relationships between MWF asymmetry ratio and upper-limb use. Stepwise multiple linear regression identified precentral MWF asymmetry as the only variable to significantly predict impairment and motor function in the upper extremity (UE). These results suggest that asymmetric myelination in a motor specific brain area is a significant predictor of upper-extremity impairment and function in individuals with chronic stroke. As such, myelination may be utilized as a more specific marker of the neurobiological changes that predict long term impairment and recovery from stroke. (C) 2017 The Authors.

This represents a serious issue as Physical activity (PA) is useful in improving most motor impairments due to MS and is often suggested as a supplement to the pharmacologic treatments. Aims: This study aims to quantitatively assess the hourly trends of PA in pwMS through objective measurements performed using wearable accelerometers previously validated for MS. Methods: Thirty-four pwMS (age 46.8±11.2) with EDSS score in the range 1-7.5 participated on a voluntary basis together with an equal number of healthy subjects age and sex matched. All participants wore a tri-axial accelerometer for 7 days; pwMS were also administered MSWS-12, MFIS and EQ-5D-3L questionnaires. Vector Magnitude Counts (VMC, the square root of the sum of the squared accelerations along the 3 axes) and Steps Counts (SC) were calculated on hourly basis from 6AM to 11PM. MANOVA was used to assess differences in PA parameters introduced by the pathology and Pearson's coefficient to verify the correlation between PA levels and MSWS-12, MFIS and EQ-5D-3L. Results: MANOVA revealed that pwMS exhibit reduced SC within 7 PM and 9 PM (p<0.025), but not in all other slot times. PwMS also perform fewer daily steps than HC (12000 vs. 10750), and reduced VMC, although not significant. Weak to moderate correlations were found between VMC, SC and scores of EQ- 5D-3L, (r=0.28 (not significant) and 0.345) and MSWS-12 (r=- 0.44 and -0.53). Conclusion: The obtained results confirm that pwMS perform a reduced amount of PA when compared with healthy individuals, particularly in after-work time which are usually devoted to PA or leisure. This may indicate that fatigue tends to cumulate during the first part of the day and prevents pwMS to carry out sufficient PA afterwards.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458517701017","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458517701017&atitle=Hourly+trends+of+physical+activity+in+people+with+multiple+sclerosis+short+title%3A+Physical+activity+in+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=23&issue=6&spage=900&epage=901&aulast=Porta&aufirst=Micaela&auinit=M.&aufull=Porta+M.&coden=&isbn=&pages=900-901&date=2017&auinit1=M&auinitm=","Embase"

The triggers of the BBB breakdown are not fully understood, but studies have suggested the involvement of cytokines and chemokines on endothelial regulation. Objective: Assessment of MS serum for BBB disrupting activity using real-time biosensor technology. Design Methods: 30 serum samples from relapsing-remitting MS patients with active lesions were acquired from the Brain and Spinal Fluids Bank in the USA. The effect of serum on the integrity of an in vitro brain microvascular endothelium BBB model was measured using Electric Cell-substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS) biosensor. Results: 3 of the 30 MS serum samples majorly disrupted the integrity of brain microvascular endothelium. All samples were obtained from relapsing MS patients. We hypothesized that BBB breakdown is caused by non-cellular soluble factors (e.g. inflammatory cytokines, antibodies, lipids or enzymes) in the serum of some patients with relapsing remitting MS. The mechanism of the serum-mediated barrier disruption is still unknown, and identity of the soluble factors is being investigated. Conclusions: We propose that the BBB compromise caused by these soluble factors could potentially contribute to relapses. Ongoing study aims to extend these findings in larger cohort to discover the molecular identity of these BBB disrupting non-cellular factors.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458517734699","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458517734699&atitle=Identification+of+blood-brain+barrier+disrupting+factors+in+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=23&issue=13&spage=NP6&epage=&aulast=Kho&aufirst=Dan&auinit=D.&aufull=Kho+D.&coden=&isbn=&pages=NP6-&date=2017&auinit1=D&auinitm=","Embase"

Traditional diagnosis of autoimmune disease is primarily based on physician assessment combined with core laboratory tests. However, these tests are not sensitive enough to detect early molecular events, and quite often, it is too late to control these autoimmune diseases and reverse tissue damage when conventional tests show positivity for disease. It is fortunate that during the past decade, research in nanotechnology has provided enormous opportunities for the development of ultrasensitive biosensors in detecting early biomarkers with high sensitivity. Biosensors consist of a biorecognition element and a transducer which are able to facilitate an accurate detection of proinflammatory molecules, autoantibodies and other disease-causing molecules. Apparently, novel biosensors could be superior to traditional metrics in assessing the drug efficacy in clinical trials, especially when specific biomarkers are indicative of the pathogenesis of disease. Furthermore, the portability of a biosensor enables the development of pointof- care devices.

All participants underwent a SC MRI with 3D-MPRAGE and we measured the upper cervical cross-sectional area (UCCA, at C2-C3 level in mm2) and volume (C1 to C3 in mm3). 41 patients underwent a PSIR sequence to measure the upper cord grey matter area (UCGA, at C2-C3 level in mm2) but 3 were excluded due to lowquality scans and 11 due to grey matter lesions. Patients were evaluated with the expanded disability status scale (EDSS) and classified based on their walking ability: EDSS < 4.0 (N=67) and >4.0 (N=13). Results. Patients had less DA compared to HV (mean [standard deviation] = 500165.9 [194503.3] vs 610694.6 [203748.1]; p=0.02); lower MVPA (mean [SD]= 36.5 [27.8] vs 66.1 [33.3]; p< 0.001), lower UCCA (mean [SD]=48.4 [7] vs 51.9 [5.1]; p=0.02) and SC volume (mean [SD]=941 [216.9] vs 1030.1 [162.9]; p=0.04). Patients with >4.0 showed less DA compared to patients with EDSS < 4.0 (mean [SD]= 323136.2 [134070.4] vs 534515 [186130]; p< 0.001), less MVPA (mean [SD]= 12.8 [18.3] vs 41.1 [27.1]; p< 0.001), higher sedentary activity (mean [SD]= 1227.4 [73.2] vs 1135.3 [119.9]; p=0.001), lower UCCA (mean [SD]= 43.7 [5.5] vs 49.3 [6.9]; p=0.006) and lower SC volume (mean [SD]= 796.1 [158.2] vs 969 [216.5]; p=0.004). No differences were observed in UCGA between EDSS subgroups. UCCA and SC volume correlated with DA (r=0.3, p=0.03), and UCGA with DA (r=0.5, p=0.009) and MVPA (r=0.4, p=0.03). Only UCGA showed a moderate association with average DA (r=0.6, p=0.005), light activity (r=0.4, p=0.048) and MVPA (r=0.5, p=0.02) when controlling for age and sex. Conclusion. As walking disability progresses in MS, patients become more sedentary and carry out less vigorous activities. Our study provides further evidence that SC atrophy in MS, and especially grey matter impacts negatively in daily activity, and mainly in highly demanding activities.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458517731406","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458517731406&atitle=Impact+of+spinal+cord+atrophy+on+daily+activity+in+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=23&issue=3&spage=532&epage=533&aulast=Sola-Valls&aufirst=N.&auinit=N.&aufull=Sola-Valls+N.&coden=&isbn=&pages=532-533&date=2017&auinit1=N&auinitm=","Embase"

Wireless inertial sensors can accurately measure numerous walking and balance parameters but these measures require evaluation of reliability in PwMS. The current study determined the test-retest reliability of wireless inertial sensor measures obtained during an instrumented standing balance test and an instrumented Timed Up and Go test in PwMS. Methods: Fifteen PwMS and 15 healthy control subjects (HC) performed an instrumented standing balance and instrumented Timed Up and Go (TUG) test on two separate days. Ten instrumented standing balance measures and 18 instrumented TUG measures were computed from the wireless sensor data. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated to determine test-retest reliability of all instrumented standing balance and instrumented TUG measures. Correlations were evaluated between the instrumented standing balance and instrumented TUG measures and self-reported walking and balance performance, fall history, and clinical disability. Results: For both groups, ICCs for instrumented standing balance measures were best for spatio-temporal measures, while frequency measures were less reliable. All instrumented TUG measures exhibited good to excellent (ICCs > 0.60) test-retest reliability in PwMS and in HC. There were no correlations between self-report walking and balance scores and instrumented TUG or instrumented standing balance metrics, but there were correlations between instrumented TUG and instrumented standing balance metrics and fall history and clinical disability status. Conclusions: Measures from the instrumented standing balance and instrumented TUG tests exhibit good to excellent reliability, demonstrating their potential as objective assessments for clinical trials. A subset of the most reliable measures is recommended for measuring walking and balance in clinical settings.","Article","10.1186/S12984-017-0251-0","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=17430003&id=doi:10.1186%2Fs12984-017-0251-0&atitle=Instrumented+balance+and+walking+assessments+in+persons+with+multiple+sclerosis+show+strong+test-retest+reliability&stitle=J.+NeuroEng.+Rehabil.&title=Journal+of+NeuroEngineering+and+Rehabilitation&volume=14&issue=1&spage=&epage=&aulast=Craig&aufirst=Jordan+J.&auinit=J.J.&aufull=Craig+J.J.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2017&auinit1=J&auinitm=J","Embase"

In addition to validated clinical tests, kinematic measures of gait may provide useful information for the customization of rehabilitative intervention. We explored their usefulness in evaluating clinical improvement after intensive neurorehabilitation in progressive MS. Methods: Seventeen subjects with progressive MS, (7 females), median age 49.7 (37-68), median expanded disability status scale-EDSS 5.9 (3.5-6.5), underwent testing of functional independence measure-FIM, walking speed with the 10-meter walk test-10MWT, walk endurance with the 6 minute walk test- 6MWT, Berg balance scale-BBS at hospitalization (T0) and after a 4-week intensive neurorehabilitative program (T1). Clinical measures were correlated with gait parameters (step frequency-cadence, velocity, cycle length, cycle acceleration, symmetry index of postero-anterior acceleration) collected during the 10MWT using a pocket-sized device combining accelerometers and a magnetometer, placed over the L5 vertebra with an elastic belt. Results: At both time points, cadence correlated with FIM (T0: Pearson's r 0.546, p=0.023; T1: r 0.638, p=0.006), 6MWT (T0: r 0.803, p=0.001; T1: r 0.563, p=0.036), BBS (T0: r 0.675, p=0.003; T1: r 0.518, p=0.033). Velocity correlated with FIM (T0: r 0.590, p=0.013; T1 r 0.673, p=0.003), 6MWT (T0: r 0.773, p=0.002; T1: r 0.641, p=0.014), BBS (T0: r 0.596, p=0.011; T1: r 0.577, p=0.015). Cadence and velocity increase correlated with FIM improvement (r +0.501, p=0,040 and r +0.488, p=0.047, respectively), while 10MWT was significantly correlated with 6MWT at T0 (r-0.728 e p 0.007) and T1 (r-0.766 e p 0.001) and BBS at T0 (r-0.593 e p 0.015). Conclusion: Cadence and velocity correlated with all clinical measures whereas 10MWT showed correlation only with 6MWT and BBS, suggesting that quantitative gait kinematics correlate with clinical measures better than 10MWT. Cadence and velocity improvement seems to reflect the increase in functional independence in daily activities rather than in walk endurance. These data suggest the feasibility and usefulness of gait testing with a wearable device in the clinical setting and prompt larger validation studies.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458517731404","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458517731404&atitle=Intensive+neurorehabilitation+is+associated+with+improved+gait+kinematic+analysis+in+progressive+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=23&issue=3&spage=144&epage=&aulast=Zanetta&aufirst=C.&auinit=C.&aufull=Zanetta+C.&coden=&isbn=&pages=144-&date=2017&auinit1=C&auinitm=","Embase"

We present correlations between smartphone-based and in-clinic assessments of cognitive and physical measures in patients with MS. Objective: To report interim analysis of correlations between smartphone-based and in-clinic tests from the FLOODLIGHT (NCT02952911) study. Methods: Patients with MS (McDonald 2010 criteria; 18-55 years; Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS]=0-5.5; n=80) and healthy controls (n=40) received a preconfigured smartphone and smartwatch that prompt the user to perform the FLOODLIGHT test battery, comprising 'active tests' (daily hand motor function, gait and static balance tests; weekly cognitive tests; and patient-reported outcomes) and 'passive monitoring' (ongoing collection of metrics on gait and mobility), for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint assessed participants' adherence. In-clinic tests (e.g. EDSS, 9-hole peg test, Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW), Berg balance scale) and brain MRI assessments were performed. The secondary endpoint explored whether data collected using the smartphone-and smartwatch-based remote monitoring are significantly different between MS and healthy controls and correlate with in-clinic visit clinical outcomes. The correlation between smartphone-based and in-clinic tests was reported using Spearman's correlation coefficient (SCC). Results: As of 27 March 2017, the first baseline cross-sectional interim analysis of 30 patients showed correlation between the number of correct responses in the smartphone-based SDMT vs the oral SDMT (SCC=0.73, p< 0.001) and MS Impact Scale (MSIS)-29 total score (SCC=-0.52, p=0.003). Turning speed measured with the smartphone-based Five U-Turn Test correlated with the T25FW (n=28, SCC=-0.62, p< 0.001) as well as the ambulation items of the MSIS-29 (n=29, SCC=-0.64, p< 0.001). A longitudinal interim analysis of adherence and further correlations between baseline FLOODLIGHT sensor-based and in-clinic testing data will be presented. Conclusions: Initial analysis of data from FLOODLIGHT indicates smartphone-based assessments are consistently correlated with in-clinic tests.

This study assesses feasibility of use of 'MoveIt' for student physiotherapists (MoveIt: An android Smart Phone application with a standardised procedure to measure stance stability). Methods: Twelve final year student physiotherapists tested participants with 'MoveIt' alongside secondary measures of balance; namely the PPA and the Activities of Balance Confidence questionnaire. Participants were recruited via the Plymouth branch of the MS Society and the University of the 3rd Age. Six people with balance impair-ment and ataxia signs (progressive multiple sclerosis) and 22 older aged adults met study inclusion criteria. PPA scores and MoveIt measures of postural sway were collected simul-taneously across three thirty second collections. Brief exit interviews with each student physiotherapist was undertaken to assess feasibility of use. Results: Participants described MoveIt App and accompanying standardised clinical procedure feasible in terms of ease of use, environmental adaptability and application/use of the equipment with individuals with balance impairment and ataxia signs. Students considered use of MoveIt in practice currently limited by (i) Poor immediate visibility of outcome (requiring offline analysis). (ii) Inability of patients to self-don/doff the Smart Phone within current design. PPA and MoveIt sway correlated with large-effect across all stance conditions. Conclusion(s): MoveIt is valid, easy to use, portable and potentially less susceptible to operator error than PPA Methods, thus may be a more appropriate clinical choice. Further development of the App is now needed to: (1) Provide fast and reliable visualisation of outcome measures and (2) Adapt Methods to enable patients to independently use the App for self-monitoring of balance. Implications: MoveIt could provide clinicians with a valid, easy to use, portable Method of measuring balance if further developed to ensure ease of analysis and interpretation of data. Use of a standardised Method in conjunction with the App is essential if the tool is to be used as a reliable Method of obtaining measures of balance either (i) pre and post intervention or (ii) longitudinally as a record of disease progression in those with long term degenerative conditions.","Conference Abstract","10.1016/J.PHYSIO.2017.11.136","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=18731465&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.physio.2017.11.136&atitle=Investigating+feasibility+of+use+of+an+Android+Smart+Phone+Application+%28MoveIt%29+as+a+clinical+outcome+measure&stitle=Physiotherapy&title=Physiotherapy+%28United+Kingdom%29&volume=103&issue=&spage=e97&epage=&aulast=Bunn&aufirst=L.&auinit=L.&aufull=Bunn+L.&coden=&isbn=&pages=e97-&date=2017&auinit1=L&auinitm=","Embase"

This study investigated PA levels in persons with MS as a function of fall risk categories. Forty-seven persons with MS participated in the study and were categorized into either increased fall risk (IFR; n = 21; 55.5 ± 9.0 years) or normal fall risk (NFR; n = 26; 51.2 ± 12.9 years) groups based on scores from the Activities-Balance Confidence scale.

Univariate and covariate analyses were used to compare the differences in PA between fall risk groups. The average steps per day of the NFR group was significant higher compared with the IFR group (6024 ± 2533.1 vs. 2599 ± 1622.7 steps; P < 0.001), and the difference remained after controlling for disability level (5351 ± 2298.6 vs. 3432 ± 2363.6 steps; P = 0.016).

The middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP) represents a key connection in this network as it conveys afferent fibers from the cerebral cortex to the cerebellum. We report a case series of patients with lesions of the middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP) having different tremor characteristics. Methods: We analyzed quantitatively the tremor of 116 patients with brainstem and/or cerebellar lesions and here we report the results of 5 patients with MCP lesion of different causes (1 patients with acute stroke, 1 with subacute stroke, 1 with multiple sclerosis, 1 with postinfectious ADEM, and 1 patient with fragileX tremorataxia syndrome (FXTAS). Tremor was measured by biaxial accelerometry. Center frequency, frequency dispersion and tremor intensity were calculated. In 4 patients, control measurements were performed to assess the evolution of tremor. Detailed analysis of the MRI-data were performed by a neuroradiologist. Results: Pathologic tremor was detected in 3/5 patients (60%). Tremulous patients had acute stroke/MS-shub or FXTAS. Their tremor had low intensity, low centerfrequency (2 Hz), whereas tremor of FXTAS-patient had higher intensity and a center-frequency of 5 Hz. Frequency dispersion was low in both categories. Acute patients presented a complete tremor recovery in cca. 4 weeks, whereas the FXTAS patient's tremor worsened. Conclusion: Our results show that the location of the lesion does not explain the mechanism of tremorogenesis and tremor characteristics. The pathomechanism of the lesion might influence tremor frequency and evolution.

Methods Seven days of activity monitor data were collected for 26 participants with MS (age = 44.5 ± 11.9 years; time since diagnosis = 6.5 ± 6.2 years; Patient Determined Disease Steps = ≤3). Mean daily step count and mean daily EE (kcal) were calculated for all combinations of days (127 combinations), and compared to the respective 7-day mean daily step count or mean daily EE using intra-class correlations (ICC), the Generalizability Theory and Bland-Altman. Results For step count, ICC values of 0.94–0.98 and a G-coefficient of 0.81 indicate a minimum of any random 2-day combination is required to reliably calculate mean daily step count. For EE, ICC values of 0.96–0.99 and a G-coefficient of 0.83 indicate a minimum of any random 4-day combination is required to reliably calculate mean daily EE.

OBJECTIVE: To examine differences in metrics of mobility, postural control, and cognition in persons with MS with distinct fall risk status; and to investigate predictors of fall risk group membership using discriminant analysis. METHODS: Forty-seven persons with MS completed the Activities-Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale and underwent a battery of assessments of mobility, balance, and cognition. Participants further wore an accelerometer for 7 days as an assessment of steps/day. Participants were allocated into fall risk groups based on ABC scale scores (increased fall risk (IFR); and normal fall risk (NFR)). We examined univariate differences between groups using ANOVA, and discriminant function analysis (DFA) identified the significant multivariate predictors of FR status. RESULTS: After controlling for disability level, the IFR group had significantly (p<0.05) worse scores on measures of mobility (i.e., MSWS-12, 6MW, and steps/day) compared to the NFR group.

Here, we apply a novel wireless, skin-mounted, and conformal inertial sensor (BioStampRC, MC10 Inc.) to examine gait characteristics of PwMS under controlled conditions. We determine the accuracy and precision of BioStampRC in measuring gait kinematics by comparing to contemporary research-grade measurement devices. Methods A total of 45 PwMS, who presented with diverse walking impairment (Mild MS = 15, Moderate MS = 15, Severe MS = 15), and 15 healthy control subjects participated in the study. Participants completed a series of clinical walking tests. During the tests participants were instrumented with BioStampRC and MTx (Xsens, Inc.) sensors on their shanks, as well as an activity monitor GT3X (Actigraph, Inc.) on their non-dominant hip. Shank angular velocity was simultaneously measured with the inertial sensors. Step number and temporal gait parameters were calculated from the data recorded by each sensor. Visual inspection and the MTx served as the reference standards for computing the step number and temporal parameters, respectively. Accuracy (error) and precision (variance of error) was assessed based on absolute and relative metrics. Temporal parameters were compared across groups using ANOVA. Results Mean accuracy±precision for the BioStampRC was 2±2 steps error for step number, 6±9ms error for stride time and 6±7ms error for step time (0.6-2.6% relative error). Swing time had the least accuracy±precision (25±19ms error, 5±4% relative error) among the parameters. GT3X had the least accuracy±precision (8±14% relative error) in step number estimateamong the devices. Both MTx and BioStampRC detected significantly distinct gait characteristics between PwMS with different disability levels (p<0.01). Conclusion BioStampRC sensors accurately and precisely measure gait parameters in PwMS across diverse walking impairment levels and detected differences in gait characteristics by disability level in PwMS. This technology has the potential to provide granular monitoring of gait both inside and outside the clinic.","Article","10.1371/JOURNAL.PONE.0171346","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=19326203&id=doi:10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0171346&atitle=Monitoring+gait+in+multiple+sclerosis+with+novel+wearable+motion+sensors&stitle=PLoS+ONE&title=PLoS+ONE&volume=12&issue=2&spage=&epage=&aulast=Moon&aufirst=Yaejin&auinit=Y.&aufull=Moon+Y.&coden=POLNC&isbn=&pages=-&date=2017&auinit1=Y&auinitm=","Embase"

Yet there is no method to objectively measure tremor and effectiveness of interventions on tremor. This study aimed to test validity and reliability of a new objective measurement for upper limb tremor in people with multiple sclerosis. Method: Twelve participants with multiple sclerosis who self-reported tremor were observed performing standardised tasks. Validity and reliability of a new method to detect tremor from wrist movement was established against occupational therapist observation of tremor (FAHN). Concurrent validity of severity (displacement) of tremor was assessed. Responsiveness to change in tremor characteristics was explored in a sub-set of participants using weighted wrist-cuffs. Results: The new method correctly predicted 98.2% of tremor cases identified by the occupational therapist, with high sensitivity (0.988) and specificity (0.976). Calculated displacement of tremor correlated with FAHN tremor severity scores moderately (rs=.452, p=.004). The new measure was responsive to changes in tremor characteristics due to change in weight of wrist-cuffs. Conclusion: The new method of characterising tremor in those with multiple sclerosis demonstrated excellent validity and reliability in relation to tremor identified by an occupational therapist, and could provide valuable objective insight into the efficacy of interventions.","Article","10.1177/0308022617726259","WOS:000412174300004","WoS"

Their levels are tightly maintained in all body organs. Impairment of the Zn2+ to Cu2+ ratio in serum was found to correlate with many disease states, including immunological and inflammatory disorders. Oxytocin (OT) is a neuropeptide, and its activity is modulated by zinc and copper ion binding. Harnessing the intrinsic properties of OT is one of the attractive ways to develop valuable metal ion sensors. Here, we report for the first time an OT-based metal ion sensor prepared by immobilizing the neuropeptide onto a glassy carbon electrode. The developed impedimetric biosensor was ultrasensitive to Zn2+ and Cu2+ ions at physiological pH and not to other biologically relevant ions. Interestingly, the electrochemical impedance signal of two hemicircle systems was recorded after the attachment of OT to the surface. These two semicircles suggest two capacitive regions that result from two different domains in the OT monolayer. Moreover, the change in the charge-transfer resistance of either Zn2+ or Cu2+ was not similar in response to binding. This suggests that the metal-dependent conformational changes of OT can be translated to distinct impedimetric data. Selective masking of Zn2+ and Cu2+ was used to allow for the simultaneous determination of zinc to copper ions ratio by the OT sensor. The OT sensor was able to distinguish between healthy control and multiple sclerosis patients diluted sera samples by determining the Zn/Cu ratio similar to the state-of-the-art techniques. The OT sensor presented herein is likely to have numerous applications in biomedical research and pave the way to other types of neuropeptide-derived sensors.","Article","10.1021/ACSOMEGA.7B01404","WOS:000418744400026","WoS"

Methods: We searched PUBMED, PsycINFO and Web of Science using the keywords physical activity, exercise, and physical fitness in conjunction with MS. We conducted a quantitative synthesis of the difference in physical activity participation levels among persons with MS compared with non-diseased populations and other clinical populations and then examined moderators that might explain variation in the overall effect size (ES). Results: 21 studies were included involving 5303 persons with MS and yielded a mean ES of -0.57 (95% CI=-0.76, 60.37). The weighted mean ES was heterogeneous (Q=443.811, df=31, p < 0.001).

In fact, it interacts with LTD4 (EC(50) 3.15 nM) and UDP (EC(50) 1,779 nM), a cysteinyl-leukotriene and a purinergic receptor agonist, respectively. GPR17 activation leads to both adenylyl cyclase inhibition and intracellular calcium decrease. This receptor, which is highly expressed in organs typically undergoing ischemic damage, plays a key role in the progression of brain injury and cell damage repair. GPR17 has been proposed as a potential pharmacological target for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and traumatic brain injury in humans. In order to pharmacologically characterize the dual profile of GPR17, a new compound designed and synthesized to be able to interact with both the binding sites present in the receptor was tested in comparison with known nucleotides and cysteinyl-leukotriene agonists and antagonists. The experiments were performed using the GloSensor™ cAMP assay that allows to monitor GPCR activity through change in the intracellular cAMP concentration (Figure 1). Figure 1.

A higher level of MVPA in PwMS is associated with improved information processing efficiency, especially in those with lower disease severity scores. However, the construct of information processing efficiency, including both working memory and processing speed is poorly defined, leading to challenges in interpreting these results for PwMS. In the current study, our goal was to examine the differential contributions of MVPA and sedentary behavior in explaining variance in the constructs of working memory and processing speed in PwMS. Forty-four individuals with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis were recruited for the current study. All participants were administered the subtests comprising the Working Memory and Processing Speed Indices of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scales (WAIS-IV) to quantify theoretically sound metrics of working memory and processing speed, respectively. Additionally, all participants wore an Actigraph accelerometer for a 7-day period, which was then used to quantify both MVPA and sedentary behavior. Our results provided evidence for a double dissociation in the associations between physical activity, sedentary behavior and cognitive functioning. Specifically, MVPA was associated with the Working Memory Index, specifically the mental manipulation cluster, such that a higher level of MVPA in PwMS was associated with better performance on tasks of working memory. In contrast, sedentary behavior in PwMS was negatively associated with the Processing Speed Index, such that higher engagement in sedentary behavior was associated with poor performance on measures of processing speed. Future directions for the study include analyzing restingstate data on all participants using graph theory methodology to determine neural correlates of the observed associations. Given the physical limitations experienced by PwMS, these results evince support for the importance of both MVPA as well as reduced sedentary behavior in promoting cognitive health in MS.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458517731285","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458517731285&atitle=Physical+activity+and+sedentary+behavior+in+MS%3A+Impact+on+dissociable+correlates+of+cognitive+functioning&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=23&issue=3&spage=959&epage=&aulast=Prakash&aufirst=R.S.&auinit=R.S.&aufull=Prakash+R.S.&coden=&isbn=&pages=959-&date=2017&auinit1=R&auinitm=S","Embase"

We observed a small transient reduction in barrier strength (in the first 10-14 hours), which was followed by a sustained strengthening by both IL-1β and TNFα (50-500pg/mL). IFNγ mediated a similar change in barrier strength. These responses were concentration dependent with IL-1β being the most potent. In contrast, IFNα caused the immediate strengthening of the barrier, whereas both IL6 and IL4 caused progressive weakening. Even though these cytokines influenced barrier function in different ways as demonstrated by the temporal power of ECIS technology, they each stimulated the brain endothelial cells causing increased secretion of various pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Most of the other factors measured in the sera from the MS patients did not have any influence on the barrier function or viability of the brain endothelial cells used in this study. We conclude that human brain endothelial cells are sensitive to a range of pleiotropic cytokines that are elevated in the sera of patients with RRMS. It is quite plausible that some or a combination of these may influence the BBB integrity and contribute to the leakiness occurring in regions of the brain susceptible to the formation of lesions.","Conference Abstract","10.1186/S12987-017-0071-4","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=20458118&id=doi:10.1186%2Fs12987-017-0071-4&atitle=Real-time+biosensor+technology+reveals+the+temporal+dynamic+changes+in+BBB+endothelial+barrier+strength+following+exposure+to+inflammatory+cytokines+present+in+the+serum+of+MS+patients&stitle=Fluids+Barriers+CNS&title=Fluids+and+Barriers+of+the+CNS&volume=14&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Johnson&aufirst=Rebecca+H.&auinit=R.H.&aufull=Johnson+R.H.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2017&auinit1=R&auinitm=H","Embase"

Objective: We evaluated reliability and validity of a new, sensorbased system for gait analysis in a large group of patients with MS (PwMS) with different disability stages, and healthy controls (HC). Methods: PwMS admitted to the University outpatient clinic or to inpatient rehabilitation, age > 18 years, EDSS ≤ 7.0 and given informed consent were included in the study. Healthy volunteers (hospital staff, relatives and medical students) served as controls. The automatic gait analysis system eGaIT (“embedded gait analysis using intelligent technology”) consists of a small sensor device (accelerometer and gyroscope) laterally attached to both shoes and enables data capturing and analysis, wireless data transfer, feature extraction and gait parameter calculation by pattern recognition algorithms. PwMS and HC were asked to perform the 25-foot walking test (25FWT) two times in a self-selected, comfortable speed (25FWT-slow), followed by two times in a speed as fast as possible (25FWT-fast). Reliability was assessed by correlation analysis between results of the two 25FWT recordings (in slow and fast speed) for different gait parameters (stride length, gait speed, swing time, cadence). Validity was estimated by 1) comparing PwMS with HC, and 2) PwMS subgroups with different disability levels (EDSS ≤ 3.5 and EDSS ≥ 4.0). Results: Between January 2016 and August 2016, 102 PwMS (68% female, mean age 43.0 ± 11.6 years, median EDSS 4.0), and 22 HC (45% female, mean age 34.3 ± 15.6 years) were investigated. Upon comparison of datasets from the first and second measurement, data highly correlated in both, PwMS (i.e. stride length 25FWT-slow, r=0.90, p< 0.001; 25FWT-fast, r=0.91, p< 0.001) and HC (25FWT-slow, r=0.75, p< 0.001; 25FWT-fast, r=0.54, p= 0.03). For all parameters investigated, we found statistically significant differences between HC and PwMS as well as between PwMS subgroups with lower (n=44) versus higher disability (n=58). These differences were more pronounced for 25FWT-fast (i.e. cadence, p< 0.001) than 25FWT-slow (cadence, p=0.033). Conclusion: The eGaIT system is a reliable and valid tool for instrumented gait analysis in PwMS that may easily be administered and objectively supports the clinical workup by detection of gait abnormalities even in the early stages of MS.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458517731404","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458517731404&atitle=Reliability+and+validity+of+a+new%2C+sensor-based+system+for+gait+analysis+in+patients+with+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=23&issue=3&spage=148&epage=149&aulast=Flachenecker&aufirst=F.&auinit=F.&aufull=Flachenecker+F.&coden=&isbn=&pages=148-149&date=2017&auinit1=F&auinitm=","Embase"

One of the classic resulting signs are visual field defects. Careful clinical evaluation is essential to rule in the diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of such disorders. Currently, the routine assessment consist of the Humphrey's test, but it's time consuming and not widely available outside of specialist ophthalmology clinic. Objective: To develop a smartphone application capable of assessing the visual field in order to ultimately diagnose and monitor visual impairment in resource poor settings and be used as a self-monitoring tool for people with Multiple Sclerosis. Method: This pilot study assessed 23 eyes from volunteer patient coming initially for a follow-up in the Royal London Hospital eye clinic. Once results collected, we divided the visual field in 54 zones and compared only the “black zone”, considered as non visualized zone, one after the other. Finally, results were displayed as percentage of match. Results: Six eyes showed a perfect reliability with 100% match, three others presented 50% of reproductivity while three more showed results ranging from 20% to 35%. Finally, 11 obtained a result lower than 20%. The latter is due to an excess of fixation loss, as the reliability of the visual when fixation loss is < 50% is clearly improved (p=0.01). Conclusion: We developed an easy to use smartphone application capable of assessing visual fields. The results showed a promising reliability between Humphrey's tests and the visual App. However the rate of fixation loss still need to be reduced to increase their reliability.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458517731404","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458517731404&atitle=Self-monitoring+visual+function+via+a+smartphone+application&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=23&issue=3&spage=162&epage=&aulast=Dubuisson&aufirst=N.&auinit=N.&aufull=Dubuisson+N.&coden=&isbn=&pages=162-&date=2017&auinit1=N&auinitm=","Embase"

Such assessment is usually based on patients' estimates or on the measures the neurologists observe during periodic visits. Objectives and methods We evaluated the agreement between patients' and neurologists' estimates of maximum walking ability and patients' mean maximum walking ability measured in their daily life through a GPS smartwatch, and assessed limitations of the current methods. Results Seventy-three patients with a median walking ability of 500 m (IQR 400–800) were enrolled in the study. The agreement between patients' estimates and GPS measurements was modest (ICC 0.29, 95% CIs 0.06–0.49) and was influenced by course of the disease, patients' mood and inaccuracy at estimating long distances. A better reliability was found between neurologists' and GPS measures (ICC 0.68, 95% CIs 0.53–0.78), but the variability increased for longer distances and was influenced by patients' depressive symptoms, fatigue and course of the disease. Conclusions This study showed a poor agreement between patients' and neurologists' estimates of maximum walking ability and patients' mean maximum walking ability measured in their daily life through a GPS smartwatch, with many factors affecting patient's and neurologists' estimates of the EDSS.

Sophisticated techniques like 3D gait analysis may reveal subtle changes in gait, but such equipment is not commonly available for clinical routine purposes. Wearable accelerometers are inexpensive and easy to use in clinical setting, but few data are available for people with MS (pwMS) minimally impaired. Aims: To quantitatively and objectively assess possible differences in spatio-temporal (ST) parameters and smoothness of gait between pwMS with low disability and healthy individuals using inertial sensors. Smoothness of gait was calculated from trunk accelerations, using the Harmonic Ratio (HR) parameter. Higher HR values indicate smoother and more stable trunk movement during gait. Methods: Fifty-three pwMS (33F, 20M, 38±9.7 years) with EDSS in the range 0-1 and 41 healthy controls (21F, 20M 39±11.0 years) were enrolled for this study. A wearable triaxial accelerometer was fixed to participant's sacrum and they were requested to walk at self-selected speed for 10 m. Trunk accelerations were processed to calculate ST parameters (i.e. cadence, speed, stride length, stance, swing and double support phase duration) and smoothness of gait through the HR along anterior-posterior (AP), medial-lateral (ML) and vertical (V) directions. One-way MANOVA was performed to detect differences in ST and HR introduced by the pathology. Results: MANOVA revealed no significant differences between the groups for any of the ST parameters. In contrast, significant reduced HR values in AP (2.97 vs 3.73, p<0.001) were observed but not for ML and V directions. Conclusions: While ST parameters of gait in pwMS are not different from those of healthy individuals, the analysis of HR showed that their gait is less smooth in the walking direction. Thus, HR might represent a useful tool to detect early gait impairments in pwMS.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458517701017","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458517701017&atitle=Smoothness+of+gait%2C+but+not+spatio-temporal+parameters%2C+are+altered+in+early+stages+of+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=23&issue=6&spage=898&epage=&aulast=Pau&aufirst=Massimiliano&auinit=M.&aufull=Pau+M.&coden=&isbn=&pages=898-&date=2017&auinit1=M&auinitm=","Embase"

Yawning is observed in MS and other central nervous system disorders and yawning and swallowing may be controlled by the network of the brain stem. Therefore it is important to investigate the MS patients with various clinical and radiological locations in order to understand the role of brainstem on the yawning mechanisms. One hour polygraphic recording would be crucial method for this purpose, because it is easy to observe spontaneous yawning (SY) and spontaneous swallowing (SS) together with their electrophysiologic counterparts. Previous studies reported that contagious yawn and swallow are temporally related and frequency of swallows was increased within 10 s of post yawn period in normal adult subjects. We have re-investigated this phenomenon by studying the SY and SS in polygraphic recording in normal subjects and patients with MS. Then we hypothesized that SY is expected to be increased in MS patients. Methods 49 patients with MS and 19 control subjects were recruited in this study. We used a twelve-channel electroencephalography (EEG) device. Five channels were for electromyography (EMG) recording. We also used one channel for laryngeal sensor for vertical movements of the larynx during swallowing. Cardiac rhythm, respiration and sympathetic skin responses were synchronously recorded during swallowing. We evaluated rate of total SY, swallows inside the yawning, before and after 10 s of the yawning and yawning unrelated with swallowing. Results Patients with MS yawned more frequently than healthy controls (p = 0,044). It was obvious that the yawning unrelated with spontaneous swallow was also significantly increased compared to normal controls (p = 0,047), whereas swallowing inside the yawn or before and after 10 s of yawning were not significantly different in both groups. Among 49 MS patients, 16 (32.6%) had brainstem involvement. Yawning was observed in only 6 (37.5%) of them. Conclusion Yawning is significantly increased in MS patients compared to normal controls by using the polygraphic method. There is no direct relation of the brainstem and the origin of yawning in MS patients according to clinical picture and MRI findings. However safe swallows during yawning could suggest that there is still need to some brain stem mechanism and/or oropharyngeal reflexes.

We here aimed to explore two standard methods (subjective plus objective) to assess PA reduction in PwMS and to describe the relation of PA to health-related quality of life (hrQoL). Methods: PA was objectively measured over a 7-day period in 26 PwMS (EDSS 1.5-6.0) and 30 matched healthy controls (HC) using SenseWear mini® armband (SWAmini) and reported as step count, mean total and activity related energy expenditure (EE) as well as time spent in PA of different intensities. Measures of EE were also derived from self-assessment with IPAQ (International Physical Activity Questionnaire) long version, which additionally yielded information on the context of PA and a classification into subjects' PA levels. To explore the convergence between both types of assessment, IPAQ categories (low, moderate, high) were related to selected PA parameters from objective assessment using ANOVA. Group differences and associated effect sizes for all PA parameters as well as their relation to clinical and hrQoL measures were determined. Results: Both, SWAmini and IPAQ assessment, captured differences in PA between PwMS and HC. IPAQ categories fit well with common cut-offs for step count (p=0.002) and mean METs (p=0.004) to determine PA levels with objective devices. Correlations between specifically matched pairs of IPAQ and SWAmini parameters ranged between r.288 and r.507. Concerning hrQoL, the lower limb mobility subscore was related to four PA measures, while a relation with patients' report of general contentment was only seen for one. Conclusions: Both methods of assessment seem applicable in PwMS and able to describe reductions in daily PA at group level. Whether they can be used to track individual effects of interventions to enhance PA levels needs further exploration. The relation of PA measures with hrQoL seen with lower limb mobility suggests lower limb function not only as a major target for intervention to increase PA but also as a possible surrogate for PA changes.","Article","10.1186/S12883-016-0783-0","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14712377&id=doi:10.1186%2Fs12883-016-0783-0&atitle=Subjective+and+objective+assessment+of+physical+activity+in+multiple+sclerosis+and+their+relation+to+health-related+quality+of+life&stitle=BMC+Neurol.&title=BMC+Neurology&volume=17&issue=1&spage=&epage=&aulast=Kr%C3%BCger&aufirst=Theresa&auinit=T.&aufull=Kr%C3%BCger+T.&coden=BNMEC&isbn=&pages=-&date=2017&auinit1=T&auinitm=","Embase"

With respect to physical activity levels, means (±SD) of light (LA), moderate (MA), vigorous (VA) activities and moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) were 11,660.15±18,145, 212.04±148.67, 9.70±9.26 and 222.88±154.60 counts per minute, respectively. Pearson's correlation analysis showed that WASO correlated significantly with LA, MA and MVPA (P<0.05). These correlations remained significant even after accounting for age, body weight and disease severity (P<0.05). Conclusion The results show a positive relationship of physical activity with sleep parameters in individuals with MS.","Article","10.1016/J.MSARD.2016.12.010","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=22110356&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.msard.2016.12.010&atitle=The+association+between+physical+activity+and+sleep+characteristics+in+people+with+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+Relat.+Disord.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+and+Related+Disorders&volume=12&issue=&spage=29&epage=33&aulast=Aburub&aufirst=Aseel&auinit=A.&aufull=Aburub+A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=29-33&date=2017&auinit1=A&auinitm=","Embase"

The purpose of this study was to examine relationships between trunk and foot acceleration variability during walking in healthy controls and in persons with multiple sclerosis. Methods Linear and nonlinear variability measures were calculated for 40 healthy controls and 40 persons with multiple sclerosis from the acceleration time series recorded by inertial sensors attached to the trunk and foot while subjects walked on a treadmill at self-selected preferred pace. Findings No main effect of group was found for any variability measures. Main effect of location was found for all variability measures, with larger magnitudes of variability at the foot compared to the trunk, and more predictable variability patterns at the foot compared to the trunk. Differences in strength of correlations between trunk and foot accelerations were found between persons with multiple sclerosis and healthy controls in the frontal and sagittal plane. Sample entropy of accelerations at the feet and at the trunk correlated significantly higher in healthy controls than in persons with multiple sclerosis. Interpretation Relationships between variability of trunk and foot accelerations, which may provide a valuable comprehensive description of whole body stability during gait, showed minor changes in persons with MS compared to healthy controls.","Article","10.1016/J.CLINBIOMECH.2017.07.011","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=18791271&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.clinbiomech.2017.07.011&atitle=The+relationship+between+trunk+and+foot+acceleration+variability+during+walking+shows+minor+changes+in+persons+with+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Clin.+Biomech.&title=Clinical+Biomechanics&volume=49&issue=&spage=16&epage=21&aulast=Craig&aufirst=Jordan+J.&auinit=J.J.&aufull=Craig+J.J.&coden=CLBIE&isbn=&pages=16-21&date=2017&auinit1=J&auinitm=J","Embase"

Setting: Clinical Laboratory. Participants: Ten persons with Multiple Sclerosis with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) 2.5-6.5. Interventions: Muscle function and walking ability were evaluated in ten persons with MS.Main Outcome Measure(s)Muscle oxidative capacity was measured in the medial gastrocnemius using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) following 15-20 seconds of electrical stimulation; muscle endurance was evaluated in the medial gastrocnemius using accelerometer-based mechanomyography during 9 minutes of twitch electrical stimulation, in three stages (3min/stage) of increasing frequency (2Hz, 4Hz, and 6Hz); muscle strength (plantar flexion) was measured using a maximal voluntary contraction (MVC). Walking function was measured using the Timed 25-Foot Walk Test (T25FWT) and the Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT). Results: Muscle oxidative capacity and muscle endurance were correlated with 6MWT distance (r(2)=0.89 and 0.78, respectively; p < 0.01).

Aim: To assess the usefulness of a smartphone-based e-diary to the estimation of adherence to disease modifying drugs (DMDs), as well as to the collection of patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Methods: Patients downloaded a MS tailored e-diary into their personal smartphones. The application prompted patients to take their DMDs and recorded their adherence. Report of PROs was conveyed once monthly through the application, using previously validated tools (Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life inventory, Neuro-QoL short forms and CNS lability scale). Adherence data from the e-diary was compared to medication pack collection. PROs gathered by the e-diary were compared to corresponding functional system scores, determined by neurologic examination, as well as to patients' subjective reports during routine follow up visits, as documented in their electronic medical record (EMR). Results: Data from 83 PwMS was used in this analysis [Female: 54 (65%), EDSS 3.4±2.1]. Patients were using the e-diary for a median duration of 17 weeks [range:4-29 weeks]. Only 7 patients (8%) dropped out and another 3 (3%) did not agree to participate in PRO survey but continued to report their medication intake. Adherence to DMDs as reported in the e-diary was 87.1±17.8% compared to 84 ±19.2% according to pack collection. E-diary derived PROs were significantly correlated with the corresponding functional system scores (0.46< r < 0.8, P< 0.0001). The E-diary captured more MS related symptoms than documented in the EMR (e-diary compared to EMR: poor sleep 49% vs. 5%, pseudobulbar affect 17% vs 3%, upper limb dysfunction 10% vs 3% of participants). In patients with a relapse we noted increased PRO scores, which decreased following remission. Conclusion: Smartphone-based e-diary seems suitable for PwMS and can provide useful information regarding PROs and adherence to DMDs.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458517731285","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458517731285&atitle=The+use+of+a+mobile-phone-based+E-diary+for+evaluation+of+patient-reported+outcomes+and+adherence+to+treatment+of+patients+with+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=23&issue=3&spage=739&epage=&aulast=Golan&aufirst=D.&auinit=D.&aufull=Golan+D.&coden=&isbn=&pages=739-&date=2017&auinit1=D&auinitm=","Embase"

Timed up and go (TUG) is a widely used measure of functional mobility and an instrumented TUG which make use of inertial sensors has been recently tested in MS (Pau et al., 2017). This approach allows obtaining time, acceleration and velocities of each TUG sub-phase (i.e. sit-tostand, intermediate and final turning, stand-to-sit). In addition, as it is based on open-task, TUG evaluate also programming, planning, navigation and other executive functions. Since clinical disabilities, especially motor and cognitive impairment, are highly related to brain atrophy (Charil, A., et al., 2006), and TUG is able to combine these abilities in a single task, the purpose of this study was to evaluate relationship between brain volumes and instrumented TUG (iTUG) performances. Methods: Inclusion criteria for enrollment were a diagnosis of MS according to McDonald criteria and been able to walk at least 20m. iTUG was performed using a wearable inertial sensor as previously reported by Pau et al. Times and velocities of TUG subphases were calculated by processing the trunk accleeration data. .All patients underwent to a brain MRI and volumes of whole brain (WB), white matter (WM), grey matter (GM) and cortical GM (C) were estimated with SIENAX (Smith et al., 2002). Relationship between brain volumes and TUG parameters were assessed by means of Spearman correlation. Results: Sixty patients were enrolled (19 male); mean age was 41.5±11.6 years and mean EDSS was 2.3±1.2. The following significant correlations were found: total TUG duration with WB (Rho=0.270 p=0.038), WM (Rho=0.358 p=0.005), GM (Rho=0.309 p=0.017), C (Rho=0.317 p=0.014); for intermediate turning: mean velocity with WB (Rho=0.365 p=0.004), WM (Rho=0.331 p=0.10), GM (Rho= 0.427 p=0.001), C (Rho=0.380 p=0.003), and maximal velocity with WB (Rho= 0.274 p=0.035), GM (Rho=0.377 p=0.003), C (Rho=0.351 p=0.006).

Potential benefits include improved lower-limb function and a more typical gait trajectory. Statement of Conclusions: Use of these devices is limited by insufficient data, cost, and in some cases size of the machine. However, robotic technology is likely to become more prevalent as these machines are enhanced and able to produce targeted physical rehabilitation.

However, clinical postural control assessment is mostly based on subjective scales or standard neurological examinations, which show poor sensitivity to identify early impairment. The purpose of this pilot-study was to assess the validity and reliability of a tandem stance balance test based on the use of smartphone-accelerometry to assess postural control in minimally-impaired MS patients. Methods: Ten patients (7 women, 3 men; Median age = 43.0 yrs) with relapsing-remitting MS (EDSS < 3) performed the balance test (six trials of 70 s) twice, spaced 2 weeks apart. A force platform (Model 9286AA; Kistler, Switzerland) and a smartphone (Model Huawei G8; Huawei, China) were used to measure the oscillation of the centre of pressure (COP) and pelvis acceleration respectively. Pearson correlations were used to assess concurrentvalidity between COP sway and pelvis-acceleration. Typical error (TE) and intraclass-correlation coefficient (ICC3,1) were used to assess the absolute and relative reliability of the smartphone acceleration scores. Results: Correlational analyses showed moderate to high significant correlation between acceleration scores and COP oscillations (0.67 < r < 0.84). In addition, smartphone scores showed moderate absolute (15.2% < TE < 18.4%) and high relative (0.79 < ICC < 0.92) test-retest reliability. Conclusions: Based on correlational and reliability analyses, smartphone-accelerometry seems a valid, reliable and sensitive tool to assess postural control in patients with relapsing-remitting MS. Therefore, it may be useful to detect early postural control impairment in patients with MS in clinical setting.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458517731406","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458517731406&atitle=Validity+and+reliability+of+smartphone-accelerometry+for+the+measurement+of+postural+control+in+people+with+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=23&issue=3&spage=477&epage=&aulast=Barbado&aufirst=D.&auinit=D.&aufull=Barbado+D.&coden=&isbn=&pages=477-&date=2017&auinit1=D&auinitm=","Embase"

Validity of the activPAL3 accelerometer was compared to video observation in 20 people moderately affected by MS. Participants walked 20–30 m twice along a straight quiet corridor at a comfortable speed. Inter-rater reliability of video observations was excellent (all intraclass correlations >0.99).

One of the MSOAC goals is acceptance and qualification by regulators of performance outcomes that are highly reliable and valid, practical, cost-effective, and meaningful in MS. This article addresses the history, application, and psychometric properties of one such MSOAC metric of ambulation or walking namely, the timed 25-foot walk (T25FW). The T25FW has strong reliability over both brief and long periods of time in MS across a large range of disability levels. The outcome of walking speed from the T25FW has obvious real-world relevance and has correlated strongly with other measures of walking and lower extremity function.

One of the MSOAC goals is acceptance and qualification by regulators of performance outcomes that are highly reliable and valid, practical, cost-effective, and meaningful in MS. This article addresses the history, application, and psychometric properties of one such MSOAC metric of ambulation or walking namely, the timed 25-foot walk (T25FW). The T25FW has strong reliability over both brief and long periods of time in MS across a large range of disability levels. The outcome of walking speed from the T25FW has obvious real-world relevance and has correlated strongly with other measures of walking and lower extremity function. The T25FW is responsive for capturing intervention effects in pharmacological and rehabilitation trials and has an established value for capturing clinically meaningful change in ambulation.

Background: To date outcomes research in MS has centered on periodic clinical exams. These have been generally insensitive to changes over the short term and are semi-quantitative, single snapshots of the patient's performance. With the mass production of sensors in the gaming and computer control industry, there is an opportunity to transform the traditional neurological exam with biosensors already in use outside the realm of health applications. Design/Methods: Consecutive subjects with any MS subtype evaluated in a tertiary care MS Center were offered enrollment if they had an expanded disability status scale score (EDSS) < 6.5. Healthy controls were enrolled if they had no history of MS or other physically or cognitively disabling illness. Case subjects completed patient reported outcome questionnaires (self-report EDSS, WHODAS) and the physician completed standard EDSS exam. Surface EMG data were captured during finger taps and foot taps through use of the wearable device. Results: We enrolled 59 MS subjects (66% female, ages 21-75) with median disease duration 8.3 years and median EDSS 3.0. Eighteen controls have been enrolled (61% female, ages 23-54). The mean WHODAS score for the MS subjects was 15.3. There was strong correlation of asymmetry in limb function detected by surface EMG with EDSS score (R(2)0.75, p=0.006) and pyramidal (R(2)0.57, p=0.018) and cerebellar (R(2)0.65, p=0.0045) function. Analyses are in progress for self-reported patient outcomes and machine learning extracted features. Conclusions: Clinically relevant associations were observed with wearable EMG extracted metrics. The device, which can be inserted into clinical practice without significant disruption to the standard neurological exam, could also facilitate remote monitoring of patients, and has implications for multiple other neurodegenerative diseases.","Conference Abstract",NA,"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=1526632X&id=doi:&atitle=Wearable+electromyogram+device+associated+with+disability+outcomes+in+adults+with+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Neurology&title=Neurology&volume=88&issue=16&spage=&epage=&aulast=Graves&aufirst=Jennifer&auinit=J.&aufull=Graves+J.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2017&auinit1=J&auinitm=","Embase"

Compared to level walking, stair negotiation is a significantly more biomechanically demanding task, highly associated to falls [1]. For these reasons, 43 clinical tests include an item on stair negotiation, which is assessed by ratings on an ordinal scale or through a stopwatch [2]. Although widely used, these scales provide little information about different aspects of the task. (table presented) Aimof this study was thedevelopment and application of amethod, based on a single inertial sensor (IMU), for the instrumented analysis of stair climbing in 3 groups of subjects with Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's Disease (PD) and stroke (ST). Methods: 30 subjects (age: 60 ± 15 yrs) with neurological diseases (10 with MS, 10 with PD and 10 with ST) and 20 healthy subjects (HC, age: 58 ± 14 yrs) were asked to climb 10 steps, as described in the mDGI clinical test (Item 8), wearing one IMU (Xsens, NL) positionedon the sternum with an elastic band. The following features were computed from accelerometric and angular signals: step frequency (peak frequency of the power spectrum of vertical acceleration), step symmetry and stride regularity (respectively, the first and second peak of the autocor relation function of acceleration modulus [3]), gait smoothness (harmonic ratios of vertical (HRV), medio-lateral (HRML) and antero-posterior (HRAP) accelerations [4]), trunk AP and ML sway (standard deviation of trunk pitch and roll angles of the IMU). Between-group comparison was performed using ANOVA and Bonferroni-Holm post-hoc test. Results: No statistically significant difference among the 3 pathological groups was found in mDGI-Item 8 clinical score (MS: 5.0 ± 1.7 pts; PD: 6.5 ± 1.4 pts; ST: 6.0 ± 1.8 pts). Instead, instrumental parameters (Table 1) showed a significant reduction of step frequencyinall groups of patients comparedtoHC, while step symmetry, stride regularity and gait smoothness was reduced only in MS and ST subjects. Trunk AP sway was significantly increased in MS patients comparedto all the other groups, while trunk MLsway showed a significant reduction in PD with respect to HCand people with MS. Discussion: MS group showed the greatest alterations in stair climbing, as revealed by the worsening of all spatio-temporal aspects(stepfrequency, symmetry, regularity and smoothness)and by a significant increase of trunk AP sway, the latter suggesting a decreased axial stability. ST showed alterations in spatiotemporal aspects but not in trunk kinematics, while PD showed spatio-temporal parameters comparable to normative data, and a significant reduction of step frequency and trunk ML sway that can be ascribed to bradykinesia and rigidity. These preliminary results suggest that the proposed method is a quick and easy tool, which can discriminate healthy subjects from patients with different neurological disorders, and provide quantitative data about different components of stair climbing to complement clinical assessments. More subjects must be tested to confirm the present findings.","Conference Abstract","10.1016/J.GAITPOST.2017.07.078","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=18792219&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.gaitpost.2017.07.078&atitle=Wearable-sensor+based+pilot+assessment+of+stair+ascending+in+three+neurological+diseases&stitle=Gait+Posture&title=Gait+and+Posture&volume=57&issue=&spage=22&epage=23&aulast=Carpinella&aufirst=I.&auinit=I.&aufull=Carpinella+I.&coden=&isbn=&pages=22-23&date=2017&auinit1=I&auinitm=","Embase"

Major improvements in acute care and diagnostics have created a tendency toward the chronification of formerly terminal conditions, requiring people with these conditions to learn how to self-manage. Mobile technologies hold promise as self-management tools due to their ubiquity and cost-effectiveness. The delivery of health-related services through mobile technologies (mobile health, mHealth) has grown exponentially in recent years. However, only a fraction of these solutions take into consideration the views of relevant stakeholders such as health care professionals or even patients. The use of behavioral change models (BCMs) has proven important in developing successful health solutions, yet engaging patients remains a challenge. There is a trend in mHealth solutions called gamification that attempts to use game elements to drive user behavior and increase engagement. As it stands, designers of mHealth solutions for behavioral change in chronic conditions have no clear way of deciding what factors are relevant to consider. Objective: The goal of this work is to discover factors for the design of mHealth solutions for chronic patients using negotiations between medical knowledge, BCMs, and gamification. Methods: This study uses an embedded case study research methodology consisting of 4 embedded units: 1) cross-sectional studies of mHealth applications; 2) statistical analysis of gamification presence; 3) focus groups and interviews to relevant stakeholders; and 4) research through design of an mHealth solution. The data obtained was thematically analyzed to create a conceptual model for the design of mHealth solutions. Results: The Model for Motivational Mobile-health Design (3MD) for chronic conditions guides the design of condition-oriented gamified behavioral change mHealth solutions. The main components are (1) condition specific, which describe factors that need to be adjusted and adapted for each particular chronic condition; (2) motivation related, which are factors that address how to influence behaviors in an engaging manner; and (3) technology based, which are factors that are directly connected to the technical capabilities of mobile technologies. The 3MD also provides a series of high-level illustrative design questions for designers to use and consider during the design process. Conclusions: This work addresses a recognized gap in research and practice, and proposes a unique model that could be of use in the generation of new solutions to help chronic patients.","Article","10.2196/11631","WOS:000447303400004","WoS"

Impaired PwMS ambulation causes disability. Current approaches documenting gait disease impact/progression including EDSS/T25FW are insufficiently sensitive to identify/quantify/document critical subtle granular objective impact/progression. This information might improve disease modifying therapy choice (e.g. efficacy, timing of change). Objective analyses approaches have included digital devices of varying types utilizing different transducers (e.g. foot pressure, accelerometer). Comparing different technologies in PwMS with varying disability levels is important to determine optimal technology approach. Objectives: Compare objective quantified outcome parameters produced by devices utilizing different validated technology, explore continuity/discontinuity of “concordant” digitized values. Methods: PwMS performed 25-foot walk-(T25FW) on GAITRite-mat while wearing G-walk simultaneously. Univariate regression modeling evaluated relationships between 11 outcome parameters (Gait Domains=GD) produced by both devices. Relationships were grouped by correlation strength: high-(r≥0.50), medium-(0.30≤r≤0.49), low-(r≤0.29). Results: 23PwMS (52% female, average age =51.7±11.5 years, EDSS 2-6.5) GD analysis revealed: 67% (7/11) high-strength correlations-swing-phase duration left-leg (r=0.62, p<.01), % gait-cycle single-support right-leg (r=0.54, p<.01), % gait-cycle double-support left-leg (r=0.69, p<0.001), ambulation-time (r=0.65, p<0.001), cadence (r=0.91, p<0.001), cycle-time (right-leg r=0.84, p<0.001; left-leg r=0.68, p<0.001); 9% (1/11) medium strength correlations-swing-phase duration right-leg (r=0.44, p<.05); and 27% (3/11) low strength correlations-%-gait-cycle single-support left-leg (r=0.22, p>0.30), %-gait-cycle double-support right-leg (r=0.23, p>0.20), velocity (r=0.20, p>0.30). Conclusion: Objective quantified gait parameters obtained by different technologies might provide discordant/insensitive results despite “measuring” equivalent outcomes. 67% of parameters had strong correlations between devices, 33% had medium or low correlations (r<0.50) including gait velocity. Discrepancies raise concerns regarding data validity produced by one/both devices utilizing varied technology and across devices/disability comparisons.

The benefits of technology in healthcare have been demonstrated in many health conditions. This study aims to seek the views of People with multiple sclerosis (MS) of the feasibility and perceived acceptability of smartphone use for healthcare purposes.METHODS: Using SurveyMonkey™, respondents answered 21 items about their smartphone use and acceptance of smartphones in healthcare. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize data from closed questions. Content analysis was used for open questions.RESULTS: Most of the self-selected 197 respondents were female (138/197;70.1%), aged 42.78 ± 10.29 years, had relapsing-remitting MS (143/187;76.5%), and mobilized without an aid (154/197;78.17%). Most respondents reported having smartphone access (174/191;91.1%) and owning smartphones (167/192;86.97%). Perceived benefits of smartphones included improved healthcare access (119/190;62.63%) and greater independence (124/190;65.26%). The top three concerns included reduced contact with Healthcare Professionals (66/186;35.48%), data security (60/186;32.26%) and visual impairment (47/184;25.54%).CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that smartphone use is extensive, frequent, and acceptable for healthcare purposes in this self-selected sample.

Objective: To estimate longitudinal change in the daily averages of 12 free-living biosensor measurements collected in 23 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and to compare the measurements in different severity groups. Methods: 25 MS patients were enrolled in a biosensor study at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Patients wore digital biosensors during three in-clinic visits and eight weeks continuously at home between the second and third visit. 23 patients (96% females, baseline mean age 46.4±7.7) completed the at home period. Patients wore three biosensors (wrist, ankle and sternum) and 12 average daily free-living measurements were derived. Patients were stratified into three groups based on baseline Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score (0.0-2.5 = 10 subjects (~44%), 3.0-4.5 = 6 subjects (~26%), and ≥5.0 = 7 subjects (~30%)). Linear mixed effects regression models assessed longitudinal change in daily free-living measurements with fixed effects for time, baseline severity groups, and time by group interaction as well as a random intercept and slope. Results: Four free-living features including stance time (p=0.0036), swing time (p=0.0083), max turn velocity ankle (p=0.0278), and turn velocity ankle SD (p=0.0078) showed significant difference in the three severity groups. There was no significant change in the measures over time or difference in the longitudinal change between groups. During this same period, there were no clinically significant changes in disease status observed within any individuals as measured by EDSS. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that a novel digital biosensor signature correlated with baseline physician severity ratings using EDSS. The biosensor data was acquired without patient effort in the free-living environment, suggesting that home biosensor tracking may substitute for, or supplement in-office physician assessment for monitoring MS.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458518798592","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458518798592&atitle=Analysis+of+longitudinal+free-living+features+from+wearable+biosensors+in+multiple+sclerosis+patients&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=24&issue=2&spage=759&epage=760&aulast=Gonzalez&aufirst=C.&auinit=C.&aufull=Gonzalez+C.&coden=&isbn=&pages=759-760&date=2018&auinit1=C&auinitm=","Embase"

[3] Most of the studies assessing WOS were performed in natural beach environment, investigating energy consumption [1]. The quantitative analysis of joint kinematics and mechanical work has been performed using stereophotogrammetry and force platform, respectively, only in controlled laboratory conditions [2,4], with difficulties in the replication of the sand surface and far from an ecological evaluation of WOS. Thanks to their portability and limited invasiveness, inertial measurements units (IMUs) allow kinematic measurement out of the laboratory. The present work aims to characterize WOS, analysing the estimation of gait temporal parameters (GPTs) from IMU's data in three different conditions: hard surface, wet and dry sand. Methods: Five healthy subjects (3F,2M; 35±7years; 171.5±11.5m; 60.8±7.5kg) were recruited for the study. Measures of angular velocity were collected using two tri-axial IMUs (Cometa, Italy, fc142Hz) located on the lower shanks. Participants completed three walking tasks at self-selected speed in different conditions: hard surface (even concrete blocks), wet and dry sand. The same walking tasks were also filmed using a GoPro (Hero4, USA, fc120Hz). IMU led flashing was video-recorded and used for synchronization. For each participant and each condition, 96 steps were analysed, being the minimum number of steps available in all conditions. Gait events identified from videos were assumed as reference. From IMUs, GEs were identified using the algorithm by Salarian et al. [5] (previously validated for walking on hard surfaces). GPTs (i.e. stance, step, stride and swing time) were derived from GEs in all three conditions. The error was defined as the difference between GTPs estimated from IMU against GoPro. Dispersion around median value of the errors (Dm) was calculated as 75(th) percentile minus 25(th) percentile value of the error. A linear mixed model was adopted to perform statistical analysis using R software (R-Core Team., Austria, 2017) Results: Error in stance and swing time detection significantly increased from hard surface (Stance Dm 56ms; Swing Dm: 55ms) to wet (59ms; 56ms) and dry sand (137ms; 138ms) condition. Conversely, no difference was found in stride and step detection errors (Fig. 1a). Successively, the estimated stride and step time were found to be different across all conditions increased from hard surface to dry sand (Fig. 1b). Discussion: Even though errors in stance and swing time tended to triple from hard surface to dry sand condition, preliminary accuracy results suggest that the use of IMUs for the estimation of GTPs can be adopted in gait performance assessment. Findings from this study warned to be cautious on the interpretation of increasing trend associated to stance and swing time across different conditions, since this variation resulted to be lower than accuracy in their estimation. Future research will focus on assessing more accurate methods to obtain a comprehensive characterization of WOS in real and ecological conditions.","Conference Abstract","10.1016/J.GAITPOST.2018.07.146","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=18792219&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.gaitpost.2018.07.146&atitle=Analysis+of+temporal+gait+parameters+during+walking+on+sand+using+inertial+wearable+sensors&stitle=Gait+Posture&title=Gait+and+Posture&volume=66&issue=&spage=S29&epage=S30&aulast=Panebianco&aufirst=G.+Pacini&auinit=G.P.&aufull=Panebianco+G.P.&coden=&isbn=&pages=S29-S30&date=2018&auinit1=G&auinitm=P","Embase"

Physical activities that older people in hospital commonly engage in include exercises and walking. Measurement of physical activity levels of older inpatients is essential to evaluate the impact of interventions to improve physical activity levels and to determine associations between physical activity in hospital and other health-related outcome measures. Objective: To determine which measures are used to measure physical activity of older people in hospital, and to describe their properties and applications. Method: A systematic review of four databases: Medline, Embase, CINAHL and AMED was conducted for papers published from 1996 to 2016. Inclusion criteria were participants aged ≥ 65 years and studies which included measures of physical activity in the acute medical inpatient setting. Studies which specifically assessed the activity levels of surgical patients or patients with neurological conditions such as stroke or brain injury were excluded. All study designs were included in the review. Results: 18 studies were included from 127 articles selected for full review. 15 studies used objective measures to measure the physical activity of older inpatients: 11 studies used accelerometers and four used direct systematic observations. Seven accelerometers were identified including the StepWatch Activity Monitor, activPAL, GENEActiv, Kenz Lifecorder EX, Actiwatch-L, Tractivity and AugmenTech Inc. Pittsburgh accelerometer. Three studies used a subjective measure (interviews with nurses and patients) to classify patients into low, intermediate and high mobility groups. The StepWatch Activity Monitor was reported to be most accurate at step-counting in patients with slow gait speed or altered gait. The activPAL was reported to be highly accurate at classifying postures. Conclusion: Physical activity levels of older inpatients can be measured using accelerometers. The accuracy of the accelerometers varies between devices and population-specific validation studies are needed to determine their suitability in measuring physical activity levels of hospitalised older people. Subjective measures are less accurate but can be a practical way of measuring physical activity in a larger group of patients.","Review","10.1007/S12603-017-0931-2","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=17604788&id=doi:10.1007%2Fs12603-017-0931-2&atitle=Assessment+of+Physical+Activity+of+Hospitalised+Older+Adults%3A+A+Systematic+Review&stitle=J.+Nutr.+Health+Aging&title=Journal+of+Nutrition%2C+Health+and+Aging&volume=22&issue=3&spage=377&epage=386&aulast=Lim&aufirst=Stephen+E.+R.&auinit=S.E.R.&aufull=Lim+S.E.R.&coden=JNHAF&isbn=&pages=377-386&date=2018&auinit1=S&auinitm=E.R.","Embase"

However, objective assessment of balance usually requires clinical expertise and/or the use of expensive and obtrusive measuring equipment. These barriers to the objective assessment of balance may be overcome with the development of a lightweight inertial sensor system. In this study, we examined the concurrent validity of a novel wireless, skin-mounted inertial sensor system (BioStamp®, MC10 Inc.) to measure postural sway in individuals with MS by comparing measurement agreement between this novel sensor and gold standard measurement tools (force plate and externally validated inertial sensor). A total of 39 individuals with MS and 15 healthy controls participated in the study. Participants with MS were divided into groups based on the amount of impairment (MS(Mild): EDSS 2-4, n = 19; MS(Severe): EDSS ≥6, n = 20). The balance assessment consisted of two 30-s quiet standing trials in each of three conditions: Eyes open/firm surface, eyes closed/firm surface, and eyes open/foam surface. For each trial, postural sway was recorded with a force plate (Bertec) and simultaneously using two accelerometers (BioStamp and Xsens) mounted on the participant's posterior trunk at L5. Sway metrics (sway area, sway path length, root mean square amplitude, mean velocity, JERK, and total power) were derived to compare the measurement agreement among the measurement devices. Excellent agreement (intraclass correlation coefficients >0.9) between sway metrics derived from the BioStamp and the MTx sensors were observed across all conditions and groups. Good to excellent correlations (r >0.7) between devices were observed in all sway metrics and conditions. Additionally, the acceleration sway metrics were nearly as effective as the force plate sway metrics in differentiating individuals with poor balance from healthy controls. Overall, the BioStamp sensor is a valid and objective measurement tool for postural sway assessment. This novel, lightweight and portable sensor may offer unique advantages in tracking patient's postural performance.","Article","10.1159/000485958","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=2504110X&id=doi:10.1159%2F000485958&atitle=Assessment+of+postural+sway+in+individuals+with+multiple+sclerosis+using+a+novel+wearable+inertial+sensor&stitle=Digit.+Biomarkers&title=Digital+Biomarkers&volume=2&issue=1&spage=1&epage=10&aulast=Sun&aufirst=Ruopeng&auinit=R.&aufull=Sun+R.&coden=&isbn=&pages=1-10&date=2018&auinit1=R&auinitm=","Embase"

However, dynamic balance disorders are difficult to assess in clinical practice. We performed three studies to profile balance disorders during gait of PwMS. The first one was aimed to develop and compare different indexes to describe dynamic balance using instrumented gait analysis. We assessed 14 PwMS aged (Mean±Standard Deviation) 49.25±8.0 years, with an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 5.4±1.25 points and we found that indexes related to Head motion and Body Centre of Mass motion seem valid to describe dynamic balance control. In a second study we developed a new assessment tool based on wearable sensors to evaluate the balance and gait adaptability in a clinical environment. Ten PwMS (mean age of 49.5±17.7 years, all with EDSS lower than 6.5) were assessed using Inertial Measurement Units while performing balance tasks. Our results showed that PwMS, when compared to healthy subjects, show more impairment in trunk control than in indexes related to step frequency and regularity. In the third, ongoing study, we are focusing on subject's ability to walk in everyday life environment and to verify which of the indexes provided by wrist-worn actigraphic devices are more associated to participation restrictions. In conclusion, dynamic balance assessment can be used as a guidance for clinicians to detect PwMS having balance disorders that are associated with participation restrictions and to analyze changes in balance control in the clinical environment and during the activities of daily living.","Conference Abstract",NA,"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:&atitle=Balance+assessment+to+unravel+participation+restrictions+in+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=24&issue=6&spage=873&epage=&aulast=Cattaneo&aufirst=Davide&auinit=D.&aufull=Cattaneo+D.&coden=&isbn=&pages=873-&date=2018&auinit1=D&auinitm=","Embase"

Methods: Balance control during stance and gait tasks of 24 remitting-phase patients (mean age 43.7 ± 10.5, 15 women, mean EDSS at baseline 2.45 ± 1.01) was examined every 3 months over 9 months and compared to that of nine relapsing patients (age 42.0 ± 12.7, all women, mean EDSS at relapse onset 3.11 ± 0.96) examined at relapse onset and 3 months later. Balance was also compared to that of 40 healthy controls (HCs) (age 39.7 ± 12.6, 25 women). Balance control was measured as lower-trunk sway angles with body-worn gyroscopes. Expanded Disability Status Scale scores (EDSS) were used to monitor, clinically, disease progression. Results: Remitting-phase patients showed more unstable stance balance control than HCs (p < 0.04) with no worsening over the observation period of 9 months. Gait balance control was normal (p > 0.06). Relapsing patients had stance balance control significantly worse at onset compared to remitting-phase patients and HCs (p < 0.04). Gait tasks showed a significant decrease of gait speed and trunk sway in relapsing patients (p = 0.018) compatible with having increased gait instability at normal speeds. Improvement to levels of remitting patients generally took longer than 3 months. Balance and EDSS scores were correlated for remitting but not for relapse patients. Conclusions: Balance in remitting RRMS patients does not change significantly over 9 months and correlated well with EDSS scores. Our results indicate that balance control is a useful measure to assess recovery after a relapse, particularly in patients with unchanged EDSS scores. Based on our results, balance could be considered as additional measurement to assess recovery after a relapse, particularly in patients with unchanged EDSS.","Article","10.3389/FNEUR.2018.00686","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=16642295&id=doi:10.3389%2Ffneur.2018.00686&atitle=Balance+changes+in+patients+with+relapsing-remitting+multiple+sclerosis%3A+A+pilot+study+comparing+the+dynamics+of+the+relapse+and+remitting+phases&stitle=Front.+Neurol.&title=Frontiers+in+Neurology&volume=9&issue=AUG&spage=&epage=&aulast=Findling&aufirst=Oliver&auinit=O.&aufull=Findling+O.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2018&auinit1=O&auinitm=","Embase"

Therefore, RORγt has attracted much attention as a target receptor for the treatment of inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel diseases, and psoriasis. This study aims to characterize TAK-828F, a potent and selective RORγt inverse agonist. Methods: The biochemical properties of TAK-828F were evaluated using Time-Resolved Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (TR-FRET) binding assay, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor assay, cofactor recruitment assay, reporter assay, and IL-17 expression assay. Results: TR-FRET binding assay and SPR biosensor assay revealed rapid, reversible, and high affinity binding of TAK-828F to RORγt. The cofactor recruitment assay showed that TAK-828F inhibited the recruitment of steroid receptor coactivator-1 to RORγt. Furthermore, TAK-828F inhibited the transcriptional activity of human and mouse RORγt with selectivity against human RORα and RORβ. TAK-828F also suppressed IL-17 production in Jurkat cells, overexpressing human RORγt. Conclusion: These favorable properties will be of advantage in the evaluation of TAK-828F in clinical studies for inflammatory diseases. Furthermore, these findings demonstrate that TAK-828F could serve as a pharmacological tool for further studies of RORγt and inflammatory diseases.","Article","10.1159/000492226","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14230313&id=doi:10.1159%2F000492226&atitle=Biochemical+properties+of+TAK-828F%2C+a+potent+and+selective+retinoid-related+orphan+receptor+gamma+t+inverse+agonist&stitle=Pharmacology&title=Pharmacology&volume=102&issue=5-6&spage=244&epage=252&aulast=Nakagawa&aufirst=Hideyuki&auinit=H.&aufull=Nakagawa+H.&coden=PHMGB&isbn=&pages=244-252&date=2018&auinit1=H&auinitm=","Embase"

The purpose of this study was to evaluate segmental control during quiet standing in PwMS and controls to understand whether MS alters use of the ankle and hip strategies to manage postural sway. Coherence of acceleration between the trunk and legs was evaluated with accelerometers placed on the sacrum and lower leg. Thirty-six PwMS and 20 healthy control subjects performed quiet standing with eyes open and closed while center of pressure (CoP) and acceleration of postural sway was measured. Acceleration frequencies were divided into lower frequencies (≤1.0 Hz) and higher frequencies (>1.0 Hz) to categorize sway characteristics. With eyes open, coherence was significantly lower in PwMS compared to controls at lower frequencies only. With eyes closed, coherence was significantly lower in PwMS compared to controls, who use an ankle strategy at lower frequencies only, at both lower and higher frequencies. Both groups showed decreased coherence with increasing frequency when eyes were open and closed. Coherence was significantly correlated with CoP sway area in PwMS during the eyes closed condition only. The reduced coherence in PwMS during both lower and higher frequency sway indicates PwMS utilize a mixed ankle-hip sway strategy regardless of sway frequency. This is in contrast to sway in healthy subjects which utilizes an ankle strategy at lower frequencies and a mixed strategy at higher frequencies. Lack of adaptability in segmental control strategy likely contributes to abnormal postural control, as reflected by CoP sway patterns, in PwMS.","Article","10.1016/J.HUMOV.2017.12.009","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=18727646&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.humov.2017.12.009&atitle=Coherence+analysis+of+trunk+and+leg+acceleration+reveals+altered+postural+sway+strategy+during+standing+in+persons+with+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Hum.+Mov.+Sci.&title=Human+Movement+Science&volume=58&issue=&spage=330&epage=336&aulast=Huisinga&aufirst=Jessie&auinit=J.&aufull=Huisinga+J.&coden=HMSCD&isbn=&pages=330-336&date=2018&auinit1=J&auinitm=","Embase"

STEPS measured using remote accelerometry provides granular, continuous information about physical activity in real-world settings. Design/Methods: Adults with MS (relapsing or progressive) able to walk at least 2 minutes were prospectively recruited into the UCSF FITriMS cohort.

Results: Of 96 participants (61 relapsing MS, 35 progressive MS), 79 have completed 1-year follow-up (retention 82.3%); 9 withdrew, and 8 were lost to follow-up. Over 1 year, for the entire cohort, STEPS decreased 10.7% (mean decrease: 1236 steps/day, SD: 3065), and 53.4% decreased STEPS more than 800 steps/day (a proposed Minimal Clinically Important Difference threshold).

Method: A total of 15 pairs of PwMS and their family caregivers wore accelerometers for 7 days. By collecting data simultaneously from both partners, we tested interdependence using the dyad as the unit of analysis. Results: PwMS and caregivers averaged 4,091.3 (SD 2,726.3) and 6,160.2 (SD 1,653.0) steps per day, respectively. The mean number of minutes per day of sedentary, light, and moderate to vigorous activity for PwMS was 566.3 (SD 97.7), 167.4 (SD 94.0), and 7.6 (SD 12.4), respectively, and 551.9 (SD 92.4), 199.6 (SD 63.4), and 21.4 (SD 18.2), respectively, for caregivers. Interdependence between dyads for sedentary, light, moderate to vigorous activity, and step count was low and non-significant (rs=0.20, 0.26, 0.13, and -0.27, respectively; p>0.05). Conclusions: Although our findings do not support the interdependence of PA between caregivers and care recipients with MS, they do show that both partners are not engaging in sufficient PA to achieve important health benefits. These findings are important because they indicate that the dyads are likely to benefit from interventions for changing PA behavior.","Article","10.3138/PTC.2017-36.EP","WOS:000451853800014","WoS"

Determining threshold frequency of a flickering light (critical flicker fusion, CFF) allows early detection of visual impairment due to demyelination, and thus might play a role in substantiating the suspicion of an incipient ON, enabling early treatment-modification. Aim and objectives: The aim of this study is to correlate CFF thresholds with visual acuity/contrast sensitivity in a population of MS patients with and without ON. Furthermore, CFF will be correlated to loss of retinal neurons, as quantified by inner retinal layer thickness using optical coherence tomography (OCT). Methods: In this pilot study, 114 patients with MS and with prior optic neuritis (MS+ON; n=40) or without prior optic neuritis (MS-ON; n=74) and 89 controls (N) were tested in the Multilple Sclerosis Clinic of Aalborg University Hospital, Denmark, using several smartphone visual function tests (Landolt C acuity, Landolt C contrast sensitivity, and CFF). Testing was performed with the patient wearing their glasses at a distance of 0.4 meters. The results were analyzed utilising Kruskal Wallis test with pairwise multiple comparisons using Dunn's method. Results: Each smartphone test took approximately 15 seconds to complete and was intuitive enough that patients were able to immediately perform the task. Findings showed that CFF threshold values were significantly reduced in MS patients with or without previous ON compared to controls. As the only visual test, CFF showed no significant difference between MS-ON and MS+ON. Statistical Comparison of Smartphone Visual Function Tests in (Table Presented) Conclusion: Critical flicker fusion, a test of visual speed of conduction, provided some of the greatest discrimination between eyes of MS patients with or without a previous diagnosis of ON compared to normal eyes. This finding motivates the importance of using a behavioral visual test of visual conduction speed, such as critical flicker fusion, which is resistant to optical blur, to monitor various causes of visual dysfunction including MS.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458518798582","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458518798582&atitle=Critical+flicker+fusion+threshold+test+in+MS+population-is+it+a+viable+way+of+effective+and+quick+monitoring+of+visual+function%3F&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=24&issue=2&spage=166&epage=167&aulast=Zarei&aufirst=K.&auinit=K.&aufull=Zarei+K.&coden=&isbn=&pages=166-167&date=2018&auinit1=K&auinitm=","Embase"

The present study determines in detail whether disease-related physical, cognitive or psychosocial impairments contribute to the reporting rate of subjective self-report travel diaries and objective GPS tracking devices, besides socio-demographic and trip-related characteristics. The reporting rate of both data collection methods was analyzed in 108 persons with Multiple Sclerosis with various disability severities during a seven-day data collection period. The results demonstrated that there was only limited influence of disease-related dysfunctions on the reporting rate of both data collection methods, as well as only limited significant differences between subgroups with various disability severity. Overall, the data quality of the diary was higher than the quality of the GPS data: 66% of the trips were reported in both data collection methods, while overall more than one fifth of all trips were forgotten and not registered by GPS, and 11% were forgotten and not reported in the diary. Self-report travel diaries seemed to be more suitable for persons with a higher disability severity, as these persons more often forgot to take their GPS device with them when making a trip because of several organiza-tional issues related to their mobility limitations.","Article","10.1177/0361198118772952","WOS:000469284000062","WoS"

Although currently available interventions have had limited success in relieving MS-related fatigue, clinically significant reductions in perceived fatigue severity have been reported in a multimodal intervention pilot study that included a Paleolithic diet in addition to stress reduction, exercise, and electrical muscle stimulation. An optimal dietary approach to reducing MS-related fatigue has not been identified. To establish the specific effects of diet on MS symptoms, this study focuses on diet only instead of the previously tested multimodal intervention by comparing the effectiveness of two dietary patterns for the treatment of MS-related fatigue. The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of a modified Paleolithic and low saturated fat diet on perceived fatigue (primary outcome), cognitive and motor symptoms, and quality of life in persons with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Methods/design: This 36-week randomized clinical trial consists of three 12-week periods during which assessments of perceived fatigue, quality of life, motor and cognitive function, physical activity and sleep, diet quality, and social support for eating will be collected. The three 12-week periods will consist of the following: 1. Observation: Participants continue eating their usual diet. Discussion: Because fatigue is one of the most common and disabling symptoms of MS, effective management and reduction of MS-related fatigue has the potential to increase quality of life in this population. The results of this study will add to the evidence base for providing dietary recommendations to treat MS-related fatigue and other symptoms associated with this disease.","Article","10.1186/S13063-018-2680-X","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=17456215&id=doi:10.1186%2Fs13063-018-2680-x&atitle=Dietary+approaches+to+treat+MS-related+fatigue%3A+Comparing+the+modified+Paleolithic+%28Wahls+Elimination%29+and+low+saturated+fat+%28Swank%29+diets+on+perceived+fatigue+in+persons+with+relapsing-remitting+multiple+sclerosis%3A+Study+protocol+for+a+randomized+controlled+trial&stitle=Trials&title=Trials&volume=19&issue=1&spage=&epage=&aulast=Wahls&aufirst=Terry&auinit=T.&aufull=Wahls+T.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2018&auinit1=T&auinitm=","Embase"

Objective: Determine the role of dietary patterns on the early course of MS in Israeli MS patients. Methods: Relapsing remitting MS patients with disease duration up to 5 years completed a socio demographic questionnaire related to medical, lifestyle, and nutritional aspects, and a 3-day food diary recording all real-life meals and drinks with exact components and weights using their smartphones. Nutrients intake from all food diaries were analyzed based on dedicated software and disease progression variables, e.g. annual relapse rate and neurologic disability by the expanded disability status scale (EDSS) score were assessed during 1 year of follow-up. To define major dietary patterns, we used factor analysis. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between dietary patterns and progression of MS. Associations between food components intake and dietary supplements and disease progression variables were analyzed by SPSS. Results: 47 consecutive relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) patients, mean age 33 years, disease duration of 3.6 years, neurological disability by the EDSS score of 1.4, participated in the study. 80% were treated with immunomodulatory drugs. Mediterranean-like dietary pattern consisting of foods such as fruits and fish and rich in nutrients including fibers, beta-carotene, magnesium and potassium was inversely related to relapse activity (OR = 0.4; 95% CI: 0.19-0.87; p = 0.021). We found a significant difference in the Mediterranean-like dietary pattern factor score between patients who had no relapses compared to patients who had 1 or more relapses during one year of follow up [Mean difference (Md) = 0.61; 95% CI: 0.06-1.16; p = 0.03].

This type of monitoring estimates multiple activity parameters, including step count per epoch (daily or per minute). Passive ambulatory monitoring has good face validity and ample validation against research grade accelerometers. This measure is an exploratory endpoint of the pivotal SPI2 study, a randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial investigating the efficacy and safety of MD1003 (high dose Pharmaceutical grade Biotin) in patients (pts) with nonactive primary and secondary progressive MS (PPMS, SPMS). Objective: To assess the feasibility and validity of remote activity monitoring as a measure of ambulatory disability in patients from the SPI2 study. Methods: Remote monitoring of ambulatory activity in pts with PPMS/SPMS receiving either MD1003 300 mg/day or placebo will be collected using a Fitbit FlexR device between month (M) 0 and M15, and between M0 and M27 in the extension phase. The key variable will be the average daily step count (STEPS) over 1 week, recorded continuously in the natural environment as part of routine daily activity. Pts were trained by the investigational team on the setup, use, and maintenance of the device and asked to wear it as much as possible during the study. The daily goal on the device was initially set low to minimize the impact of motivation on ambulatory activity. Results: As of December 2017, 67 active centres (USA: 34; Europe: 26; Canada: 7) had enrolled 242 pts, of which 188 had full STEPS data. In these 188 pts, median expanded disability status scale (EDSS) was 6.0 (interquartile range [IQR]: 5.0-6.5), 51.1% were female, 35.6% had PPMS, 64.4% had SPMS, and median disease duration (IQR) was 13 (7.0-18.0) years.

Web-based interventions are increasingly being used to deliver targeted exercise programs and promote physical activity. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to systematically review current evidence regarding the effectiveness and user experience of web-based interventions in increasing physical activity in people with MS. Data Sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, PEDro, PsychInfo, Web of Sciences, The Cochrane Library, and gray literature were searched from 1990 to September 2016. Study Selection: English language articles reporting the use of web-based interventions to increase physical activity in adults with MS were included. Eligible quantitative studies were of any design and reported a measure of physical activity. Qualitative studies exploring users' experiences in any context were included. Of the 881 articles identified, 9 met the inclusion criteria. Data Extraction: Two reviewers independently assessed methodological quality and extracted data using standardized critical appraisal and data extraction tools from the Joanna Briggs Institute Meta Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-MAStARI). Data Synthesis: Meta-analysis of self-reported physical activity questionnaire data from 4 studies demonstrated a standardized mean difference of 0.67 (95% CI = 0.43-0.92), indicating a positive effect in favor of the web-based interventions. Narrative review of accelerometry data from 3 studies indicated increases in objectively measured physical activity. No qualitative studies met the inclusion criteria.

Methods: A multi-phase electronic application development process was conducted. A literature review for the characterisation of comfort in literature, a concept analysis study, and a qualitative study about PC patients' experiences of comfort were conducted (content validity). The Portuguese version of the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (α=.74) and the Spiritual End of Life Portuguese Comfort Questionnaire (α =.84) were used. The construct validity was discussed by 5 experts in PC (Kappa coefficient=.76). The app was designed using a web-based domain. Participants were purposely recruited from 2 hospitals with PC home visits (pre-test). Eligibility criteria included: age over 18 years, be followed by a PC team at home, have a computer device with internet access. Outcomes included: number of SOS messages, loading time, patient's opinion regarding ease of use, and usefulness. The project was approved by the ethics committee. Descriptive statistics were calculated (SPSS®) and specific data analysis methods were used, according to each phase. Results: A web-based app compatible with Android, iOS and Windows was designed. Holistic comfort includes symptom management and spiritual comfort. The app assesses 11 items (pain, tiredness, drowsiness, nausea, lack of appetite, shortness of breath, depression, anxiety, fear of the future, peace and the will to live).

In these clinical conditions the underlying neuroinflammatory processes are significantly heterogeneous. Nevertheless, a common link is the chronic activation of innate immune responses and imbalanced secretion of pro and anti-inflammatory mediators. In light of this, the discovery of robust biomarkers is crucial for screening, early diagnosis, and monitoring of neurological diseases. However, the difficulty to investigate biochemical processes directly in the central nervous system (CNS) is challenging. In recent years, biomarkers of CNS inflammatory responses have been identified in different body fluids, such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and tears. In addition, progress in micro and nanotechnology has enabled the development of biosensing platforms capable of detecting in real-time, multiple biomarkers in clinically relevant samples. Biosensing technologies are approaching maturity where they will become deployed in community settings, at which point screening programs and personalized medicine will become a reality.

Methods: Cortical somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) were recorded in mice via wearable, flexible epidermal electrode arrays. We then utilized the sensors to explore the effects of transcranial focused ultrasound, which non-invasively induced neural perturbation. SSEPs recorded with flexible epidermal sensors were quantified and bench-marked against those recorded with invasive epidural electrodes. Results: We found that cortical SSEPs recorded by flexible epidermal sensors were stimulus frequency dependent. Immediately following controlled, focal ultrasound perturbation, the sensors detected significant SSEP modulation, which consisted of dynamic amplitude decreases and altered stimulus-frequency dependence. These modifications were also dependent on the ultrasound perturbation dosage. The effects were consistent with those recorded with invasive electrodes, albeit with roughly one order of magnitude lower signal-to-noise ratio. Conclusion: We found that flexible epidermal sensors reported multiple SSEP parameters that were sensitive to focused ultrasound. This work therefore 1) establishes that epidermal electrodes are appropriate for monitoring the integrity of major CNS functionalities through SSEP; and 2) lever-aged this technology to explore ultrasound-induced neuromodulation. The sensor technology is well suited for this application because the sensor electrical properties are uninfluenced by direct exposure to ultrasound irradiation. Significance: The sensors and experimental paradigm we present involve standard, safe clinical neurological assessment methods and are thus applicable to a wide range of future translational studies in humans with any manner of health condition.","Article","10.1109/TBME.2017.2713647","WOS:000432982200010","WoS"

Enhancing physical activity might promote neuroregeneration in MS and positively influence disability. Previous studies indicate that evidence based patient information (EBPI) may assist greatly in inducing behavioural change. Objectives: To investigate the value and feasibility of a smartphone app providing EBPI about the benefit of physical activity in MS and an activity feedback to enhance physical activity in PPMS in a randomized waiting group controlled trial over 3 months. Methods: 39 patients with PPMS (mean age: 51 y, mean disease duration: 17 y, 54% female, mean EDSS: 4,0) were 1:1 randomized into either a control group (n=20; receiving an information leaflet promoting physical activity for better health and a smartphone without access to the app) or an intervention group (n=18; receiving a smartphone with password to unlock app). The intervention group was granted access to individual activity feedback and a “wiki-based” multimedia app as an EBPI, including short films and results of latest PPMS therapy research. Assessments included one week of real life activity monitoring by Actigraph, clinical performance tests (e.g. timed 25 foot walk) and patient reported outcome measures (PROMS) on physical ability and activity and were collected at baseline and after three months. The primary endpoint was defined as met with an 20% increase of mean steps per day or an 20% increase of mean physical activity per day (minutes spent in MVPA, Actigraph). Secondary endpoints included improvement of other Actigraph activity measures, clinical performance tests and PROMS. Results: The 20 % increase of number of steps or physical activity as primary endpoint was not reached (intervention group: 4 out of 16, control 5 out of 12, p-value: 0.6). Neither did the intervention improve secondary outcomes including real life mobility, clinical performance and PROMS. However, the intervention group had a tendency towards a stable respectively faster T25FW (-0.34 s) while we observed a worsened T25FWT in the control group (+4.4 s, p-value: 0.19). Conclusions: This small RCT proofs feasibility of a smartphone app as a technical framework for health care interventions. However, providing information alone seems insufficient to induce behavioural change. Future studies need longer intervention duration and more interactive cognitive behavioural coaching strategies.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458518798591","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458518798591&atitle=Evidence+based+patient+information+and+smartphone+based+activity+feedback+does+not+enhance+physical+activity+in+PPMS+in+a+randomized+controlled+trial+over+three+months&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=24&issue=2&spage=733&epage=&aulast=Nasseri&aufirst=N.N.&auinit=N.N.&aufull=Nasseri+N.N.&coden=&isbn=&pages=733-&date=2018&auinit1=N&auinitm=N","Embase"

Evidence suggests that physical activity (PA) helps people with MS reduce fatigue and improve quality of life. The use of mobile technologies for health has grown in recent years with little involvement from relevant stakeholders. User-centered design (UCD) is a design philosophy with the goal of creating solutions specific to the needs and tasks of the intended users. UCD involves stakeholders early and often in the design process. In a preliminary study, we assessed the landscape of commercially available MS mobile health (mHealth) apps; to our knowledge, no study has explored what persons with MS and their formal care providers think of mHealth solutions for PA. Objective: The aim of this study was to (1) explore MS-specific needs for MS mHealth solutions for PA, (2) detect perceived obstacles and facilitators for mHealth solutions from persons with MS and health care professionals, and (3) understand the motivational aspects behind adoption of mHealth solutions for MS. Methods: A mixed-methods design study was conducted in Kliniken Valens, Switzerland, a clinic specializing in neurological rehabilitation. We explored persons with MS and health care professionals who work with them separately. The study had a qualitative part comprising focus groups and interviews, and a quantitative part with standardized tools such as satisfaction with life scale and electronic health (eHealth) literacy. Results: A total of 12 persons with relapsing-remitting MS and 12 health care professionals from different backgrounds participated in the study. Participants were well-educated with an even distribution between genders. Themes identified during analysis were MS-related barriers and facilitators, mHealth design considerations, and general motivational aspects. The insights generated were used to create MS personas for design purposes. Desired mHealth features were as follows: (1) activity tracking, (2) incentives for completing tasks and objectives, (3) customizable goal setting, (4) optional sociability, and (5) game-like attitude among others. Potential barriers to mHealth apps adoption were as follows: (1) rough on-boarding experiences, (2) lack of clear use benefits, and (3) disruption of the health care provider-patient relationship. Potential facilitators were identified: (1) endorsements from experts, (2) playfulness, and (3) tailored to specific persons with MS needs. A total of 4 MS personas were developed to provide designers and computer scientists means to help in the creation of future mHealth solutions for MS. Conclusions: mHealth solutions for increasing PA in persons with MS hold promise. Allowing for realistic goal setting and positive feedback, while minimizing usability burdens, seems to be critical for the adoption of such apps. Fatigue management is especially important in this population; more attention should be brought to this area.","Article","10.2196/MHEALTH.8996","WOS:000426415800006","WoS"

This study aimed to investigate user confidence and satisfaction in using smart technology for selfmanagement of symptoms associated with multiple sclerosis (MS). Specifically, to determine if demographic and disease variables were predictive of baseline confidence and satisfaction in smart technology use. Method: This study involved eight community-dwelling adults with MS about to embark on a 4-week programme focused on self-management of cognitive and mood problems, and fatigue delivered by an occupational therapist. Participants completed a newly developed questionnaire, the Smart Technology Satisfaction and Confidence Scale (STSCS) at baseline to examine perceptions of satisfaction and confidence in using smart technology. Linear regressions were used to determine the predictive value of demographic and disease characteristics. Results: Age, marital status, living situation, education, work status and disease severity were significantly related to baseline confidence and satisfaction ratings on the STSCS. Conclusions: Smartwatches present a novel platform for assisting with selfmanagement of disabling symptoms for people living in the community. Exposure to the latest smart technology may improve user confidence. Training in its application should be tailored based on user demographics, disease severity, baseline confidence and aspects of usability.","Conference Abstract","10.1017/BRIMP.2018.14","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=18395252&id=doi:10.1017%2FBrImp.2018.14&atitle=Factors+influencing+the+use+of+smartwatch+technology+for+symptom+self-management&stitle=Brain+Impairment&title=Brain+Impairment&volume=19&issue=3&spage=284&epage=&aulast=Gullo&aufirst=Hannah&auinit=H.&aufull=Gullo+H.&coden=&isbn=&pages=284-&date=2018&auinit1=H&auinitm=","Embase"

Motor related fatigue is usually assessed using the 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT) and measuring the decline in distance walked from minute 1 to 6 [2]. Although widely used, this test does not provide objective information, other than speed, about fatigue-related deterioration of gait. For this purpose, optoelectronic kinematic analysis has been applied with good results [1]. However, inertial measurement units (IMUs) seem a promising alternative to obtain quantitative information directly in clinical settings, with lower costs and easier procedures. Aim of this study was a pilot analysis of fatigue-related walking decline in PwMS during the 6MWT instrumented with 3 IMUs. Methods: 9 healthy subjects (HS, age: 35±11 years) and 15 PwMS (age: 51±13 years) performed the 6MWT wearing 3 IMUs (MTw, Xsens, NL) on ankles and posterior lower trunk (L4–L5 level). The test was conducted in a 30-meter corridor with the instruction “Walk as fast as you can”. After each minute, the examiner recorded the meters walked by the subject, who was asked to rate his perceived fatigue at lower limbs on the Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion scale (RPE_LL). After elimination of the turning portions of accelerometer and gyroscope signals (f(sampling)=75Hz), the following features were computed for each minute. Heel-strike and foot-off were detected following [3] to compute stride duration and its coefficient of variation CV(Tstride)=100*(IQR(Tstride)/Median(Tstride)). Step symmetry [4] and harmonic ratio (HR) [5] were calculated for antero-posterior (AP) medio-lateral (ML) and vertical (V) trunk accelerations. Repeated measure ANOVA (between-group factor: HS, PwMS; within-group factor: minute 1 to 6) was used. The features showing a significant (p<0.05) TimexGroup interaction (i.e. different behaviour across minutes in the 2 groups) were correlated to RPE_LL. Spearman r(s) was used for speed and partial r(s) (pr(s)) was used for instrumental parameters to correct for speed. Results: RPE_LL increased in both groups, with a statistically significant interaction effect (p<0.05) showing a greater increase of fatigue from minute 3 to 6 in PwMS (+27%) compared to HS (+9%). Both groups showed a similar progressive decrease of velocity from minute 1 to 6 (p<0.001) (HS: −8%, PwMS: - 12%). Statistically significant interaction effect (p<0.05) was found for CV(Tstride), ML step symmetry and ML HR, indicating almost constant values across minutes in HS and a progressive alteration in PwMS from minute 1 to 6 (CV(Tstride): +38%, ML step symmetry: −23%, ML HR: −16%). Significant correlations with RPE_LL were found for walking speed (r(s)=−0.41, p<0.001), ML step symmetry (pr(s)=−0.31, p<0.01) and ML HR (pr(s)=−0.26, p<0.05). No correlation was found for CV(Tstride) (pr(s)=−0.05; n.s.). Discussion: As expected, present results showed a higher level of perceived lower limb exertion in PwMS during the 6MWT. While clinical 6MWT score (i.e. speed) showed a similar decrease of velocity in both HS and PwMS, instrumental features revealed different behaviour of the two groups. In particular, HS maintained an almost unaltered gait pattern during the test, while PwMS showed a progressive decrease of stride regularity (CV(Tstride)), ML step symmetry and ML gait smoothness (ML HR). Importantly, the last two features significantly correlated with RPE_LL, even after correcting for gait speed. This indicated that ML step symmetry and ML HR capture distinct information compared to clinical 6MWT score. This can be used as additional objective measures of fatigue-related gait deterioration. Interestingly, the above results were found in ML parameters only, suggesting that alterations of ML movements are the most involved in lower limb fatigue. A greater sample should be analyzed in future studies to confirm present findings.","Conference Abstract","10.1016/J.GAITPOST.2018.07.113","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=18792219&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.gaitpost.2018.07.113&atitle=Fatigue-induced+alterations+of+gait+in+Multiple+Sclerosis+through+an+instrumented+6-Minute+Walk+Test%3A+A+pilot+study&stitle=Gait+Posture&title=Gait+and+Posture&volume=66&issue=&spage=S8&epage=S9&aulast=Carpinella&aufirst=I.&auinit=I.&aufull=Carpinella+I.&coden=&isbn=&pages=S8-S9&date=2018&auinit1=I&auinitm=","Embase"

The aim of this study was to characterise gait in both laboratory and daily life conditions for a group of patients with moderate to severe ambulatory impairment due to MS. To this purpose, algorithms to detect and characterise gait from wearable inertial sensors data were also validated. Methods Fourteen patients with MS were divided into two groups according to their disability level (EDSS 6.5–6.0 and EDSS 5.5–5.0, respectively). They performed both intermittent and continuous walking bouts (WBs) in a gait laboratory wearing waist and shank mounted inertial sensors. An algorithm (W-CWT) to estimate gait events and temporal parameters (mean and variability values) using data recorded from the waist mounted sensor (Dynaport, Mc Roberts) was tested against a reference algorithm (S-REF) based on the shank-worn sensors (OPAL, APDM). Subsequently, the accuracy of another algorithm (W-PAM) to detect and classify WBs was also tested. The validated algorithms were then used to quantify gait characteristics during short (sWB, 5–50 steps), intermediate (iWB, 51–100 steps) and long (lWB, >100 steps) daily living WBs and laboratory walking. Group means were compared using a two-way ANOVA. Results W-CWT compared to S-REF showed good gait event accuracy (0.05–0.10 s absolute error) and was not influenced by disability level. It slightly overestimated stride time in intermittent walking (0.012 s) and overestimated highly variability of temporal parameters in both intermittent (17.5%–58.2%) and continuous walking (11.2%–76.7%). The accuracy of W-PAM was speed-dependent and decreased with increasing disability. The ANOVA analysis showed that patients walked at a slower pace in daily living than in the laboratory. In daily living gait, all mean temporal parameters decreased as the WB duration increased. In the sWB, the patients with a lower disability score showed, on average, lower values of the temporal parameters. Variability decreased as the WB duration increased. Conclusions This study validated a method to quantify walking in real life in people with MS and showed how gait characteristics estimated from short walking bouts during daily living may be the most informative to quantify level of disability and effects of interventions in patients moderately affected by MS. The study provides a robust approach for the quantification of recog-nised clinically relevant outcomes and an innovative perspective in the study of real life walking.","Article","10.1371/JOURNAL.PONE.0196463","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=19326203&id=doi:10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0196463&atitle=Free-living+and+laboratory+gait+characteristics+in+patients+with+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=PLoS+ONE&title=PLoS+ONE&volume=13&issue=5&spage=&epage=&aulast=Storm&aufirst=Fabio+A.&auinit=F.A.&aufull=Storm+F.A.&coden=POLNC&isbn=&pages=-&date=2018&auinit1=F&auinitm=A","Embase"

The objectives of this study were to advance the literature on the utility of free-living physical activity tracking from secondary analyses of a pilot study in MS patients. Method: The original observational study was conducted in participants with MS at PatientsLikeMe (www.PatientsLikeMe.com), an online network of patients with chronic diseases. Participants completed a baseline self-assessment, and received a Fitbit One(TM) wearable device with instructions to upload data. Eligible participants (1) self-reported MS, (2) logged on to the PatientsLikeMe website 90 days prior to enrollment, and (3) consented to participate electronically. Participants (1) < 18 years, (2) living outside the United States, and (3) requiring wheelchair assistance for most daily activities were excluded. The secondary analyses were limited to participants with complete data on MS type, disease duration, and Multiple Sclerosis Rating Scale (MSRS) and at least 7 days of wearable data. Step count was used as a measure of physical activity. Results: The analysis cohort of 114 participants uploaded a mean of 20.1 days of wearable data over the 23-day study (87% adherence); participants averaged 4,393 steps per day. The mean age of participants was 52 years, predominantly female (75%), relapsing-remitting type (79%), with mean disease duration of 16 years. Mean MSRS score within 30-day of baseline was 32; 72% reported mild-moderate walking disability. The reliability of step count measured by intraclass correlation was 0.55 for a single day, ≥0.7 for 2-day average, and ≥0.9 for 7-day average. After controlling for covariates, self-reported disease severity (MSRS quartile) was an independent predictor of step count (p < 0.001). Least square means (LS means) for participants that were least disabled (lowest quartile) was 5,937 steps, which was significantly higher than participants in the second, third, and fourth quartiles (4,570, 3,490, and 3,272, respectively). Similarly, LS means of participants with no ambulatory disability (measured by MSRS walk component) was 6,931 steps, significantly higher than participants with greater disability (4,743, 4,394, 2,727 steps for symptomatic, mild, and moderate disability, respectively, p < 0.001). Discussion: Using an interactive platform, this study captured free-living mobility data in MS patients. Important metrics such as the use of a minimum of 2-day estimates and self-reported disability were found to be robust indicators and correlates, respectively, of participant activity levels. Further triangulation of such metrics may reduce the burden on patients, clinicians, and researchers when monitoring clinical status.","Article","10.1159/000488040","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=2504110X&id=doi:10.1159%2F000488040&atitle=Free-living+physical+activity+monitoring+in+Adult+US+Patients+with+multiple+sclerosis+using+a+consumer+wearable+device&stitle=Digit.+Biomarkers&title=Digital+Biomarkers&volume=2&issue=1&spage=47&epage=63&aulast=Dasmahapatra&aufirst=Pronabesh&auinit=P.&aufull=Dasmahapatra+P.&coden=&isbn=&pages=47-63&date=2018&auinit1=P&auinitm=","Embase"

METHODS: A total of eight functional tests were conducted and physical activity was objectively measured (Actigraph GT3X accelerometer) for one week in 34 people with multiple sclerosis. A corrected Akaike Information Criterion analysis was performed to identify the strongest correlates with moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, total activity and sedentary time. RESULTS: The multiple regression analysis converged on a model for moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (R2 = 0.31, F = 6.97, p= 0.003) that included total strength of the less-affected leg (partial r = 0.46, p = 0.007) and average peg test performance (partial r = -0.30, p = 0.087). The model for total activity (R2 = 0.40, F = 10.51, p < 0.001) included five times sit-to-stand performance (partial r= -0.44, p = 0.010) and total strength of the less-affected leg (partial r = 0.31, p = 0.077). The model for sedentary time (R2=0.22, F = 9.23, p = 0.005) only included total strength of the more affected leg (r= -0.47, p = 0.005). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that leg strength, manual dexterity and the ability to perform functional tasks may be important correlates with physical activity levels in people with multiple sclerosis. The findings of this pilot study can inform future investigations aiming to increase physical activity levels or develop improved rehabilitation protocols for people with multiple sclerosis. Implications for Rehabilitation Physical activity is an effective means of improving the symptoms associated with multiple sclerosis. Participation in physical activity by people with multiple sclerosis may be affected by functional factors such as leg strength, manual dexterity and the ability to rise from a seated position. Bilateral leg strength differences should be assessed and addressed in people with multiple sclerosis.","Article","10.1080/09638288.2017.1336647","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14645165&id=doi:10.1080%2F09638288.2017.1336647&atitle=Functional+factors+that+are+important+correlates+to+physical+activity+in+people+with+multiple+sclerosis%3A+a+pilot+study&stitle=Disabil+Rehabil&title=Disability+and+rehabilitation&volume=40&issue=20&spage=2416&epage=2423&aulast=Ketelhut&aufirst=Nathaniel+B.&auinit=N.B.&aufull=Ketelhut+N.B.&coden=&isbn=&pages=2416-2423&date=2018&auinit1=N&auinitm=B","Embase"

In this article, we take a step further in gait analysis and provide a methodology for predicting the movements of the legs, which can be applied in prosthesis to imitate the missing part of the leg in walking. In particular, we propose a method, called GaIn, to control non-invasive, robotic, prosthetic legs. GaIn can infer the movements of both missing shanks and feet for humans suffering from double trans-femoral amputation using biologically inspired recurrent neural networks. Predictions are performed for casual walking related activities such as walking, taking stairs, and running based on thigh movement. In our experimental tests, GaIn achieved a 4.55 degrees prediction error for shank movements on average. However, a patient's intention to stand up and sit down cannot be inferred from thigh movements. In fact, intention causes thigh movements while the shanks and feet remain roughly still. The GaIn system can be triggered by thigh muscle activities measured with electromyography (EMG) sensors to make robotic prosthetic legs perform standing up and sitting down actions. The GaIn system has low prediction latency and is fast and computationally inexpensive to be deployed on mobile platforms and portable devices.","Article","10.3390/S18124146","WOS:000454817100065","WoS"

These estimations require knowledge of 3D forces and moments (F&#x0026;M), and accurate foot positions. Though an existing Ambulatory Gait and Balance System (AGBS) consisting of 3D F&#x0026;M sensors, and inertial measurement units (IMUs) can be used for the purpose, it is bulky and conspicuous. Resistive pressure sensors were investigated as an alternative to the onboard 3D F&#x0026;M sensors. Subject specific regression models were built to estimate 3D F&#x0026;M from 1D plantar pressures. The model was applicable for different walking speeds. Different pressure sensor configurations were studied to optimise system complexity and accuracy. Using resistive sensors only under the toe and heel, we were able to estimate the XCoM with a mean absolute RMS error of 2.2&#x00B1;0.3 cm in the walking direction while walking at a preferred speed, when compared to the AGBS. For the same case, the XCoM was classified as ahead or behind the Base of Support correctly at 97.7 &#x00B1; 1.7%. In conclusion, the study shows that pressure sensors, minimally under the heel and toe, offer a lightweight and inconspicuous alternative for F&#x0026;M sensing, towards estimating ambulatory gait and dynamic balance.","Article in Press","10.1109/TNSRE.2018.2885309","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=15344320&id=doi:10.1109%2FTNSRE.2018.2885309&atitle=Gait+and+Dynamic+Balance+Sensing+Using+Wearable+Foot+Sensors&stitle=IEEE+Trans.+Neural+Syst.+Rehabil.+Eng.&title=IEEE+Transactions+on+Neural+Systems+and+Rehabilitation+Engineering&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Refai&aufirst=Mohamed+Irfan+Mohamed&auinit=M.I.M.&aufull=Refai+M.I.M.&coden=ITNSB&isbn=&pages=-&date=2018&auinit1=M&auinitm=I.M.","Embase"

We hypothesized that aggregating data from two simple smartphone tests of fine finger movements with differing contribution of specific neurological domains (i.e., strength & cerebellar functions, vision, and reaction time) will allow establishment of secondary outcomes that reflect domain-specific deficit. This hypothesis was tested by assessing correlations of smartphone-derived outcomes with relevant parts of neurological examination in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. We developed MS test suite on Android platform, consisting of several simple functional tests. This paper compares cross-sectional and longitudinal performance of Finger tapping and Balloon popping tests by 76 MS patients and 19 healthy volunteers (HV). The primary outcomes of smartphone tests, the average number of taps (per two 10-s intervals) and the average number of pops (per two 26-s intervals) differentiated MS from HV with similar power to traditional, investigator-administered test of fine finger movements, 9-hole peg test (9HPT). Additionally, the secondary outcomes identified patients with predominant cerebellar dysfunction, motor fatigue and poor eye-hand coordination and/or reaction time, as evidenced by significant correlations between these derived outcomes and relevant parts of neurological examination. The intra-individual variance in longitudinal sampling was low. In the time necessary for performing 9HPT, smartphone tests provide much richer and reliable measurements of several distinct neurological functions. These data suggest that combing more creatively-construed smartphone apps may one day recreate the entire neurological examination.","Article","10.3389/FNEUR.2018.00740","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=16642295&id=doi:10.3389%2Ffneur.2018.00740&atitle=Identifying+and+quantifying+neurological+disability+via+smartphone&stitle=Front.+Neurol.&title=Frontiers+in+Neurology&volume=9&issue=SEP&spage=&epage=&aulast=Boukhvalova&aufirst=Alexandra+K.&auinit=A.K.&aufull=Boukhvalova+A.K.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2018&auinit1=A&auinitm=K","Embase"

In current fatigue management interventions, personalized, real-time follow-up is often lacking. The objective of the study is to assess the feasibility of the MS TeleCoach, a novel intervention offering telemonitoring of fatigue and telecoaching of physical activity and energy management in persons with MS (pwMS) over a 12-week period. The goal of the MS TeleCoach, conceived as a combination of monitoring, self-management and motivational messages, is to enhance levels of physical activity thereby improving fatigue in pwMS in an accessible and interactive way, reinforcing self-management of patients. Methods: We conducted a prospective, open-label feasibility study of the MS TeleCoach in pwMS with Expanded Disability Status Scale ≤ 4 and moderate to severe fatigue as measured by the Fatigue Scale for Motor and Cognitive Functions (FSMC). Following a 2-week run-in period to assess the baseline activity level per patient, the target number of activity counts was gradually increased over the 12-week period through telecoaching. The primary efficacy outcome was change in FSMC total score from baseline to study end. A subset of patients was asked to fill in D-QUEST 2.0, a usability questionnaire, to evaluate the satisfaction with the MS TeleCoach device and the experienced service. Results: Seventy-five patients were recruited from 16 centres in Belgium, of which 57 patients (76%) completed the study. FSMC total score (p = 0.009) and motor and cognitive subscores (p = 0.007 and p = 0.02 respectively) decreased from baseline to week 12, indicating an improvement in fatigue. One third of participants with severe fatigue changed to a lower FSMC category for both FSMC total score and subscores. The post-study evaluation of patient satisfaction showed that the intervention was well accepted and that patients were very satisfied with the quality of the professional services. Conclusion: Using MS TeleCoach as a self-management tool in pwMS suffering from mild disability and moderate to severe fatigue appeared to be feasible, both technically and from a content perspective. Its use was associated with improved fatigue levels in the participants who completed the study. The MS Telecoach seems to meet the need for a low-cost, accessible and interactive self-management tool in MS.","Article","10.1016/J.MSARD.2018.03.020","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=22110356&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.msard.2018.03.020&atitle=Improving+fatigue+in+multiple+sclerosis+by+smartphone-supported+energy+management%3A+The+MS+TeleCoach+feasibility+study&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+Relat.+Disord.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+and+Related+Disorders&volume=22&issue=&spage=90&epage=96&aulast=D%27hooghe&aufirst=Marie&auinit=M.&aufull=D%27hooghe+M.&coden=&isbn=&pages=90-96&date=2018&auinit1=M&auinitm=","Embase"

This task is usually assessed with clinical scales suffering from partial subjectivity and limited detail in evaluating different task aspects. In this paper, we instrumented the assessment of stair ascent in people with multiple sclerosis (MS), stroke (ST), and Parkinson's disease (PD) to analyze the validity of the proposed quantitative indexes and characterize subjects' performances. Participants climbed 10 steps wearing a magneto-inertial sensor [magneto-inertial measurement unit (MIMU)] at sternum level. Gait pattern features (step frequency, symmetry, regularity, and harmonic ratios), and upper trunk sway were computed from MIMU signals. Clinical modified dynamic gait index (mDGI) and mDGI-Item 8 'Up stairs' were administered. Significant correlations with clinical scores were found for gait pattern features (rs≥ 0.536) and trunk pitch sway (rs≤-0.367) demonstrating their validity. Instrumental indexes showed alterations in the three pathological groups compared to healthy subjects and significant differences, not clinically detected, among MS, ST, and PD. MS showed the worst performance, with alterations of all gait pattern aspects and larger trunk pitch sway. ST showed worsening in gait pattern features but not in trunk motion. PD showed fewer alterations consisting in reduced step frequency and trunk yaw sway. These results suggest that the use of an MIMU provided valid objective indexes revealing between-group differences in stair ascent not detected by clinical scales. Importantly, the indexes include upper trunk measures, usually not present in clinical tests, and provide relevant hints for tailored rehabilitation.","Article","10.1109/TNSRE.2018.2881324","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=15344320&id=doi:10.1109%2FTNSRE.2018.2881324&atitle=Instrumental+Assessment+of+Stair+Ascent+in+People+with+Multiple+Sclerosis%2C+Stroke%2C+and+Parkinson%27s+Disease%3A+A+Wearable-Sensor-Based+Approach&stitle=IEEE+Trans.+Neural+Syst.+Rehabil.+Eng.&title=IEEE+Transactions+on+Neural+Systems+and+Rehabilitation+Engineering&volume=26&issue=12&spage=2324&epage=2332&aulast=Carpinella&aufirst=Ilaria&auinit=I.&aufull=Carpinella+I.&coden=ITNSB&isbn=&pages=2324-2332&date=2018&auinit1=I&auinitm=","Embase"

It is known that physical activity is closely related to fatigue, but the relationship between fatigue and physical activity level is not clear in patients with MS. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between fatigue and physical activity level in patients with MS. (Clinical trials number: NCT03255460) Methods: Fourteen ambulatory patients with MS (age: 35.5±9.8 years, EDSS: 1, 03±0, 6) participated in the study. Fatigue was assessed using Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS). Level of physical activity was evaluated with accelerometer (ActiGraph GT3X+) during three consecutive days and performed the amount of physical activity expressed in counts per minute (CPM), and counts per day period (morning, afternoon, evening), duration of physical activity intensity categories (sedentary, light, moderate, vigorous). Results: The FSS was found to be negatively associated with the light activity (r=-0.538, p<0.05) and the number of steps (r=-0.695, p<0.001). The physical effect section of FIS was associated with daily CPM (r=-0.610, p<0.05), morning CPM (r=-0.681, p<0.05), sedentary activity (r=0.631, p<0.05), light activity (r=-0.548, p<0.05), and number of steps (r=-0.854, p<0.001). The psychosocial effect section of FIS was associated with daily CPM (r=-0.535, p<0.05), morning CPM (r=-0.541, p<0.05), sedentary activity (r=0.550, p<0.05), and number of steps (r=-0.803, p<0.001). Conclusion: These results show that severity of fatigue increases in MS. Fatigue reduced both physical activity level and participation. We thought that a reduction in physical activity level could cause secondary problems due to inactivity. Therefore, management strategy of fatigue should be taught to patients to increase their physical activity level.","Conference Abstract",NA,"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13008757&id=doi:&atitle=Investigation+of+the+relationship+between+fatigue+and+physical+activity+level+in+patients+with+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Fiz.+Rehab.&title=Fizyoterapi+Rehabilitasyon&volume=29&issue=2&spage=S23&epage=S24&aulast=%C3%87ekim&aufirst=Kader&auinit=K.&aufull=%C3%87ekim+K.&coden=&isbn=&pages=S23-S24&date=2018&auinit1=K&auinitm=","Embase"

The study included 30 PwMS, mean disease duration 11.8 (SD = 6.8) years, and 15 healthy controls. The investigation included a cognitive assessment; texting assessment based on 100 typed characters; and gait assessment under two different conditions: normal walking and walking while texting. Outcome measures included the Symbol Digit Modalities Test to assess cognition. Texting measures included accuracy (%) and duration(s). Gait was assessed with axial accelerometers to quantify temporal measures. The dual-task cost percentage for the walking tests and texting accuracy was determined by calculating the percentage change from a single task to a double task. The impact of texting while walking on gait measures was significantly higher in PwMS; furthermore, texting was less accurate compared to the healthy controls. The dual-task cost for texting accuracy in the PwMS group was 153.3 (SD = 105.7) compared to 8.9 (SD = 26.6) in the healthy group. A significant association was found solely in the PwMS group between cognition and texting accuracy while in a sitting position (R(2) = 0.564) and while walking (R(2) = 0.534).

Several studies pointed out correlation between selfreported activity and phone usage and self-reported mood. A further step is to use phone sensors data to depict a user's profile and check meaningful variations. To pursue this goal, a devoted Android app collecting social and motion features extracted from personal smartphone registers (Call Logs, Apps Usage -social e communication apps-, Screen Brightness, GPS and accelerometer) has been installed on the personal smartphone of 15 users for 1 month acquiring data 24hours/7days. Data are acquired in background without interfering with the normal phone usage and without requiring user intervention. Data are transmitted wireless to a remote server, processed every 24h to extract selected features saved anonymously in a database. Anomaly detection algorithms have been implemented to identify changes in the daily trend or unexpected events in data sets. Unlike standard classification tasks, anomaly detection is often applied to unlabelled data such as those at our disposal, considering only the internal structure of the data set. Results showed a good predisposition to the system and reliability in detecting smartphone use and the distribution of activity along the day.

Methods: Adults with MS aged between 21 and 60 years, willing to participate, and using any kind of smart devices completed an online survey. A self-explicated conjoint approach was adapted to elicit preferences and opinions of each individual. Participants were asked to rate different levels for different attributes pertaining to: (i) aspect of MS that could be monitored, and (ii) device options to monitor those aspects of MS. Preferences for each attribute were ranked by importance and part-worth utilities (i.e. preference score) for each attribute level of performance were generated, allowing for easy side-by-side comparison. Results: A total of 140 people with MS participated in the survey (France: 30, Germany: 30, US: 50, UK: 30). The part-worth utility/preference score was highest for Physical activity (0.1523), followed by brain/mental health (0.1472), and physical fatigue (0.1457) indicating that these were the most important areas of MS to monitor, while physical fatigue (0.0931) was the most important symptom to monitor. Monitoring results of medical tests (0.1054), medication intake and appointment monitoring (0.0864) are as important as monitoring physical activity (0.0923), physical fatigue (0.1021) and brain/mental health (0.0973). The preferred way of monitoring symptoms is generally to track activities that improve the symptoms and to track the time of day when symptoms are at their worst, which could help them manage their symptoms.

Fatigue is one of most common symptoms that persons with MS experience, having significant impact on their quality of life and limiting their activity levels. Self-management strategies are used to support them in the care of their health. Mobile health (mHealth) solutions are a way to offer persons with chronic conditions tools to successfully manage their symptoms and problems. Gamification is a current trend among mHealth apps used to create engaging user experiences and is suggested to be effective for behavioral change. To be effective, mHealth solutions need to be designed to specifically meet the intended audience needs. User-centered design (UCD) is a design philosophy that proposes placing end users' needs and characteristics in the center of design and development, involving users early in the different phases of the software life cycle. There is a current gap in mHealth apps for persons with MS, which presents an interesting area to explore. Objective: The purpose of this study was to describe the design and evaluation process of a gamified mHealth solution for behavioral change in persons with MS using UCD. Methods: Building on previous work of our team where we identified needs, barriers, and facilitators for mHealth apps for persons with MS, we followed UCD to design and evaluate a mobile app prototype aimed to help persons with MS self-manage their fatigue. Design decisions were evidence-driven and guided by behavioral change models (BCM). Usability was assessed through inspection methods using Nielsen's heuristic evaluation. Results: The mHealth solution More Stamina was designed. It is a task organization tool designed to help persons with MS manage their energy to minimize the impact of fatigue in their day-to-day life. The tool acts as a to-do list where users can input tasks in a simple manner and assign Stamina Credits, a representation of perceived effort, to the task to help energy management and energy profiling. The app also features personalization and positive feedback. The design process gave way to relevant lessons to the design of a gamified behavioral change mHealth app such as the importance of metaphors in concept design, negotiate requirements with the BCM constructs, and tailoring of gamified experiences among others. Several usability problems were discovered during heuristic evaluation and guided the iterative design of our solution. Conclusions: In this paper, we designed an app targeted for helping persons with MS in their fatigue management needs. We illustrate how UCD can help in designing mHealth apps and the benefits and challenges that designers might face when using this approach. This paper provides insight into the design process of gamified behavioral change mHealth apps and the negotiation process implied in it.","Article","10.2196/MHEALTH.9437","WOS:000426497400002","WoS"

Background: Tremor is the most frequently described movement disorder in MS (from 25% to 58%1 depending on the series) and can be medically refractory and highly disabling. Both thalamic deep brain stimulation and radiofrequency thalamotomy have shown to provide sustained benefit in selected patients2. The recent development of MRIgFUS allows performing ablations in deep brain structures through an incisionless approach, reducing the risks related to surgery. This could be of special importance in already damaged brains, such as those ofMS patients. Methods: A 28-year-old female diagnosed with MS was selected for MRIgFUS VIM thalamotomy to treat right upper limb tremor refractory to medical treatment and highly disabling. Assessment was performed both at baseline and 3 months after treatment through the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin scale (FTMscale), as well as with EMG and accelerometer recordings. Results: Abolition of tremor was achieved intraprocedure after initial therapeutic sonications. The benefit was sustained by three months, with a 81.8% of improvement in the score of the FTM scale for the treated hand (FTM part A= 11 at baseline vs 2 at 3 months). Accelerometer and EMG tremor recording supported the clinical improvement. After treatment, the patient was able to use her hand normally. Mild-to-moderate dysarthria occurred after procedure, but it had practically resolved by 3 months. Conclusions: This is, to our knowledge, the first report of a MS associated-tremor successfully treated with MRIgFUS thalamotomy. This poses a potentially new therapeutic option for MS patients suffering of tremor refractory to medical treatment.","Conference Abstract",NA,"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=15318257&id=doi:&atitle=MRI-guided+Focused+Ultrasound+thalamotomy+for+Multiple+Sclerosisassociated+tremor%3A+A+case+report&stitle=Mov.+Disord.&title=Movement+Disorders&volume=33&issue=&spage=S231&epage=S232&aulast=Fern%C3%A1ndez-Rodr%C3%ADguez&aufirst=B.&auinit=B.&aufull=Fern%C3%A1ndez-Rodr%C3%ADguez+B.&coden=&isbn=&pages=S231-S232&date=2018&auinit1=B&auinitm=","Embase"

People with MS (PwMS) live with a chronic illness, which, throughout their lives, require them to be aware of the state of their health as well as being in continuous contact with the healthcare system. Studies indicate, that the course of illness can be affected by environmental factors and life-style, however, there is currently no research into how wearables may be a tool for PwMS to act upon developments in their illness. Wearables also have the potential to be implemented as patient-reported information in a clinical context and could be a part of targeted treatment for PwMS. Objective: The aim of this project is to investigate how the daily lives of MS patients may benefit from the development in healthtechnology and whether wearables can be useful in a clinical context. Methods: The project focuses on three aspects; 1) the perspective of the patients in regards to their everyday lives with MS, 2) the perspective of the healthcare professional and what is meaningful data to bring into the clinical context, and 3) the validity and research potential of different types of wearables. Each aspect is investigated qualitatively (focus group interviews and individual interviews). The project also includes a trial period where MS patients are equipped with a wearable for two months, with the objective of learning whether the use of wearables is of value to the individual, whether the output can be used in health care consultations, and finally to assess the validity and research potential of different wearables.

Background: MS, a disease characterized by relapses/progression, commonly impacts ambulation. Impaired PwMS ambulation causes disability. Current approaches documenting gait disease impact/progression including EDSS/T25FW are insufficiently sensitive to identify/quantify/document critical subtle granular objective impact/progression. This information might improve disease modifying therapy choice (e.g. efficacy, timing of change). Objective analyses approaches have included digital devices of varying types utilizing different transducers (e.g. foot pressure, accelerometer). Comparing different technologies in PwMS with varying disability levels is important to determine optimal technology approach. Design/Methods: PwMS performed 25- foot walk-(T25FW) on GAITRite-mat while wearing G-walk simultaneously. Univariate regression modeling evaluated relationships between 11 outcome parameters (Gait Domains=GD) produced by both devices. Relationships were grouped by correlation strength: high-(r≥0.50), medium-(0.30≤r≤0.49), and low-(r≤0.29).

New inexpensive outcome measures with greater sensitivity to change in disability are needed. Objective: To determine whether longitudinal evaluation with a wearable multi-sensor device (MYO) leveraged from the computer control and gaming industry can capture progression in MS. Methods: Consecutive patients with MS were followed prospectively at routine clinic visits approximately every 6 months for up to 2 years. At each visit, participants performed finger and foot taps wearing the MYO-band, which includes accelerometer, gyroscope and surface electromyogram sensors. A single scalar metric of within-patient limb progression was created by combining the change in signal waveform features over time. These upper (UE) and lower extremity (LE) metrics were compared between progressive and relapsing MS with logistic regression models with calculation of area under (AU) ROC. Pearson correlations were used to compare these metrics with baseline and change in EDSS. Results: 68 were included (53 RR, 9 PP, 6 SP) with 72% female, mean age 48 years, median disease duration 11 years, median EDSS 2.5 (range 0-7), and median follow-up 10 months. Testretest reliability was excellent (ICC 0.80-0.87). The unit-less summary metrics differentiated RR from progressive MS (LE: RR mean 823; progressive mean 1126, p< 0.001; similar difference for UE observed), with AUROC 0.83 for LE and 0.74 for UE. For every 1 standard deviation (SD) unit increase in the LE metric, there was 2.7 times the odds (95% CI 1.4-5.3) of progressive MS. For every 1 SD unit increase in the UE metric, there was 2.8 times the odds (95% CI 1.4-5.3) of progressive MS. These associations remained after adjustment for age, disease duration and sex. Higher baseline EDSS was associated with greater value of the scalar progression metric (LE r=0.41, p< 0.001; UE r=0.43, p< 0.001). The scalar metrics captured worsening in function not detected by the EDSS over short follow-up. In a subset with stable EDSS, the metric suggested subclinical progression. Conclusions: The MYO device distinguished progressive from relapsing MS and detected short-term change in function not captured by EDSS. This device, readily adaptable to clinical practice, holds great promise for rapid assessment of subtle progression.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458518798579","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458518798579&atitle=Novel+multi-sensor+algorithm+captures+subtle+progression+over+one+year+in+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=24&issue=2&spage=108&epage=109&aulast=Krysko&aufirst=K.M.&auinit=K.M.&aufull=Krysko+K.M.&coden=&isbn=&pages=108-109&date=2018&auinit1=K&auinitm=M","Embase"

It is important to correctly evaluate and improve physical activity (PA) level in this population. Objectives: The primary purpose of this study was to explore objective and subjective measurements methods of the PA level in patients with MS. The secondary aim of the study was to examine the relationship between PA level and fatigue. Methods: Forty ambulatory patients with MS (Age:35.8±10.05 years, EDSS:1.4±1.06) and thirty healthy controls (HC) (Age:36.9±10 years) participated in the study. PA level was objectively measured over a 3-day period using ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometer and reported counts per day (CPD), counts per minute (CPM), and daily step count. Additionally, PA level was subjectively measured using self-assessment with International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) long version. Fatigue was evaluated using Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). Results: The PA level was decreased in patients with MS compared to HC according to both objective and subjective assessments (p< 0.05). At the same time, in MS groups fatigue level was higher than HC. Fatigue was found to be negatively associated with CPD (r:-0.405, p:0.009), CPM (r:-0.498, p:0.001), and daily step count (r:-0.646, p< 0.001). Fatigue was found to be negatively associated with IPAQ score (r:-0.512, p:0.001). In addition, the correlation between ActiGraph GT3X+ parameters (CPA, CPM and daily step count) and IPAQ score (r: 460,415,565; p < 0.05) was observed in this study. Conclusions: These results show that both PA level measurement methods seem to be feasible in patients with MS. On the other hand, accelerometer gives us more detailed information about the daily physical activity. Therefore, we recommend the widespread use of accelerometer. At the same time, this results show that fatigue affects physical activity level even in patients with low disability level.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458518798590","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458518798590&atitle=Objective+and+subjective+assessment+of+physical+activity+in+multiple+sclerosis+and+their+relation+to+fatigue&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=24&issue=2&spage=355&epage=356&aulast=Cekim&aufirst=K.&auinit=K.&aufull=Cekim+K.&coden=&isbn=&pages=355-356&date=2018&auinit1=K&auinitm=","Embase"

Uni-axial accelerometers were the most popular objective PA tool in this review (68%). Pedometers (14%) and multi-sensor systems (3%) were the second and third most common. PA outputs included activity counts per day, steps per day, energy expenditure per day, minutes of moderate-vigorous PA (MVPA), minutes of light PA and daily dynamic activity. Both activity counts per day (n = 21 studies), and steps per day (n = 11 studies) were most commonly used representing 78%.CONCLUSION: Uni-axial accelerometers and pedometers are the most popular PA measurement tools used in MS literature. However, developments in the field mean that most new sensors are tri-axial, and multi-sensor systems are also available. Researchers should use devices with published validation information, and should utilize the detail on activity patterns available from accelerometer measurement instead of expressing a single unit such as activity counts or step counts per day. Attention to capturing the duration, frequency, intensity and energy expended during daily PA is warranted. Implications for Rehabilitation The review reports that accelerometers were the research tool most frequently reported in the literature, though there were differences in device type and in how activity data was extracted from the stored information. The majority of research studies of physical activity levels in Multiple Sclerosis fail to provide an adequate range of activity outcomes, frequently using outcomes which do not allow simple cross-comparisons with other populations.","Review","10.1080/17483107.2017.1297859","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=17483115&id=doi:10.1080%2F17483107.2017.1297859&atitle=Objective+physical+activity+measurement+in+people+with+multiple+sclerosis%3A+a+review+of+the+literature&stitle=Disabil+Rehabil+Assist+Technol&title=Disability+and+rehabilitation.+Assistive+technology&volume=13&issue=2&spage=124&epage=131&aulast=Casey&aufirst=Blathin&auinit=B.&aufull=Casey+B.&coden=&isbn=&pages=124-131&date=2018&auinit1=B&auinitm=","Embase"

Although the sensation of fatigue, tiredness, and energy level adversely affect physical activity (PA), the association between fatigability and objectively measured PA is unknown. Methods: Participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (n = 557, 50% women, aged 50-97 years) were instructed to wear an Actiheart accelerometer for 7 consecutive days in the free-living environment. Perceived fatigability was assessed using the Borg rating of perceived exertion (RPE) after 5 minutes of treadmill walking at 1.5 mph (0.67 m/s) and categorized as low (6-7 RPE), intermediate (8-9 RPE), and high (10(+) RPE) fatigability. Time-of-day PA differences between fatigability groups were assessed using mixed-effects modeling. Results: Total daily PA was 1.3% lower for every unit increment in perceived fatigability after adjusting for demographic, behavioral, and medical factors (p = .01). In time-of-day analyses, the high fatigability group was less active compared to the low fatigability group throughout the day (8: 00 am to 8: 00 pm) and the intermediate fatigability group in the morning (8: 00 am to 12: 00 pm). Patterns of PA within the high fatigability group differed from both the intermediate and low groups in the morning but mirrored the intermediate group in the afternoon and evening. Discussion: These results suggest that RPE is a bio-marker of fatigability associated with progressively lower PA with aging. Whether the effects of fatigability occurring at the end of the day reflect waning energy levels or a voluntary choice that could be modified remains to be evaluated.","Article","10.1093/GERONA/GLX181","WOS:000430696300010","WoS"

Methods Cross-sectional analysis of accelerometry (7 days) and research protocol MRI data from 12 pediatric MS and 18 children with monophasic ADS (monoADS). Total brain and DGv were quantified using standardized methods. The association of daily minutes of MVPA with normalized DGv (nDGv) was assessed using multivariable generalized linear models. Results Median (interquartile range) MVPA was lower in MS patients [9.5 (14)] and exhibited less variation than in monoADS patients [24.5 (47)]. nDGv did not differ significantly between groups [mean nDGv (SD) [cm3]: MS 0.34 (0.1); monoADS 0.4 (0.1); p = 0.100]. In the monoADS group, every 1-minute increase in MVPA was associated with a 2.4-mm3 increase in nDGv (p = 0.0017), an association that was independent of age at incident demyelination, time from incident demyelination, sex, and brain white matter T2 lesion volume. No significant association was found between MVPA and nDGv (-2.6 mm3/min, p = 0.16) in the MS group. Conclusions Higher MVPA associates with greater nDGv in children who have recovered from monophasic demyelination. Larger studies are required to determine whether MVPA can promote regional brain development, or limit tissue damage, in youth with MS.","Article","10.1212/NXI.0000000000000499","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=23327812&id=doi:10.1212%2FNXI.0000000000000499&atitle=Physical+activity+and+dentate+gyrus+volume+in+pediatric+acquired+demyelinating+syndromes&stitle=Neurol.+Neuroimmunol.+Neuroinflamm.&title=Neurology%3A+Neuroimmunology+and+NeuroInflammation&volume=5&issue=6&spage=&epage=&aulast=Longoni&aufirst=Giulia&auinit=G.&aufull=Longoni+G.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2018&auinit1=G&auinitm=","Embase"

Methods: Fourteen ambulatory patients with MS (Age: 37.3±9.3 years, EDSS: 1.08 ± 0.7) participated in the study. Measurements were performed using an accelerometer (ActiGraph GT3X+) during three consecutive days. The participants wore the accelerometers on an elastic belt around the waist at the non-dominant hip during the waking hours, except while showering, bathing and swimming during three consecutive days. Outcome measures included the following: amount of physical activity expressed in counts per day, counts per minute (CPM), and counts per day period (morning, afternoon, evening); duration ofphysical activity intensity categories (sedentary, light, moderate, vigorous, and very vigorous) over the day. Results: The CPM results of patients with MS were the following: Day CPM 430±108.7 (morning CPM 121.8±50.1, afternoon 163.5±42.7, and evening 122.1±39.7). Thephysical activity intensity category of the patients was %59.9±7.6 in the sedentary, %40.2±5.8 in the light and %3±1.8 in the moderate level.Patients spent the most time in sedentary category, especially in the morning (p<0.001). Conclusions: Detailed analyses of physical behavior showed us not only the level of physical activity but also physical behavior of the patients with MS (e.g., intensity, day patterns). Patients with MS more time is spent sedentary and less time is spent at higher physical activity intensity. The results show that the physical activity level was positively associated with physical behavior.Therefore, we think that increasing the physical levels of patients in treatment change their physical behavior.These results of this exploratory study should also be confirmed in prospective studies.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1545968318765498","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=15526844&id=doi:10.1177%2F1545968318765498&atitle=Physical+behavior+in+patients+with+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Neurorehabil.+Neural+Repair&title=Neurorehabilitation+and+Neural+Repair&volume=32&issue=4-5&spage=432&epage=&aulast=Cekim&aufirst=Kader&auinit=K.&aufull=Cekim+K.&coden=&isbn=&pages=432-&date=2018&auinit1=K&auinitm=","Embase"

We propose that the problem with exercise behavior in MS (i.e. lack of broad or increasing participation by people with MS despite evidence of meaningful benefits) might be ameliorated through the inclusion of behavior change theory in the design of exercise programs and promotion efforts, as has been undertaken in other populations such as breast cancer survivors. This paper reviews Social Cognitive Theory as an example approach for informing interventions for increasing exercise and physical activity behavior outside of MS and provides an overview of current knowledge regarding the application of this theory for physical activity in MS. We then outline future research necessary for informing trials that design, implement, and test theory-based interventions for physical activity promotion in MS. If theories of behavior change are adopted for informing exercise and physical activity research in MS, we can take a major step forward in addressing the problem of exercise and physical activity participation that has plagued the field for more than 25 years.","Review","10.1177/2055217318786745","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=20552173&id=doi:10.1177%2F2055217318786745&atitle=Promotion+of+physical+activity+and+exercise+in+multiple+sclerosis%3A+Importance+of+behavioral+science+and+theory&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.+Exp.+Transl.+Clin.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal+-+Experimental%2C+Translational+and+Clinical&volume=4&issue=3&spage=&epage=&aulast=Motl&aufirst=Robert+W&auinit=R.W.&aufull=Motl+R.W.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2018&auinit1=R&auinitm=W","Embase"

Research-grade accelerometers (i.e. ActiGraph) are considered to measure real-life mobility. Smartphone accelerometery might be an easily accessible alternative. Objectives: To explore the validity of smartphone accelerometery in comparison to clinical tests, surveys and the ActiGraph in freeliving context of pwMS and controls. Methods: 68 pwMS (EDSS: mean 3.3, median 3, range: 1.0-6.0, RRMS n= 33) and 70 matched controls (mean age: 42y, women: 65%) absolved 5-repetition sit-to-stand test (FTSTS test), timed 25 feet walk(T25FW), timed tandem walk (TTW) and 6-minute walk time (6MWT), Godin Leisure-Time (GLTEQ), Frenchay Activity Index (FAI) and the international physical activity questionnaire (IPAQ). pwMS underwent an examination for Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score and answered the 12 Item MS Walking Scale (MSWS-12). Real-life data were collected with a smartphone recording accelerometer and an ActiGraph over 7 days. Corrected for wear time, we computed correlation tests between ActiGraph (steps per minute), smartphone accelerometery (variance of vector magnitude/varVM), clinical tests and surveys. Moreover, we used t-tests to determine the ability to separate between patients and controls as well as between different disability groups. Results: ActiGraph data correlated moderately (r = 0.43, p< 0.05) with smartphone outputs, low to moderately with clinical tests (TTW, T25FW, 6MWT, r=-.23, -.20,.31, p< .05) and some questionnaires (FAI, IPAQ and MSWS-12, r=.27, .30, -.33, p< .05). Smartphone showed overall higher correlations with age and waist (r=-.48, -.23, p< .05), clinical tests (TTW, F25WT, FTSTS, 6MWT, r= -.51, -.44, -.45, .49, p< .05) and most of the questionnaires (GLETQ, FAI and MSWS-12, r=.36, .25, -.51, p< .05). ActiGraph data only differed between pwMS and controls (p< .001) but could not differentiate disability groups. Smartphone could not only differentiate pwMS and controls (p< 3∗10-7) but also RRMS and PP-/SPMS (p< 2∗10-11) and between participants with/without ambulatory impairment(p< .001). Conclusions: Smartphone accelerometery seems to provide better estimates of mobility and disability than a wrist-worn ActiGraph in free-living context for both controls and pwMS. It might thus be the first-choice measurement tool for real-life mobility.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458518798582","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458518798582&atitle=Real-life+smartphone+accelerometery+is+closer+correlated+with+disability+and+mobility+in+MS+than+a+commonly+used+wrist-worn+activity+and+mobility+tracker&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=24&issue=2&spage=159&epage=160&aulast=Zhai&aufirst=Y.&auinit=Y.&aufull=Zhai+Y.&coden=&isbn=&pages=159-160&date=2018&auinit1=Y&auinitm=","Embase"

Background: Passively collected data from consumer wearable devices (CWD) presents an opportunity to capture patient-relevant outcomes in everyday life. However, clinical relevance and applicability remains to be further explored, as research using CWD data to characterize MS patients in everyday life is lacking. Design/Methods: From medical claims of a large national insurer, we identified 9,015 individuals with MS and 18,030 age, sex and geography matched controls without MS. Of these, 498 (5.5%) MS and 1,473 (8.2%) non-MS individuals also had wearable devices data that they shared as part of a wellbeing program in which they participated. Several daily summaries of step and sleep data recorded at minute-level granularity were computed and combined with claims and demographic data over one year. Statistical tests for between-group comparisons were controlled for false discovery rate (FDR) which was set at <5%. Results: Compared to non-MS, MS patients had a lower percentage of days in which they recorded steps (73% vs 77%, p-val <0.001) and lower mean daily step counts (6,379 vs 7,188, p-val <0.001).

Objective To develop specific measures of MS-associated walking capacity through statistically sophisticated HPA analysis, thereby more precisely defining the real-world impact of disease. Methods Eighty-eight MS and 38 control subjects completed timed walks and patient-reported outcomes in clinic, then wore an accelerometer for 7 days. HPA was analyzed with several new statistics, including the maximum step rate (MSR) and habitual walking step rate (HWSR), along with conventional methods, including average daily steps. HPA statistics were validated using clinical walking outcomes. Results The six-minute walk (6MW) step rate correlated most strongly with MSR (r = 0.863, p < 10(−25)) and HWSR (r = 0.815, p < 10(−11)) rather than average daily steps (r = 0.676, p < 10(−11)). The combination of MSR and HWSR correlated more strongly with the 6 MW step rate than either measure alone (r = 0.884, p < 10(−14)). The MSR overestimated the 6 MW step rate (μ = 10.4, p < 10(−7)), whereas the HWSR underestimated it (μ = −18.2, p < 10(−19)). Conclusions Conventional HPA statistics are poor measures of capacity due to variability in activity behaviors. The MSR and HWSR are valid, specific measures of real-world capacity which capture subjects’ highest step rate and preferred step rate, respectively.","Article","10.1016/J.GAITPOST.2017.10.015","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=18792219&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.gaitpost.2017.10.015&atitle=Real-world+walking+in+multiple+sclerosis%3A+Separating+capacity+from+behavior&stitle=Gait+Posture&title=Gait+and+Posture&volume=59&issue=&spage=211&epage=216&aulast=Engelhard&aufirst=Matthew+M.&auinit=M.M.&aufull=Engelhard+M.M.&coden=GAPOF&isbn=&pages=211-216&date=2018&auinit1=M&auinitm=M","Embase"

Objectives: To develop an accurate method for remote assessment of walking speed and to test how predictive the clinic T25FW is for real-life walking. Methods: An AX3-Axivity tri-axial accelerometer was positioned on 32 MS patients (Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS] 0-6) in the clinic, who subsequently wore it at home for up to 7 days. Gait speed was calculated from these data using both a model developed with healthy volunteers and individually personalized models generated from a machine learning algorithm. Results: The healthy volunteer model predicted gait speed poorly for more disabled people with MS. However, the accuracy of individually personalized models was high regardless of disability (R-value = 0.98, p-value = 1.85 × 10(-22)).

Monitoring of these symptoms by healthcare professionals is time-consuming and sporadic. Increasing smartphone and wearable device usage offers an opportunity for continuous self-monitoring of persons with MS (pwMS). Orikami recently developed a smartphone app which pwMS can use for self-monitoring of mobility, signal processing speed, physical activity and sleep, the MS sherpa app. We aim to assess validity, reliability and responsiveness of this self-monitoring app. Furthermore, we aim to asses the value and effects of digital self-monitoring on daily life and on healthcare. Methods: We conducted a case-control study (May 2017 - May 2018) in which 25 pwMS and 79 healthy control subjects (HCs) were included. The pwMS and 21 HCs (group 1) preformed walking tests and cognitive tests with the smartphone app. These digital tests were performed every three days for one month. Furthermore, at the first and last day, each participant of group 1 performed an offline 2 minute walking test and a symbol-digit modalities test. The participants of group 1 were also asked to wear a Fitbit activity tracker. The other 58 HCs performed the three walking and three cognitive tests of the app to establish a reference range (group 2). 7 pwMS and 5 HCs from group 1 were interviewed prior and after our study to assess the value and effects of digital self-monitoring on daily life and on healthcare. Results: Our results show that pwMS performed significantly worse on the smartphone walking test (p< 0.005) and smartphone cognitive test (p< 0.045). Large (>0.8) test-retest reliability coefficients and correlation coefficients between the online and the offline measurements were found. Adherence to the protocol was 68% for the walking tests and 85% for the cognitive tests. The indepth interviews showed that participants were positive about the use of digital self-monitoring for themselves and healthcare in general: it provides lifestyle insight and supports healthy behaviour. The Fitbit for instance stimulated participants to take additional steps. On the other hand, higher disease awareness can also be confronting and some participants preferred more guidance in data interpretation. In conclusion, the MS sherpa app is a useful tool for digital self-monitoring of mobility, signal processing speed, physical activity and sleep.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458518798590","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458518798590&atitle=Self-monitoring+of+mobility%2C+signal+processing+speed%2C+physical+activity+and+sleep+by+persons+with+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=24&issue=2&spage=366&epage=&aulast=Van+Oirschot&aufirst=P.&auinit=P.&aufull=Van+Oirschot+P.&coden=&isbn=&pages=366-&date=2018&auinit1=P&auinitm=","Embase"

Background: Visual disorders are frequently characterised by optic nerve dysfunction resulting in visual field and contrast sensitivity deficits. Careful clinical evaluation is essential for diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of optic nerve disorders. Currently, the routine assessment consists of Humphrey's test for the visual field and Sloan charts for contrast sensitivity assessment; but they are time consuming and not widely available outside of specialised ophthalmology clinics. Design/Methods: We compared routine ophthalmology tests versus our application. In one group, 23 visual fields from volunteers followed-up at the Royal London Hospital eye clinic were tested and results were displayed as percentage of match between both tests. In a second group, fifteen patients with Multiple sclerosis were recruited at the neurology daycare unit and contrast sensitivity was assessed. The results were then compared using a correlation coefficient. Results: During the visual field analysis, the results concerning six eyes showed 100% match, three others presented 50% of compatibility, while three more showed results ranging from 20% to 35%. Finally, 11 eyes obtained no more than 20%; this could be explained by an excess of fixation loss - indeed, visual field's accuracy is clearly improved when fixation loss is <50% (p=0.01).

However, the effects of different types of postures and different underfoot surfaces on PB have not adequately been addressed. Purpose: The main aim of this study was to investigate the effect of different conditions of footwear, surfaces, and standing positions on static and dynamic PB ability of young ballet dancers. Methods: A total of 36 male and female young professional ballet dancers (aged 14-19 years) completed static and dynamic balance testing, measured by head and lumbar accelerometers, while standing on one leg in the turnout position, under six different conditions: (1) relaxed posture; (2) ballet posture; (3) barefoot; (4) ballet shoes with textured insoles; (5) barefoot on a textured mat; and (6) barefoot on a spiky mat. Results: A condition effect was found for static and dynamic PB. Static PB was reduced when dancers stood in the ballet posture compared with standing in the relaxed posture and when standing on a textured mat and on a spiky mat (p < .05), and static PB in the relaxed posture was significantly better than PB in all the other five conditions tested. Dynamic PB was significantly better while standing in ballet shoes with textured insoles and when standing on a spiky mat compared with all other conditions (p < .05). Conclusions: The practical implications derived from this study are that both male and female dancers should try to be relaxed in their postural muscles when practicing a ballet aligned position, including dance practice on different types of floors and on different types of textured/ spiky materials may result in skill transfer to practice on normal floor surfaces, and both static and dynamic PB exercises should be assessed and generalized into practical dance routines.","Article","10.1123/MC.2016-0076","WOS:000429380700004","WoS"

Methods: In this pilot study, 56 patients with MS (relapse remitting MS and secondary progressive MS) with prior optic neuritis (MS+ON; n=21) or without prior optic neuritis (MS-ON; n=35) and 34 age-matched controls were tested in the Aalborg, Denmark University Hospital Multilple Sclerosis Clinic using a battery of smartphone visual function tests (Landolt C acuity, Landolt C contrast sensitivity, critical flicker fusion contrast threshold at 7.5 and 15Hz, related to visual conduction speed). Testing was performed with the patient wearing their glasses. One eye was used for statistical comparisons between groups (ANOVA rank test with pairwise multiple comparisons using Dunn's method). Results: Each smartphone test took approximately 15 seconds to complete and was intuitive enough that patients were able to immediately perform the visual task. Contrast at which 15 Hz critical flicker fusion occurred provided the greatest separation between MS patients and normal subjects, with or without prior optic neuritis (see Table 1). Conclusions: Portable and rapid smartphone tests of visual function, specifically visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and flicker sensitivity, can give valuable information about the function of the afferent visual system, which could help in the triage and monitoring of MS patients and patients with other vision threatening disorders. Interestingly, critical flicker fusion, a test of visual speed of conduction, provided the greatest discrimination between eyes of MS patients with or without a previous diagnosis of optic neuritis compared to normal eyes. This finding motivates the importance of using a behavioral visual test of visual conduction speed, such as critical flicker fusion or flicker sensitivity, which is resistant to optical blur, to monitor various causes of visual dysfunction.","Conference Abstract",NA,"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=15525783&id=doi:&atitle=Smartphone+app+visual+function+tests+in+multiple+sclerosis+patients+with+and+without+optic+neuritis&stitle=Invest.+Ophthalmol.+Vis.+Sci.&title=Investigative+Ophthalmology+and+Visual+Science&volume=59&issue=9&spage=&epage=&aulast=Zarei&aufirst=Kasra&auinit=K.&aufull=Zarei+K.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2018&auinit1=K&auinitm=","Embase"

Non-wearable (motion capture systems, force platforms, and sensor-embedded walkways) and wearable (pressure and inertial sensors) biomechanical analysis systems have been developed to provide quantitative gait and balance assessments. Non-wearable systems are highly accurate, reliable and provide detailed outcomes, but require cumbersome and expensive equipment. Wearable systems provide less detail but can be used in community settings and can provide real-time feedback to patients and clinicians.

However, for most people around the world, current neurological care is poor. In low-income countries, most individuals lack access to proper neurological care, and in high-income countries, distance and disability limit access. With the global proliferation of smartphones, teleneurology - the use of technology to provide neurological care and education remotely - has the potential to improve and increase access to care for billions of people. Telestroke has already fulfilled this promise, but teleneurology applications for chronic conditions are still in their infancy. Similarly, few studies have explored the capabilities of mobile technologies such as smartphones and wearable sensors, which can guide care by providing objective, frequent, real-world assessments of patients. In low-income settings, teleneurology can increase the capacity of local care systems through professional development, diagnostic support and consultative services. In high-income settings, teleneurology is likely to promote the expansion and migration of neurological care away from institutions, incorporate systems of asynchronous communication (such as e-mail), integrate clinicians with diverse skill sets and reach new populations. Inertia, outdated policies and social barriers - especially the digital divide - will slow this progress at considerable cost. However, a future increasingly will be possible in which neurological care can be accessed by anyone, anywhere. Here, we examine the emerging evidence regarding the benefits of teleneurology for chronic conditions, its role and risks in low-income countries and the promise of mobile technologies to measure disease status and deliver care. We conclude by discussing the future trends, barriers and timing for the adoption of teleneurology.","Review","10.1038/NRNEUROL.2018.31","WOS:000431066800011","WoS"

In particular, texting has been shown to significantly alter gait patterns. However, no specific investigations have been performed on people with Multiple Sclerosis (pwMS), who are already characterized by gait dysfunctions caused by the disease. Objective To assess the existence of possible alterations in spatio-temporal parameters of gait in pwMS when simultaneously texting on a smartphone and walking. Methods Fifty-four pwMS (mean age 40.5 ± 10.5) and 40 age-matched unaffected individuals were tested in two conditions: walking, and walking while texting on a smartphone. Spatio-temporal parameters of gait were assessed using a wearable accelerometer located on the lower back. Results Texting induces reduction of gait speed, stride length and cadence in both groups, but such changes were smaller in magnitude in pwMS. An increase of stance and double support and reduction of swing phase were observed in pwMS only. Conclusions Texting alters gait patterns of pwMS differently from unaffected individuals, probably due to a different prioritization of the task, which appears to take into account the motor and sensory impairments associated with the disease by favoring the motor task.","Article","10.1016/J.MSARD.2017.11.021","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=22110356&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.msard.2017.11.021&atitle=Texting+while+walking+differently+alters+gait+patterns+in+people+with+multiple+sclerosis+and+healthy+individuals&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+Relat.+Disord.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+and+Related+Disorders&volume=19&issue=&spage=129&epage=133&aulast=Pau&aufirst=Massimiliano&auinit=M.&aufull=Pau+M.&coden=&isbn=&pages=129-133&date=2018&auinit1=M&auinitm=","Embase"

However, the time adaptation of CBT to exercise has not been frequently addressed, due to the need of unpractical rectal or expensive sensors. Six PwMS (EDSS: 5,2±1,1 [mean±SD]) and 7 BMI- and agematched control subjects were enrolled. CBT was continuously (0,5 Hz) monitored by a validated wearable and completely noninvasive skin surface head sensor, with a heat-flux approach (Double Sensor) during a standard 6 minutes walk test (6MWT) (constant room temperature: 24°C). As expected, the distance covered in the 6MWT was significantly lower (p<0,001) for PwMS patients (325±81 m) compared to control subjects (682±69 m). In the first half (3 min) of the 6MWT CBT significantly increased in both PwMS (+0,4±0,2°C; p=0,004 vs baseline) and control subjects (+0,8±0,2°C; p=0,004 vs baseline and p=0,01 vs MS patients). Conversely, CBT was significantly reduced during the second half of 6MWT in control subjects (-0,2±0,3°C, p=0,05 vs first half of 6MWT), whereas remained the same in PwMS (0,0±0,1°C, p=ns vs first half of 6MWT). PWMS seem to develop an altered thermoregulatory response to the 6MWT: CBT increases (although to a lesser extent) as in control subjects in the first half of the test but does not decrease thereafter. This suggests a reduced early metabolic adaptation and a compromised late sudo-motor response to the increment of CBT. Finally, the double sensor approach seems suitable in estimating the time course of CBT during a functional endurance test in PwMS, and may be useful to monitoring disease stages and predicting its progression.","Conference Abstract",NA,"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:&atitle=Thermoregulatory+response+to+six+minute+walk+test+in+people+with+Multiple+Scelerosis&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=24&issue=6&spage=875&epage=&aulast=Merati&aufirst=Giampiero&auinit=G.&aufull=Merati+G.&coden=&isbn=&pages=875-&date=2018&auinit1=G&auinitm=","Embase"

The Timed-Up-And-Go (TUG) task is used to assess patient mobility because it incorporates clinically-relevant submovements during standing. Most sensor-based TUG research has focused on the placement of sensors at the spine, hip or ankles; an examination of thigh activity in TUG in multiple sclerosis is wanting. Methods: We used validated sensors (x-IMU by x-io) to derive transparent metrics for the sit-to-stand (SI-ST) transition and the stand-to-sit (ST-SI) transition of TUG, and compared effect sizes for metrics from inertial sensors on the thighs to effect sizes for metrics from a sensor placed at the L3 level of the lumbar spine. Twenty-three healthy volunteers were compared to 17 ambulatory persons with MS (PwMS, HAI = 2). Results: During the SI-ST transition, the metric with the largest effect size comparing healthy volunteers to PwMS was the Area Under the Curve of the thigh angular velocity in the pitch direction-representing both thigh and knee extension; the peak of the spine pitch angular velocity during SI-ST also had a large effect size, as did some temporal measures of duration of SI-ST, although less so. During the ST-SI transition the metric with the largest effect size in PwMS was the peak of the spine angular velocity curve in the roll direction. A regression was performed. Discussion: We propose for PwMS that the diminished peak angular velocity during SI-ST directly represents extensor weakness, while the increased roll during ST-SI represents diminished postural control. Conclusions: During the SI-ST transition of TUG, angular velocities can discriminate between healthy volunteers and ambulatory PwMS better than temporal features. Sensor placement on the thighs provides additional discrimination compared to sensor placement at the lumbar spine.","Article","10.3389/FNEUR.2018.00684","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=16642295&id=doi:10.3389%2Ffneur.2018.00684&atitle=Thigh-derived+inertial+sensor+metrics+to+assess+the+sit-to-stand+and+stand-to-sit+transitions+in+the+timed+up+and+go+%28TUG%29+Task+for+quantifying+mobility+impairment+in+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Front.+Neurol.&title=Frontiers+in+Neurology&volume=9&issue=SEP&spage=&epage=&aulast=Witchel&aufirst=Harry+J.&auinit=H.J.&aufull=Witchel+H.J.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2018&auinit1=H&auinitm=J","Embase"

With the development of light, low-cost wearable technology, inertia-based fall detection has gained much attention. However, some large movements, such as jumping and postural changes, are frequently confounded with falls. For example, commonly used fall detection methods based on acceleration amplitude produce a large number of false alerts unless they are combined with post-fall posture identification. In this paper, we propose two new inertial parameters to improve the selectivity of threshold-based fall detection methods, and evaluate strategies to distinguish falls from other activities of daily life (ADLs). APPROACH: We define two new inertial parameters, acceleration cubic-product-root magnitude (ACM) and angular velocity cubic-product-root magnitude (AVCM). Along with acceleration magnitude (AM), we test threshold-based fall detection methods based on single parameters and combinations. We collected inertial data on four types of simulated falls and eight types of ADLs from a study with 15 participants wearing a chest-mounted sensor with accelerometer and gyroscope. Two public datasets, UMAFall and Cognent Labs, were also included to evaluate fall detection methods. MAIN RESULTS: We chose the detection threshold with 99% sensitivity and the best possible specificity. The hybrid of AM, ACM and AVCM method had a lower rate of misclassification than single-parameter methods. Leave-one-out cross-validation shows that the hybrid fall detection method can achieve both high specificity and high sensitivity. SIGNIFICANCE: Using multiple inertial parameters improves the specificity of fall detection.","Article","10.1088/1361-6579/AAE0EB","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13616579&id=doi:10.1088%2F1361-6579%2Faae0eb&atitle=Threshold-based+fall+detection+using+a+hybrid+of+tri-axial+accelerometer+and+gyroscope&stitle=Physiol+Meas&title=Physiological+measurement&volume=39&issue=10&spage=105002&epage=&aulast=Wang&aufirst=Fu-Tai&auinit=F.-T.&aufull=Wang+F.-T.&coden=&isbn=&pages=105002-&date=2018&auinit1=F&auinitm=-T","Embase"

The use of a smartphone involves a cognitive load on the working memory and requires physical resources to manipulate the device. This represents a source of distraction and hazard when pwMS are simultaneously engaged in other tasks like walking. Aims: To assess the effect of texting on a smartphone on spatialtemporal parameters of gait objectively assessed by means of inertial sensors. Methods: Forty-five pwMS (low disability EDSS 1-2.5, n=23, moderate disability EDSS 3-6, n=22) and 17 healthy controls were tested under two conditions: 1) walking along a 20m straight path 2) same as 1) while texting on a smartphone with a dedicated application previously employed in similar studies. Stride length, gait speed, cadence, stance, swing and double support phase were calculated. A two-way RM-ANOVA was performed to investigate differences associated with the presence of the disease and the performed task. Results: Significant effects of task and group were found for speed, stride length and cadence (p<0.001) while significant task x group interactions were detected only for speed and stride length. Healthy individuals and low-disability pwMS seems to give higher priority to texting, while individuals with moderate disability privilege walking. This results in larger speed and stride length reduction in controls and pwMS with low disability in “texting+walking” condition (-30% speed, -15% stride length) with respect to pwMS with moderate disability (-20% speed, -5% stride length). Conclusions: The smaller changes in speed and stride length found in pwMS with higher disability during the dual-task, seem to indicate that MS might induce a prioritization towards the motor task, probably due to a protective mechanisms which take into account the motor and sensory impairments associated with the disease.","Conference Abstract",NA,"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:&atitle=Use+of+inertial+sensor+to+analyze+gait+patterns+during+simultaneous+texting+and+walking+in+people+with+Multiple+Sclerosis&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=24&issue=6&spage=838&epage=&aulast=Pau&aufirst=Massimiliano&auinit=M.&aufull=Pau+M.&coden=&isbn=&pages=838-&date=2018&auinit1=M&auinitm=","Embase"

In the qualitative phase, which included focus group discussions and interviews, we collected and analysed stakeholders' attitudes and opinions. Results of the first phase was used to design the questionnaire required for the second phase. In the second phase, a questionnaire was sent to 31 physicians and 102 MS patients to quantify the challenges in use of mobile phone technologies. Results: 84% of physicians and 71% of patients were females. Age ranged from 25 to 54 years in physicians and from 18 to 65 years in patients. The level of education for the patients ranged from illiterate (1%) to Master's degree or higher (16%) with majority having high school diploma (31%) or Bachelor degree (28%).

As technology advances, newer devices require validation for measurement of step count in people with MS. Objective: Determine the validity of a consumer-grade (wristworn) accelerometer (Fitbit-Flex2), against the earlier generation Fitbit-Flex and the ActiGraph-GT3X (waist), an accelerometer commonly used in clinical research, to measure step count in people with MS. Methods: 27 people with relapsing or progressive MS enrolled in a longitudinal observational study recording activity using a Fitbit Flex were invited to participate in a 7-day home validation wearing the Fitbit Flex2 and ActiGraph. The main outcome was steps per epoch (minute and daily). Disability was assessed using the EDSS (expanded disability status scale); via an online validated-questionnaire at the time of monitoring, and in person during study check-ins. Results: The median EDSS at baseline was 4 (range 0.0-6.5). 13 (48%) of the cohort were women, and 14 (52%) had relapsingremitting MS and 48% progressive MS. High Interclass correlations between Flex and Flex2 (0.97) and between the ActiGraph and Flex2 (0.92) over 1-week of continuous activity monitoring. Bland-Altman plots showed no systematic bias between Flex2 and Flex (mean difference: 53 more steps recorded by Flex2). Bland-Altman plots showed greater number of step per day recorded by Flex2 than ActiGraph (mean difference: 1018 more steps). 93% of these data were within the 95% limits of agreement. The majority (88%) of the subjects showed no difference in wear-time for the Flex and Flex2. ActiGraph was worn for fewer hours a day than both Fitbit devices and our analysis was adjusted for usage. Accounting for MS subtype did not change the results for Flex vs Flex 2. However, in progressive MS, ActiGraph vs Flex 2 there was a significant relationship between mean difference and step count (slope: 0.237, p=0.0008). Linear regression with Bland- Altman resulted in plots with 96% falling within the limits of agreement.

The HCS yields categories of insufficiently active (less substantial or low benefits), moderately active (some benefits), and active (substantial benefits). The present study examined the validity of the GLTEQ HCS and its categories as reflecting levels of MVPA in multiple sclerosis (MS). Method: The sample included 684 persons with MS. Participants wore an accelerometer on an elastic belt around the waist above the nondominant hip during the waking hours of the day over a 7-day period and completed the GLTEQ. Results: The data analyses supported a large correlation between the GLTEQ HCS and accelerometer-measured MVPA, r = .46, p ≤ .0001, but small correlations with accelerometer-measured light physical activity (LPA), r = .16, p ≤ .001 and sedentary time, r =-.13, p = .001. There further was a large difference in accelerometer-measured MVPA between categories of physical activity levels (i.e., insufficiently active vs. active) based on the GLTEQ HCS (d = 0.89), but small differences in LPA (d = 0.39) and sedentary time (d=-0.31). Those results were unchanged in additional data analyses accounting for LPA and sedentary behavior. Conclusions: The GLTEQ HCS and categories primarily reflect MVPA rather than LPA and sedentary behavior in persons with MS.","Article","10.1037/REP0000162","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=19391544&id=doi:10.1037%2Frep0000162&atitle=Validation+of+the+godin+leisure-time+exercise+questionnaire+classification+coding+system+using+accelerometry+in+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Rehabil.+Psychol.&title=Rehabilitation+Psychology&volume=63&issue=1&spage=77&epage=82&aulast=Motl&aufirst=Robert+W.&auinit=R.W.&aufull=Motl+R.W.&coden=RHBPB&isbn=&pages=77-82&date=2018&auinit1=R&auinitm=W","Embase"

Application of technology developed in the gaming and computer control industry offers the opportunity to create new metrics with greater sensitivity and reproducibility. Objectives: To determine if a small multi-sensor, easy to use wearable device can capture limb dysfunction and subtle MS progression. Methods: Consecutive clinic patients who met published MS criteria and healthy controls were offered enrollment. Subjects completed finger and foot taps wearing the device with 3 sensors: accelerometer, gyroscope and surface electromyogram. Raw signals were processed to reduce noise and artifacts. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) assessed inter-test reproducibility. Time and waveform-based textural features were extracted from sensor data. We compared case vs. control differences with logistic regression, adjusting for age and sex. Handedness was addressed in all analyses. Extracted features were compared to disability metrics with Spearman correlation coefficients and multivariable regression methods. Patient-specific models of change over time were generated for participants returning for follow-up. Results: Baseline data for 88 participants with MS (EDSS 0-7.0) and 23 healthy controls were analyzed. ICC's for temporal signal features ranged from 0.81-0.84 for all limbs. These features dis-tinguished cases from controls even for those with EDSS<2.0 (OR 2.0 per sec, 95%CI 1.2, 3.3 p=0.01). The most informative combination of waveform textural features from all 3 sensors strongly correlated with EDSS (r(2)=0.77-0.82). In longitudinal analyses (n=56), a composite metric of irregularity in the waveforms of all sensor signals over time distinguished progressive from relapsing participants over the 1-year observation period (sensitivity 87.5%, specificity 76.9%). In one participant, a relapse event was detected by the composite metric prior to clinical detection of the event. Conclusion: Time and texture-based extracted features from this multi-sensor device demonstrated inter-test reliability, distinguished cases from controls, and demonstrated strong correlations with disability outcomes. Ideal for future generalizability in the clinic, the assessments were brief (a few minutes) and wearing of the small device was non-disruptive to a standard MS physical exam.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458517750967","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458517750967&atitle=Wearable+multi-sensor+device+captures+limb+dysfunction+and+MS+progression&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=24&issue=1&spage=18&epage=&aulast=Akhbardeh&aufirst=Alireza&auinit=A.&aufull=Akhbardeh+A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=18-&date=2018&auinit1=A&auinitm=","Embase"

Ankle joint contractures in PwMS are common and often result in compensatory gait patterns to accommodate reduced ankle range of motion (ROM). APPROACH: Using advances in wearable technology, the aim of this study was to quantify head and pelvis movement patterns that occur in PwMS with disability and determine how these secondary gait compensations impact on gait stability. Twelve healthy participants and 12 PwMS participated in the study. Head and pelvis movements were measured using two tri-axial accelerometers. Measures of gait compensation, mobility, variability, asymmetry, stability and fatigue were assessed during a 6 min walking test. MAIN RESULTS: Compared to healthy controls, PwMS had greater vertical asymmetry in their head and pelvic movements (Cohen's d  =  1.85 and 1.60). Lower harmonic ratios indicated that PwMS were more unstable than controls (Cohen's d  =  -1.61 to  -3.06), even after adjusting for their slower walking speeds. In the PwMS, increased compensatory movements were correlated with reduced ankle active ROM (r  =  -0.71), higher disability (EDSS) scores (r  =  0.58), unstable gait (r  =  -0.76), reduced mobility (r  =  -0.76) and increased variability (r  =  0.83). SIGNIFICANCE: Wearable device technology provides an efficient and reliable way to screen for excessive compensatory movements often present in PwMS and provides clinically important information that impacts on mobility, stride time variability and gait stability. This information may help clinicians identify PwMS at high risk of falling and develop better rehabilitation interventions that, in addition to improving mobility, may help target the underlying causes of unstable gait.","Article","10.1088/1361-6579/AAC0A3","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13616579&id=doi:10.1088%2F1361-6579%2Faac0a3&atitle=Wearable+technology+reveals+gait+compensations%2C+unstable+walking+patterns+and+fatigue+in+people+with+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Physiol+Meas&title=Physiological+measurement&volume=39&issue=7&spage=075004&epage=&aulast=Psarakis&aufirst=Michael&auinit=M.&aufull=Psarakis+M.&coden=&isbn=&pages=075004-&date=2018&auinit1=M&auinitm=","Embase"

Currently, assessment of these patients is mainly subjective. New assessment options using wearables may provide complementary and more objective information. Methods: In this prospective cross-sectional feasibility study performed over a four-month period, all patients referred to a normal neurology ward of a university hospital and aged between 40 and 89years were asked to participate. Gait and balance deficits were assessed with wearables at the ankles and the lower back. Frailty, sarcopenia, Parkinsonism, depression, quality of life, fall history, fear of falling, physical activity, and cognition were evaluated with questionnaires and surveys. Results: Eighty-two percent (n=384) of all eligible patients participated. Of those, 39% (n=151) had no gait and balance deficit, 21% (n=79) had gait deficits, 11% (n=44) had balance deficits and 29% (n=110) had gait and balance deficits. Parkinson's disease, stroke, epilepsy, pain syndromes, and multiple sclerosis were the most common diseases. The assessment was well accepted. Conclusions: Our study suggests that the use of wearables for the assessment of gait and balance features in a clinical setting is feasible. Moreover, preliminary results confirm previous epidemiological data about gait and balance deficits among neurological inpatients.

Here, we tested four AQP4 external loop peptides (AQP4(61-70), AQP4(131-140), AQP4(141-150), and AQP4(201-210)) with an atomic force microscopy nanoimmunosensor to develop a diagnostic assay. We obtained the highest reactivity with AQP4(61-70)-nanoimunosensor. This assay was effective in detecting AQP4-Ab in sera of NMOSD patients with 100% specificity (95% CI 63.06-100), determined by the cut-off adhesion force value of 241.3 pN. NMOSD patients were successfully discriminated from a set of healthy volunteers, patients with multiple sclerosis, and AQP4-Ab-negative patients. AQP4(61-70) sensitivity was 81.25% (95% CI 56.50-99.43), slightly higher than with the CBA method. The results with the AQP4(61-70)-nanoimmunosensor indicate that the differences between NMOSD seropositive and seronegative phenotypes are related to disease-specific epitopes. The absence of AQP4-Ab in sera of NMOSD AQP4-Ab-negative patients may be interpreted by assuming the existence of another potential AQP4 peptide sequence or non-AQP4 antigens as the antibody target.","Article","10.1038/S41598-019-52506-W","WOS:000494636500025","WoS"

Many turn to diet as a supplement to disease-modifying treatments, but research results are conflicting. We suggest a new, data-driven approach to study the diet-disease relationship in MS by collecting highfrequent, observational data on diet and MS symptoms to create a dataset that can be used to generate new hypotheses for further research. Objective: To gather an observational dataset with daily entries on diet intake (diet diaries), self-reported MS condition (short survey with 16 items), and lifestyle factors (self-reported sleep and stress) in a large-scale digital data collection. Methods: A smartphone-based solution was developed to facilitate the data collection. The solution consisted of a one-point entry app, which connected participants to baseline questionnaire, daily survey and diet intake registration (FatSecret app). Participant consent was obtained via SMS confirmation code. A number of app features, including visual overviews of participant registrations, were added to encourage adoption and participation. All members of the Danish MS Society with MS and above age 18 were invited to participate in the project. Participants were encouraged to register daily diet intake, symptoms, and lifestyle factors for up to 100 days, emphasizing that fewer days with consistent registrations were preferred to more days with sporadic registrations. Results: The digital data collection was conducted from November 2017 to March 2018. Invitations were sent to 7,249 members, and 735 signed up for the project with 312 participants completing five or more days of symptom and diet registration. The average number of participation days was 55.7, providing us with a dataset with approximately 17,400 participant days.

The strategy involves the preparation and optimisation of neutravidin-coated gold nanospheres (nGNSs) functionalised with a previously biotinylated antibody (Ab) against DNA/RNA hybrids. The Ab guarantees the recognition of any miRNA sequence adsorbed on a surface properly functionalised with different DNA probes; at the same time, gold nanoparticles permit to detect this interaction, thus producing enough SPRi signal even at a low ligand concentration. After a careful optimisation of the nanoenhancer and after its characterisation, the final assay allowed the simultaneous detection of four miRNAs with a limit of detection (LOD) of up to 0.5pM (equal to 275attomoles in 500L) by performing a single enhancing injection. The proposed strategy shows good signal specificity and permits to discriminate wild-type, single- and triple-mutated sequences much better than non-enhanced SPRi. Finally, the method works properlyin complex samples (total RNA extracted from blood) as demonstrated by the detection of four miRNAs potentially related to multiple sclerosis used as case study. This proof-of-concept study confirms that the approach provides the possibility to detect a theoretically unlimited number of miRNAs using a simple protocol and an easily prepared enhancing reagent, and may further facilitate the development of affordable multiplexing miRNA screening for clinical purposes.","Article","10.1007/S00216-018-1331-0","WOS:000463858200018","WoS"

Until today, plenty of parameters using a variety of capturing devices, e. g., video-based or by IMUs, have been developed, quantifying the most different aspects of gait [2]. Smartphones offer a quick, low-cost option to assess gait - even beyond step and activity counts [3]. Here, we present an approach that is based on estimates of the complexity and level of noise by the accelerometer signal of a low-cost smartphone. Methods: We tested 10 controls and 9 patients suffering from multiple sclerosis (MS) at the specialist clinic for neurology Medical Park Loipl, Germany (Tab. 1). Participants had a Microsoft Lumia550 smartphone attached to their sternum and walked for 10s at a self-selected pace. To estimate the complexity of the 20Hz acceleration signal (resultant vector), the quotient of arc length and integral of a 0-10 Hz discrete Fourier transformation was computed and set into relation to a 'perfect' gait pattern defined by only one frequency. Noise was estimated by the coefficient of determination of the raw and a 3 Hz low-pass filtered signal. Complexity and noise were both displayed as percentages, with 100 % being the best possible (least complex and absence of noise). Exemplary outputs of an excellent gait performance and staggering by a healthy control are displayed in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2. Results: When merged, MS patients revealed decreased complexity and noise percentages in comparison to controls (Tab. 1, Fig. 3). Discussion: In this preliminary analysis the smartphone based gait assessment already proved to be a feasible tool to examine different dimensions of gait within 10 s. Ongoing measurements will provide normative data in order to specify gait impairments in MS and other neurological diseases.

OBJECTIVE: The goal of the research was to assess the feasibility of remote active testing and passive monitoring using smartphones and smartwatch technology in people with multiple sclerosis with respect to adherence and satisfaction with the FLOODLIGHT test battery. METHODS: People with multiple sclerosis (aged 20 to 57 years; Expanded Disability Status Scale 0-5.5; n=76) and healthy controls (n=25) performed the FLOODLIGHT test battery, comprising active tests (daily, weekly, every two weeks, or on demand) and passive monitoring (sensor-based gait and mobility) for 24 weeks using a smartphone and smartwatch. The primary analysis assessed adherence (proportion of weeks with at least 3 days of completed testing and 4 hours per day passive monitoring) and questionnaire-based satisfaction. In-clinic assessments (clinical and magnetic resonance imaging) were performed. RESULTS: People with multiple sclerosis showed 70% (16.68/24 weeks) adherence to active tests and 79% (18.89/24 weeks) to passive monitoring; satisfaction score was on average 73.7 out of 100. Neither adherence nor satisfaction was associated with specific population characteristics. Test-battery assessments had an at least acceptable impact on daily activities in over 80% (61/72) of people with multiple sclerosis.

II: Assessing Workers' Physical Demand","JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT",2019,"The construction industry is one of the world's most labor-intensive industries. In it, workers are challenged almost every day by highly demanding physical tasks. Although current methods [e.g., the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)] to investigate the physical demands of various tasks provide valuable information with which to evaluate certain manual handling tasks, they may be limited to consideration of unique characteristics of each individual (e.g., physiological characteristics) and environmental conditions (e.g., ambient temperature and humidity). In other words, given the same task, different workers experience different levels of exertion. To address this problem, the objective of this research is to develop a procedure for automatic predictions of demand levels based on physiological signals collected from workers. To achieve the objective, workers' physiological signals were captured using a wristband-type biosensor while they performed regular tasks in the field. Various physiological responses were extracted from the artifact-corrected physiological signals. The rate of energy expenditure, estimated using an energy-expenditure prediction program (EEPP), was used as a baseline to separate tasks into low-, moderate-, and high-intensity activities. Then, a supervised-machine-learning model was trained by applying a Gaussian kernel support vector machine. The results led to a prediction accuracy of 90% in recognizing low and high physical-intensity levels and 87% for low, moderate, and high physical-intensity levels.

"239","Shi F.-D.","Artificial intelligence in the monitoring and management of MS","Multiple Sclerosis Journal",2019,"Development of artificial intelligence (AI) for the management of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) is underway. Using deep machine learning models, object detection and segmentation algorithms are being developed for MRI images. Auto-encoders, Boltzmann machines, and convolutional neural networks are some key algorithms applied to image segmentation and classification features. In addition to MRI images, retinal images obtained by optical coherence tomography (OCT) can also be processed in a similar manner. The European MS Consortium is adopting Voxeleron's Orion for analysis of OCT. In tracking disease activities, quantitative neurological examinations can be monitored via skin-mounted wearable sensors, depth video, and virtual reality (VR). Smartphones are used to paint a clearer picture of the consequences of MS on daily activities. AI may also be applied to improve MS patients' motor and non-motor symptoms. To cope with the physical handicap caused by MS, the UT Health Center group in Houston has examined the feasibility and benefits of exoskeleton-assisted walking in MS. The DePrexis MS application simulates functional interventions based on psychotherapy research, which has been found to have the same beneficial effects. The current and future development of MS drugs is accelerated by AI. “AtomNet” is capable streamlining the initial phase of drug discovery, which involves analyzing how different molecules interact with one another. Our group is currently coupling AI approaches with clinical, neuroimaging and immunogenomic printing data of patients with clinical isolated syndrome (CIS) with the goal of constructing an algorithm that predicts CIS conversion to MS, neuromeylitis optica, or no conversion.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458519826874","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458519826874&atitle=Artificial+intelligence+in+the+monitoring+and+management+of+MS&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=25&issue=3&spage=433&epage=&aulast=Shi&aufirst=Fu-Dong&auinit=F.-D.&aufull=Shi+F.-D.&coden=&isbn=&pages=433-&date=2019&auinit1=F&auinitm=-D","Embase"

Unfortunately, not only elder people face these issues. Neurorehabilitation is an elaborate medical specialty, which has the goal of helping people who suffer from neurological disorders recover their lost capabilities. Restoring limb control, walking, or balance are needed to assure motoric independence, while speech and psychological therapy are essential for an efficient neurorehabilitation process. However, neurorehabilitation training can become extremely costly and its accessibility might be restrained, giving the fact that existing therapists are often insufficient for the increasing number of sufferers. Furthermore, therapy expenses are usually free of charge only for a limited time period, while neurological conditions need an intensive, durable process of rehabilitation in order to show significant improvements. Individuals who see their life changing dramatically after suffering the neurological condition need to be trained and educated constantly in order to see an amelioration in their quality of life. Therefore cheaper, more accessible and flexible assistive solutions are needed. Over the past years, technology has started to play a significant role in the development of medical devices and therapies. Virtual reality, an emerging technology which has the capacity of reproducing a great variety of real-life environments and situations, is gaining more and more ground and is proven to be successful even for neurorehabilitation. We propose an innovative concept of an assistive device for neurorehabilitation training, which combines various technologies such as virtual environments, head-mounted devices, movement tracking, biosensors, emotion recognition and stress control. The system focuses on the creation of various virtual scenes where patients can relearn their lost capacities or retrain specific motions by accomplishing different training exercises. The system concentrates on four essential neurological conditions: stroke, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease and trauma of the central nervous system. Two subsystems are included: one for educating patients with neurological conditions and a second one for training medical therapists involved in the neurorehabilitation process. The main goal is to create a highly modularized system, which can be easily extended with a larger variety of exercises, suitable for a wide range of neurological conditions. We claim that our system would be suitable both for training people with neuro-motor disabilities, but also medical personnel involved in their recovery and medical students who learn recovery techniques.","Proceedings Paper",NA,"WOS:000530212402056","WoS"

More sensitive and ecologically valid outcome measures are needed to advance MS research. Objectives: To assess continuous step count activity remotely among individuals with MS for 1 year and determine how average daily step count is associated with other measures of MS disability. Design, Setting, and Participants: In a prospective longitudinal observational cohort study, 95 adults with relapsing or progressive MS who were able to walk more than 2 minutes with or without an assistive device were recruited between June 15, 2015, and August 8, 2016, and remotely monitored in their natural environment for 1 year. Patients were excluded if they had a clinical relapse within 30 days or comorbidity contributing to ambulatory impairment. Longitudinal analysis was performed from October 2017 to March 2018. Revised analysis was performed in December 2018. Intervention: Activity monitoring of step count using a wrist-worn accelerometer. Main Outcomes and Measures: Average daily step count compared with in-clinic assessments and patient-reported outcomes. Results: Of the 95 participants recruited (59 women and 36 men; mean [SD] age, 49.6 [13.6] years [range, 22.0-74.0 years]), 35 (37%) had progressive MS, and the median baseline Expanded Disability Status Scale score was 4.0 (range, 0-6.5). At 1 year, 79 participants completed follow-up (83% retention). There was a modest reduction in accelerometer use during the 1 year of the study. A decreasing average daily step count during the study was associated with worsening of clinic-based outcomes (Timed 25-Foot Walk, β = -13.09; P < .001; Timed-Up-and-Go, β = -9.25; P < .001) and patient-reported outcomes (12-item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale, β = -17.96; P < .001). A decreasing average daily step count occurred even when the Expanded Disability Status Scale score remained stable, and 12 of 25 participants (48%) with a significant decrease in average daily step count during the study did not have a reduction on other standard clinic-based metrics. Participants with a baseline average daily step count below 4766 (cohort median) had higher odds of clinically meaningful disability (Expanded Disability Status Scale score) worsening at 1 year, adjusting for age, sex, and disease duration (odds ratio, 4.01; 95% CI, 1.17-13.78; P = .03). Conclusions and Relevance: Continuous remote activity monitoring of individuals with MS for 1 year appears to be feasible. In this study, a decreasing average daily step count during a 1-year period was associated with worsening of standard ambulatory measures but could also occur even when traditional disability measures remained stable. These results appear to support the prospect of using the average daily step count as a sensitive longitudinal outcome measure in MS and as a clinically relevant metric for targeted intervention.","Article","10.1001/JAMANETWORKOPEN.2019.0570","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=25743805&id=doi:10.1001%2Fjamanetworkopen.2019.0570&atitle=Association+of+Continuous+Assessment+of+Step+Count+by+Remote+Monitoring+With+Disability+Progression+Among+Adults+With+Multiple+Sclerosis&stitle=JAMA+Netw+Open&title=JAMA+network+open&volume=2&issue=3&spage=e190570&epage=&aulast=Block&aufirst=Valerie+J.&auinit=V.J.&aufull=Block+V.J.&coden=&isbn=&pages=e190570-&date=2019&auinit1=V&auinitm=J","Embase"

Vigorous physical activity (PA) is associated with lower disease activity, depression and fatigue. However, youth with MS are inactive. Interventions focusing on modifiable factors to increase PA in this population have not been studied. To address this gap, we have developed a theory-informed PA promotion program, Active Teens with Multiple Sclerosis (ATOMIC), targeting modifiable factors (PA self-efficacy and exercise goal setting). Objective: To determine the feasibility of delivering the ATOMIC program. Aims: To evaluate feasibility metrics for delivering a theoryinformed PA promotion program for youth with MS. Methods: In this pre-post test study, youth with MS (n=15, 13F, 16.7±1.0 y.o.) followed at the Hospital for Sick Children, Canada were enrolled to receive a 12-week wearable and MS specific appbased intervention to improve PA. We delivered PA coaching, PA self-monitoring (Fitbit), goal setting, and educational modules addressing factors that may help increase PA. Telephone coaching calls performed by interviewers trained in PA counseling occurred approximately every 4 weeks. We assessed feasibility by examining patient recruitment, retention, valid days of accelerometry data (minimum 2 days with >600 minutes wear time), and adherence to wearable technology use. We evaluated change in step count through time using average number of steps/day as recorded by the Fitbit devices. Results: From March 2018 to March 2019, 44% of youth approached agreed to participate (15/34). 13% (2/15) did not start the trial. 85% (11/13) have reached the 12-week time point to date and have completed all components of the protocol. Fitbit wear was high, with an average of 88% adherence in the participants who completed the 12-week intervention. At baseline, 90% of participants satisfied predefined criteria for minimum usable accelerometer days (median 6 days (IQR2), and at 12 weeks, 100% satisfied these criteria (median 5 (IQR3)). Average step counts per week waxed and waned, varying between 7000-9299. The highest step counts were seen close to the median time of each coaching call (during weeks 1, 6 and 11). The lowest step counts were seen between coaching calls at weeks 4, 7, 10 and 12.

These measures could allow automated, objective and reliable quantification of disability and could be used in clinical monitoring and as biomarkers of disability progression in MS trials. Background: Quantification of disability in patients with MS using existing clinical tools, including the EDSS, has significant shortcomings, including the requirement for significant clinician time, poor inter- and intra-rater reliability and poor responsiveness. Design/Methods: 59 people with secondary progressive MS and 24 healthy controls were asked to perform a detailed gait analysis including a six-minute walking test during routine clinical visits. People with MS were dichotomised into moderate disability (MSm, EDSS 3.0-5.0) or severe disability (MSs, EDSS 5-6.5). Three commercially available sensors were attached to lumbar spine and ankles. Twenty gait measures were calculated and grouped into four conceptual domains (rhythm, variability, asymmetry and, balance and coordination). Between session reliability was calculated over two sessions (7-14 days apart). Differences between controls, MSm, MSs were tested using a non-parametric test with post hoc analysis with Bonferroni correction. Results: The automated analysis indicated that people with MS walked with significantly longer stride time, increased step variability and asymmetry, and reduced speed, stride length, regularity and symmetry. These measures were all significantly worse in people with MSs compared to MSm. The measures were highly reproducible with overall Intra Class Correlation Coefficient of 0.92 (above 0.9 is regarded as excellent). Conclusions: Automated gait analysis using wearable sensors is practical in the clinical setting, reproducible, and can accurately and reliably quantify walking differences between groups of people with MS with differing levels of disability. Longitudinal data are now being collected to verify sensitivity to disease progression.","Conference Abstract",NA,"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=1526632X&id=doi:&atitle=Automated+gait+analysis+using+wearable+sensors+can+detect+objective+and+reliable+quantification+of+disability+in+people+with+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Neurology&title=Neurology&volume=92&issue=15&spage=&epage=&aulast=Angelini&aufirst=Lorenza&auinit=L.&aufull=Angelini+L.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2019&auinit1=L&auinitm=","Embase"

While their problems are known, only limited evidence is available about intervention tools that could help them curb those problems. OBJECTIVE: This study was aimed at upgrading and assessing a smartphone-based technology package, which was recently developed to help those individuals to independently engage in basic communication and leisure. METHODS: The study included 11 non-ambulatory participants who had no speech or functional active communication. They were provided with (a) a Samsung A3 smartphone with Android 6.0 Operating System, which was fitted with WhatsApp Messenger and programmed via MacroDroid, and (b) cards fitted with radio frequency identification (RFID) tags. By bringing those cards in contact with the back of the smartphone, the participant could start a communication event (e.g., sending a message to a friend) or activate a leisure event (e.g., a song). The smartphone would automatically read to the participant any incoming messages. RESULTS: During the baseline (i.e., when a standard smartphone was available), the participants were unable to engage in communication or leisure. Once the aforementioned technology package was introduced, the participants spent between about 65 and 85% of their session time engaging in communication and leisure.

Although wearables represent promising tools also in multiple sclerosis (MS), the research on their application in MS is still ongoing, and further studies are required to assess their reliability and accuracy to monitor body functions and disability in people with MS (pwMS). Here, we provided a comprehensive overview of the opportunities, potential challenges, and limitations of the wearable technology use in MS. In particular, we classified previous findings within this field into macro-categories, considered crucial for disease management: assessment, monitoring, intervention, advice, and education. Given the increasing pivotal role played by wearables, current literature suggests that for pwMS, the time is right to shift from a center-based traditional therapeutic paradigm toward a personalized patient-based disease self-management.

Biotin cannot be synthesized by mammals and must be taken as an essential supplement. Normal intake of biotin from various foods and milk causes no effect on the streptavidin/biotin-based immunoassays. However, overconsumption of biotin (daily doses 100-300 mg) poses a significant problem for immunoassays using the biotin-strept(avidin) pair. Biotin interferences are noted in immunoassays of thyroid markers, drugs, hormones, cancer markers, the biomarker for cardiac function (β-human chorionic gonadotropin), etc. The biotin level required for serious interference in test results varies significantly from test to test and cannot easily be predicted. Immunoassay manufacturers with technologies based on strept(avidin)-biotin binding must investigate the interference from biotin (up to at least 1200 ng/mL or 4.9 μM of biotin) in various formats. There is no concrete solution to circumvent the biotin interference encountered in blood samples, short of biotin removal. Considering the short half-life of biotin in the human body, patients must stop taking biotin supplements for >48 h before the test. However, this scenario is not considered for patients in emergency situations or those with biotinidase deficiency, mitochondrial metabolic disorders or multiple sclerosis. Apparently, a rapid analytical procedure for biotin is urgently needed to quantify for its interference in immunoassays using strep(avidin)-biotin chemistry. To date, there is no quick and reliable procedure for the detection of biotin at below nanomolar levels in blood and biological samples. Traditional lab-based techniques including HPLC/MS-MS cannot process an enormous number of public samples. Biosensors with high detection sensitivity, miniaturization, low cost, and multiplexing have the potential to address this issue.","Review","10.1016/J.BIOTECHADV.2019.03.007","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=18731899&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.biotechadv.2019.03.007&atitle=Biotin+interference+in+immunoassays+based+on+biotin-strept%28avidin%29+chemistry%3A+An+emerging+threat&stitle=Biotechnol.+Adv.&title=Biotechnology+advances&volume=37&issue=5&spage=634&epage=641&aulast=Luong&aufirst=John+H+T&auinit=J.H.T.&aufull=Luong+J.H.T.&coden=&isbn=&pages=634-641&date=2019&auinit1=J&auinitm=H.T.","Embase"

Design: The survey was developed by two clinicians who work with REA research and prescription in the spinal cord injury (SCI) service and James A. Haley Veterans' Hospital (JAHVH). The questions pertained to the use of wearable REA that assist patients with a diagnosis of SCI, stroke, traumatic brain injury or multiple sclerosis with over ground ambulation. The survey aimed to assess knowledge and attitudes about the use of REA including the perceived availability of resources, effectiveness of REA, importance of continued research, and the clinician's confidence in referring patients for REA. Questions were analyzed in groups based on question purpose, and within and between group comparisons were completed based on the professions of the participants polled. Survey data was collected and analyzed using SurveyMonkey Enterprise software; researchers were blinded to the identity of the respondents. Participants: The survey was distributed by email to the JAHVH SCI and Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation services mailing lists via a third party staff member who was blinded and has no affiliation with the survey creators. Respondents included physicians, therapists, and nurses that work with the diagnoses listed above. Results: Results indicate that the majority of clinicians believe patients are interested in REA, that patients benefit from exoskeleton training, and that research for exoskeletons should continue. However, clinicians lack confidence in identifying appropriate candidates, especially those with a diagnosis other than SCI, and navigating the referral process. Conclusion: Findings and additional comments support the need for the development of a clearly defined clinical process for exoskeleton training and patient referral.

Despite this PA is often insufficient in this population. Considering the important health benefits of PA and the high level of physical inactivity among people with MS, identification of factors that relate to PA is both timely and relevant. This study aims to determine correlates of accelerometer derived, objectively measured light and moderate to vigorous PA levels among community-dwelling people with MS. Identifying factors that correlate with PA may assist in the development of targeted strategies to promote PA in this cohort. Methods: Sixty participants with MS (68% female, mean ± sd age 57.7 ± 11.9 yr) with mild - severe disability (Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score 1-7) completed a battery of questionnaires and wore an Actigraph wGT3X-BT accelerometer for seven days. Outcomes included walking impairment measured with the Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS-12), disease impact with the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29), fatigue with the Modified fatigue impact scale (MFIS), self-efficacy with the Multiple Sclerosis Self- Efficacy scale (MSSE), and participation and autonomy in daily living with the Impact on Participation and Autonomy questionnaire (IPA). Regression analyses were conducted using SPSS and adjusted for potential confounders (gender, age, and EDSS score). Results: Light PA was negatively associated with disease impact as measured by the physical subscale of the MSIS (β = −0.154, 95% CI = −0.274 to −0.034, p = 0.013), self-efficacy measured with the MMSE (β = 0.001, CI = 0.000 to 0.002, p = 0.005), and participation and autonomy in daily living as measured by IPA domains “autonomy indoors” (β = −0.044, 95% CI = −0.070 to −0.018, p = 0.001), “autonomy outdoors” (β = −0.031, 95% CI = −0.059 to −0.003, p = 0.033), “social life and relationships” (β = −0.025, 95% CI = −0.047 to −0.002, p = 0.032) and “family role” (β = −0.041, 95% CI = −0.074 to −0.008, p = 0.017).

Conclusion(s): Light PA was associated with disease impact, self-efficacy and participation and autonomy in daily living, whereas MVPA was associated with walking impairment, disease impact, fatigue, self-efficacy and participation and autonomy in daily living. PA is a complex behaviour in people with MS with multiple correlates that differ based on PA intensity. Implications: Both modifiable and non-modifiable factors are associated with levels of PA in people with MS. Future interventions targeting the modifiable variables should be developed and evaluated to address the disproportionate levels of inactivity present in in this population.

However, it is unclear how physical activity and symptoms correlate on a day-to-day basis in persons with MS. Purpose: To determine the temporal within-person associations of pain, fatigue, depressed mood, and perceived cognitive function with physical activity in MS. Methods: Ambulatory adults with MS (N = 107) completed 7 days of home monitoring. Continuous physical activity data (assessed via wrist-worn accelerometer) and concurrent ecological momentary assessment (5X/day) of pain, fatigue, depressed mood, and perceived cognitive function were collected. Data were analyzed using multilevel mixed modeling. Results: Fatigue and depressed mood demonstrated bidirectional associations with physical activity, whereas pain and cognitive function did not. Higher than usual fatigue (B = -5.83, p = .001) and depressed mood (B = -4.12, p = .03) were followed by decreased physical activity. In contrast, higher than usual physical activity was associated with subsequent decline in fatigue (B = -0.001, p = .02) and depressed mood (B = -0.0007, p = .02); however, the association between physical activity and fatigue varied across the day. Conclusions: Physical activity is dynamically related to fatigue and mood on a moment-to-moment basis in MS. Efforts to increase physical activity in MS must incorporate a focus on how symptoms affect and are affected by activity.","Article","10.1093/ABM/KAY018","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=15324796&id=doi:10.1093%2Fabm%2Fkay018&atitle=Daily+Temporal+Associations+Between+Physical+Activity+and+Symptoms+in+Multiple+Sclerosis&stitle=Ann+Behav+Med&title=Annals+of+behavioral+medicine+%3A+a+publication+of+the+Society+of+Behavioral+Medicine&volume=53&issue=1&spage=98&epage=108&aulast=Kratz&aufirst=Anna+L.&auinit=A.L.&aufull=Kratz+A.L.&coden=&isbn=&pages=98-108&date=2019&auinit1=A&auinitm=L","Embase"

Digital technologies, including smartphone applications, have shown great potential in supporting PwMS who experience cognitive challenges (CC). However, no solutions have been developed in a Danish contexts and very little is known about needs and priorities/ preferences from a patient perspective. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate PwMS' views and preferences regarding the use of apps as a tool to cope with CC. Methods: A focus group discussion (FGD) with eight PwMS was conducted. Data was analyzed via thematic analysis. Further, an online survey was carried out among a sample of 482 PwMS. Response rate was 83% (N=400). Descriptive analyses were performed on respondents who reported experiencing CC (62 %, N=245). Results: The main finding from the FGD was that participants requested solutions that could point them toward existing tools (e.g. calendars, reminder apps, cognitive training apps etc.) that would be relevant to them in their specific situation. Fifty-four percent of survey respondents (N=208) believed that an app targeted people with CC could be a helpful tool in performing activities of daily living. Twelve potential elements that an app could contain were suggested in the survey. The following three were rated to be of highest relevance: 1. Expert advice on 'real-life strategies' to cope with CC (88 %, N=202), 2. Information on correlations between fatigue and CC (86%, N=197), and 3. Tests to obtain deeper insight into individual cognitive functions and dysfunctions (81%, N=185). Conclusion: The study results indicate that what PwMS who experience CC request from a digital tool is information on how to cope with CC that is based on individual needs assessments.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458519844447","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458519844447&atitle=Designing+an+app+to+support+people+with+multiple+sclerosis+who+experience+cognitive+challenges&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=25&issue=7&spage=1060&epage=&aulast=Bergien&aufirst=Sofie+O.&auinit=S.O.&aufull=Bergien+S.O.&coden=&isbn=&pages=1060-&date=2019&auinit1=S&auinitm=O","Embase"

We aimed to determine which gait features become worse during sustained walking and to examine the clinical correlates of gait fatigability in pwMS. Fifty-eight pwMS performed the 6-min walk test while wearing body-fixed sensors. Multiple gait domains (e.g., pace, rhythm, variability, asymmetry and complexity) were compared across each minute of the test and between mild- and moderate-disability patient groups. Associations between the decline in gait performance (i.e., gait fatigability) and patient-reported gait disability, fatigue and falls were also determined. Cadence, stride time variability, stride regularity, step regularity and gait complexity significantly deteriorated during the test. In contrast, somewhat surprisingly, gait speed and swing time asymmetry did not change. As expected, subjects with moderate disability (n = 24) walked more poorly in most gait domains compared to the mild-disability group (n = 34). Interestingly, a group × fatigue interaction effect was observed for cadence and gait complexity; these measures decreased over time in the moderate-disability group, but not in the mild group. Gait fatigability rate was significantly correlated with physical fatigue, gait disability, and fall history. These findings suggest that sustained walking affects specific aspects of gait, which can be used as markers for fatigability in MS. This effect on gait depends on the degree of disability, and may increase fall risk in pwMS. To more fully understand and monitor correlates that reflect everyday walking in pwMS, multiple domains of gait should be quantified.","Article in Press","10.1007/S00415-019-09500-Z","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14321459&id=doi:10.1007%2Fs00415-019-09500-z&atitle=Deterioration+of+specific+aspects+of+gait+during+the+instrumented+6-min+walk+test+among+people+with+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=J.+Neurol.&title=Journal+of+Neurology&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Shema-Shiratzky&aufirst=&auinit=S.&aufull=Shema-Shiratzky+S.&coden=JNRYA&isbn=&pages=-&date=2019&auinit1=S&auinitm=","Embase"

Methods: Adult patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) were interviewed to elicit fatigue-related symptoms and impacts. A draft questionnaire was debriefed in cognitive interviews with further RRMS patients, and revised. Content confirmation interviews were conducted with patients with progressive-relapsing multiple sclerosis (PRMS) and relapsing secondary-progressive multiple sclerosis (RSPMS). Psychometric analyses used data from adult patients with different RMS subtypes and matched non-RMS controls in a multicenter, observational study. After item reduction, the final instrument was migrated to a smartphone (eDiary) and usability was confirmed in interviews with additional adult RMS patients. Results: The qualitative stage included 37 RRMS, 5 PRMS, and 5 RSPMS patients. Saturation of concepts was reached during concept elicitation. Cognitive interviews confirmed that participants understood the instructions, items, and response options of the instrument—named FSIQ-RMS—as intended. Psychometric validation included 164 RMS and 74 control patients. Internal consistency and test–retest reliability were demonstrated. The symptoms domain discriminated along the RMS symptom-severity continuum and between patients and controls. Patients were able to attribute fatigue-related symptoms to RMS. Usability and conceptual equivalence of the eDiary were confirmed (n = 10 participants).

Firstly, it is crucial to develop strategies that recognize the locomotion mode, indicating the state of the subject in various situations. This article aims to develop a strategy capable of identifying normal gait, the pre-fall condition, and the fall situation, based on a wearable system (IMUs-based). This system was used to collect data from healthy subjects that mimicked falls. The strategy consists, essentially, in the construction and use of classifiers as tools for recognizing the locomotion modes. Two approaches were explored. Associative Skill Memories (ASMs) based classifier and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier based on deep learning. Finally, these classifiers were compared, providing for a tool with a good accuracy in recognizing the locomotion modes. Results have shown that the accuracy of the classifiers was quite acceptable. The CNN presented the best results with 92.71% of accuracy considering the pre-fall step different from normal steps, and 100% when not considering.","Article","10.1007/S10916-019-1252-2","WOS:000463654500002","WoS"

For service providers, it is important to consider how consumers can take full advantage of available services and how this can create an enabling environment. However, it is important to consider the digital context and the attributes of current and future users, such as their readiness (ie, knowledge, skills, and attitudes, including trust and motivation). OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate how the eHealth Literacy Questionnaire (eHLQ) combined with selected dimensions from the Health Education Impact Questionnaire (heiQ) and the Health Literacy Questionnaire (HLQ) can be used together as an instrument to characterize an individual's level of health technology readiness and explore how the generated data can be used to create health technology readiness profiles of potential users of health technologies and digital health services. METHODS: We administered the instrument and sociodemographic questions to a population of 305 patients with a recent cancer diagnosis referred to rehabilitation in a setting that plans to introduce various technologies to assist the individuals. We evaluated properties of the Readiness and Enablement Index for Health Technology (READHY) instrument using confirmatory factor analysis, convergent and discriminant validity analysis, and exploratory factor analysis. To identify different health technology readiness profiles in the population, we further analyzed the data using hierarchical and k-means cluster analysis. RESULTS: The confirmatory factor analysis found a suitable fit for the 13 factors with only 1 cross-loading of 1 item between 2 dimensions. The convergent and discriminant validity analysis revealed many factor correlations, suggesting that, in this population, a more parsimonious model might be achieved. Exploratory factor analysis pointed to 5 to 6 constructs based on aggregates of the existing dimensions. The results were not satisfactory, so we performed an 8-factor confirmatory factor analysis, resulting in a good fit with only 1 item cross-loading between 2 dimensions. Cluster analysis showed that data from the READHY instrument can be clustered to create meaningful health technology readiness profiles of users. CONCLUSIONS: The 13 dimensions from heiQ, HLQ, and eHLQ can be used in combination to describe a user's health technology readiness level and degree of enablement. Further studies in other populations are needed to understand whether the associations between dimensions are consistent and the number of dimensions can be reduced.","Article","10.2196/10377","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14388871&id=doi:10.2196%2F10377&atitle=Development+of+the+Multidimensional+Readiness+and+Enablement+Index+for+Health+Technology+%28READHY%29+Tool+to+Measure+Individuals%27+Health+Technology+Readiness%3A+Initial+Testing+in+a+Cancer+Rehabilitation+Setting&stitle=J.+Med.+Internet+Res.&title=Journal+of+medical+Internet+research&volume=21&issue=2&spage=e10377&epage=&aulast=Kayser&aufirst=Lars&auinit=L.&aufull=Kayser+L.&coden=&isbn=&pages=e10377-&date=2019&auinit1=L&auinitm=","Embase"

Purpose: This study involved a secondary analysis of data focused on SCT constructs as correlates of individual-level changes (i.e., response heterogeneity)following a behavioral intervention. Method: Twenty-two persons with MS who completed a 6-month SCT-based behavioral intervention for increasing physical activity were included in analyses. The intervention consisted of two primary components, namely a dedicated Internet website and one-on-one video chats with a behavioral coach. Outcomes included objectively-measured moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA)using Actigraph model GT3X+ accelerometers and self-reported physical activity using the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ)as well as SCT variables of exercise self-efficacy, barriers self-efficacy, outcome expectations, goal setting and planning and facilitators/impediments. Results: There was individual variability in physical activity change following the intervention. For example, 4/22 participants demonstrated a reduction in MVPA, 1/22 participants had no change, 9/22 participants had less than 0.5 standard deviation (SD)increase in MVPA, and 8/22 participants had an increase in MVPA of more than 0.5 SD. Baseline SCT variables, particularly outcome expectations, goal setting, planning, and barriers self-efficacy, correlated with increased physical activity. Conclusions: This study indicates that SCT variables correlate with the response heterogeneity associated with physical activity behavioral interventions, and this might inform the delivery of interventions consistent with Bandura's stepwise implementation model for optimizing the “fit” of an intervention based on SCT for maximizing treatment efficacy in MS.","Article","10.1016/J.CONCTC.2019.100366","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=24518654&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.conctc.2019.100366&atitle=Do+Social+Cognitive+Theory+constructs+explain+response+heterogeneity+with+a+physical+activity+behavioral+intervention+in+multiple+sclerosis%3F&stitle=Contemp.+Clin.+Trials+Comm.&title=Contemporary+Clinical+Trials+Communications&volume=15&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Silveira&aufirst=Stephanie+L.&auinit=S.L.&aufull=Silveira+S.L.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2019&auinit1=S&auinitm=L","Embase"

Previous studies have identified several parameters of head stability with possible diagnostic value in a laboratory setting. Recently, the ecological validity of measures obtained in such controlled contexts has been called into question. The aim of this study was to investigate the ecological validity of previously described parameters of head stabilization in a real-world setting. Ten healthy subjects participated in the study. Head and trunk movements of each subject were recorded with inertial measurement units (IMUs) for a period of at least 10 h. Periods of locomotion were extracted from the measurements and predominant frequencies, root mean squares (RMSs) and bout lengths were estimated. As parameters of head stabilization, attenuation coefficients (ACs), harmonic ratios (HRs), coherences, and phase differences were computed. Predominant frequencies were distributed tightly around 2 Hz and ACs, HRs, and coherences exhibited the highest values in this frequency range. All head stability parameters exhibited characteristics consistent with previous reports, although higher variances were observed. These results suggest that head stabilization is tuned to the 2 Hz fundamental frequency of locomotion and that previously described measures of head stability could generalize to a real-world setting. This is the first study to address the ecological validity of these measures, highlighting the potential use of head stability parameters as diagnostic tools or outcome measures for clinical trials. The low cost and ease of use of the IMU technology used in this study could additionally be of benefit for a clinical application.","Article","10.3389/FNHUM.2019.00179","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=16625161&id=doi:10.3389%2Ffnhum.2019.00179&atitle=Ecological+momentary+assessment+of+head+motion%3A+Toward+normative+data+of+head+stabilization&stitle=Front.+Human+Neurosci.&title=Frontiers+in+Human+Neuroscience&volume=13&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Hausamann&aufirst=Peter&auinit=P.&aufull=Hausamann+P.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2019&auinit1=P&auinitm=","Embase"

There is little knowledge about potential relationships of 2MWT performance and free-living walking performance in pwMS, which is usually measured as average steps per day using accelerometers. Since the 2MWT is a measure of walking speed, intensity of free-living walking should be taken into account when judging ecological validity of the 2MWT. Methods: To evaluate ecological validity of the 2MWT in pwMS, we compared 2MWT intensity (steps/minute) with the intensity of free-living physical activity. Participants were asked to wear an accelerometer (ActiGraph GT3X+) for seven consecutive days. Average minutes per day reaching the cadence achieved in the 2MWT were calculated for each participant. To see if there is an intensity-dependant gradient, we also calculated the number of average daily minutes reaching 90%, 80% and 70% of the 2MWT cadence. In addition, correlations (Spearman-Rho) were calculated for perceived fatigue (Wurzburg Fatigue Inventory in Multiple Sclerosis) and walking ability (Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS-12)). Results: Analyses were performed within a currently running project (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03750097). At the time, data from 18 patients (f:15; m:3) was available. Only 5 participants showed at least one daily minute of free-living walking equalling 2MWT intensity (mean 5.87±3.55 min/day). 12 participants reached 90% of 2MWT cadence for at least one minute (6.90±5.55 min/day). All patients reached 80% and 70% (13.29±9.26 min/day resp. 21.78±11.96 min/day). Correlations were found between physical fatigue and minutes with 100% 2MWT cadence (r= -.501; p= .034), and between the MSWS-12 and minutes with 80% resp. 70% of 2MWT cadence (r= -.552; p= .017 resp. r= -.557; p= .016). Conclusions: Only about 1/4 of participants replicated 2MWT cadence for at least one minute/day during habitual walking over 7 days, which questions the ecological validity of the 2MWT. The reduction of the 2MWT intensity (cadence) to a given percentage (90-70%) may lead to ecologically valid and promising parameters that may also be targets for physical activity promotion interventions. Correlations with the MSWS-12 support the potential relevance of free-living, intensity-based physical activity parameters. Further studies with larger sample sizes are warranted.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458519868080","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13524585&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458519868080&atitle=Ecological+validity+of+the+two+minute+walk+test+in+persons+with+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=25&issue=&spage=415&epage=&aulast=Weis&aufirst=V.&auinit=V.&aufull=Weis+V.&coden=&isbn=&pages=415-&date=2019&auinit1=V&auinitm=","Embase"

Key to the utility of RW studies is their ability to complement data from RCTs in order to address issues around the uncertainty of the evidence base (the long-term and comparative effectiveness and safety of treatment strategies, prediction of treatment response, factors that impact treatment safety and tolerability and pregnancy outcome). In the last years, the increasing amounts of RW data (RWD) collected in MS registries, administrative databases and health electronic records, the evolution in information technology infrastructure and the corresponding ability to store and process these data drove an exponential growth of RW studies of MS treatment effectiveness. The results from these studies are providing invaluable insights for directing MS intervention strategies in daily practice. There are ongoing efforts to merge data across registries and to incorporate data from other data sources (patient-reported outcomes, imaging and non-imaging biomarkers and data from wearable biosensors). Regulatory bodies (FDA, EMA) and pharma companies have stated their ambition for greater use of RWD for treatment decision making, post-approval surveillance studies (PASS) and pricing and reimbursement decisions. Leaders of national MS registries of Denmark, France, Italy and Sweden and the international MSBase (Big MS Data Network) came together with pharma to perform PASS on registry data for identification of serious adverse events of new MS therapies. Since RWD are still vulnerable to a range of biases and confounding, stringent methods to improve the data quality, to standardize and validate data within datasets, to combine and harmonize data across datasets, and the development of advanced statistical techniques are required. A number of initiatives are emerging in an attempt to meet this overwhelming need. By asking the right questions with the right data and the right methods, the potential of RW studies in closing gaps in our knowledge of MS treatment and directing or refining treatment guidelines will continue to expand.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458519868070","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13524585&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458519868070&atitle=ECTRIMS+lecture%3A+Beyond+RCTs-why+and+how+observational+studies+will+guide+the+future+of+MS+treatment&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=25&issue=&spage=16&epage=&aulast=Trojano&aufirst=M.&auinit=M.&aufull=Trojano+M.&coden=&isbn=&pages=16-&date=2019&auinit1=M&auinitm=","Embase"

Background: PWP are at increased risk of falls due to postural instability. Common interventions for management of postural instability in these patients often have inadequate benefits. There is a need for interventions that can improve balance in this population. BBTW, a Commercially available device that uses weight placements based on individual responses to balance perturbations, has shown improvement of gait and balance in patients with multiple sclerosis.1 Methods: Using the Mobility Lab system (APDM) with 6 wearable sensors placed on feet, wrists, sacrum and sternum, we objectively assessed different aspects of balance, namely static balance (quiet standing), preparation to gait (Anticipatory Postural Adjustments), ongoing gait and turning in 20 PWP. Trials were: 1) baseline (BBTW without weights), 2) BBTW with therapeutic weights, 3) BBTW with sham weights. Order of the last two conditions was randomized. Patient and clinician global impression of change (PGIC, CGI respectively) evaluated changes in gait after each condition. Subjects and raters were blinded to treatment arms. Mixed-effect models was used accounting for repeated measurements over time and serial correlation within individual subjects. Results: Twenty subjects completed the study. All subjects were men, age 70.4±10 years. There was no significant improvement in quiet stance, ongoing gait or turn between sham and therapeutic groups. The only positive outcome was Postural preparation to gait (APA magnitude) that showed significant improvement with therapeutic weights ( Sham (Mean ± SD): 0.43 ± 0.25 and therapeutic weight: 0.29± 0.11, p = 0.01). There was no difference between patient or physician's report of change with therapeutic or sham weights (p= 1.00 and p = 0.66 respectively). Conclusions: In this pilot study, using BBTW did not acutely improve objective gait measures in PWP except for APA. Limitations include small sample size, short duration of BBTW treatment and many objective measurements tested which could lead to false positives related to multiple comparisons. However, APA can minimize postural perturbations that are about to occur and influence balance. longer studies and larger cohort are warranted to examine benefits and mechanisms of BBTW rehabilitation outside of office settings.","Conference Abstract",NA,"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=15318257&id=doi:&atitle=Effect+of+balanced+based+torso+weighting+on+gait+in+parkinsonism&stitle=Mov.+Disord.&title=Movement+Disorder&volume=34&issue=&spage=S297&epage=&aulast=Safarpour&aufirst=D.&auinit=D.&aufull=Safarpour+D.&coden=&isbn=&pages=S297-&date=2019&auinit1=D&auinitm=","Embase"

Those analytical devices are able to detect peptides, antibodies and proteins in various sample matrices, without many steps of sample pretreatment. Their high sensitivity, low cost and the easy integration in point of care devices assuring portability are attracting features that justify the increasing interest in their development. The use of nanomaterials, simultaneous multianalyte detection and integration on platforms to form point-of-care devices are promising tools that can be used in clinical analysis for early diagnosis and therapy monitoring in several pathologies. Taking into account the growing incidence of autoimmune disease and the importance of early diagnosis, electrochemical biosensors could represent a viable alternative to currently used diagnosis methods.

They are not only able to informon the evolution of diseases but also to predict some illnesses well in advance. Currently, the evaluation of the number and type of formed AAbs is employed to assess the risk, rate, severity and progression of autoimmune and cancer diseases, and to help find therapies to prevent or mitigate the impact of these illnesses. Conventional methods for the determination of AAbs generally suffer from low sensitivity, time-consuming and laborious methodologies, and need specialized technicians and well-equipped labs. Consequently, seeking new methodologies for the rapid and low-cost screening of AAbs is of great interest for global health because it would shorten the delay between sample collection and diagnosis and improve the introduction of modern diagnostics into the developing world. Electrochemical biosensors are considered as a promising alternative to conventional techniques for the determination of clinical biomarkers due to their simplicity of use, low cost, high sensitivity, multiplexing abilities or compatibility with microfabrication and point of care testing. This review is focused on the critical discussion of selected electrochemical biosensors described to date for the determination of AAbs related to autoimmune diseases and several types of cancer.

This study sought to investigate potential barriers and facilitators for uptake and sustained use in (i) people with both relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) and progressive MS (PMS) and (ii) across different countries. Methods: Twenty four participants with MS took part in four focus groups held in three countries (2 in the UK, 1 in Spain, and 1 in Italy) to investigate potential barriers and facilitators for mHealth technology. A systematic thematic analysis was used to extract themes and sub-themes. Results: Facilitators and barriers were organised into functional technology-related factors and non-functional health-related and user-related factors. Twelve themes captured all requirements across the three countries for both RRMS and PMS. Key requirements included accommodation for varying physical abilities, providing information and memory aids. Potential negative effects on mood and providing choice and control as part of overcoming practical challenges were identified. Conclusions: We took a cross-national perspective and found many similarities between three European countries across people with RRMS and PMS.

While sophisticated quantitative techniques (i.e. motion capture systems, accelerometer and inertial systems, etc.) are available and successfully tested in pwMS, there is a certain lack of low-cost, low-complexity systems suitable to be employed in the daily clinical routine. The use of systems originally designed for entertainment purposes, like the Kinect, may represent a good chance to obtain real-time data about gait with reduced time and costs. Aims: To verify the feasibility of a Kinect-based system to assess spatio-temporal parameters of gait in pwMS. Methods: Thirty-one pwMS (12M, 19F mean age 48.6, EDSS 3.5) and 29 healthy controls (HC) were recruited for the study. They underwent two gait analysis. The first one consisted in a 6-meter walk and data were acquired by a Kinect located in the same axis of the walking direction and oriented towards the participants. The second one consisted in a 12-meter walk and data were acquired using a previously validated inertial sensor. Raw data were processed to calculate speed, cadence, stride and step length. Differences in gait parameters between HC and pwMS were assessed using one-way MANOVA. Results: PwMS performed worse than HC in all the investigated parameters regardless the system used for the measurement. In particular, the Kinect detected reduced gait speed (1.18 vs.0.87, p<0.01), stride length (1.32 vs.1.08, p<0.01), cadence (107.67 vs.96.69, p<0.04) and step length (0.67 vs.0.53, p<0.01).

Considering this, regular gait analysis is important to monitor disease progression and where necessary, intervene as early as possible. The 2-minute walk test (2MWT) is an important ingredient of a structured gait testing battery, assessing the distance a patient is able to walk during two minutes.Objective: To calculate patients walking distance during 2MWT by an artificial intelligence approach based on measurement data from a wearable sensor system. Material and methods: This study included 500 2MWT, performed at the Multiple Sclerosis Center of University Hospital Dresden (ethical approval: EK 224062011), using wearable Mobility Lab Systems opal sensors. To date, there is no feature to show the walking distance after completion the 2MWT, though numerous spatial and temporal gait parameters can be extracted. Utilizing TensorFlow, we designed an artificial neural network, which takes 92 aggregated Mobility Lab sensor data as input and was trained against the manually measured walking distance. The network consists of three layers with 276 neurons each. The data was split into a training (80%) and a validation set (20%) and the network was optimized by the Adam Algorithm. Results: After training the network on a commercially available PC the predicted walking distances of the validation set had a relative error of approximately 5,9%, respectively 90% of the predictions indicated an absolute error of < 18m, i.e., a relative error of 13%. Only 4,5% should be regarded as outliers (absolute error >25m). Conclusion: It is a promising approach to define patients walking distance during 2MWT via artificial intelligence with potential for clinical applicability. Consequently, monitoring of disability progression reaches a new landmark with the chance to determine personalized patients gait performances more precisely and faster, contributing to earlier therapeutic improvement and accordingly long-term patient outcome.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458519868078","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13524585&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458519868078&atitle=Gait+analysis+in+multiple+sclerosis-calculation+of+2-minute+walk+%282MWT%29+walking+distance+by+artificial+intelligence&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=25&issue=&spage=184&epage=&aulast=Weidemann&aufirst=M.L.&auinit=M.L.&aufull=Weidemann+M.L.&coden=&isbn=&pages=184-&date=2019&auinit1=M&auinitm=L","Embase"

Herein, we prepared an IGPE thin film, in which an ion-diffusing phase containing ionic liquids and lithium salts was bicontinuously intertwined with a cross-linked epoxy phase, using a silicon elastomer-based stamping method, thus producing a homogeneous IGPE-based thin film with low surface roughness (Rrms = 0.5 nm). Following the optimization of the IGPE thin film in terms of the concentrations of ionic constituents, the film thickness, and various process parameters, the IGPE itself showed a high ionic conductivity of 0.23 mS/cm with a low activation energy for lithium-ion transport, as well as the high capacitance of approximately 10 μF/cm2 based on the metal-insulator-metal configuration. Furthermore, an all-solid-state supercapacitor containing two IGPE coating-activated carbon electrodes produced using our poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) stamping method exhibited high energy and power densities (44 W h/kg at 875 W/kg and 28 kW/kg at 3 W h/kg). It was also found that this supercapacitor showed a dramatic reduction (more than 50%) of the current-resistance (IR) drop, which is an indicator of low interface resistance, while maintaining the initial electrochemical performance even after severe mechanical deformation such as bending or rolling. Therefore, all these results support the fact that our developed PDMS stamping method enables the rendering of a high-performance ion gel polymer thin-film-based electrolyte with acceptable stability and mechanical flexibility for all-solid-state wearable energy storage devices.","Article","10.1021/ACSAMI.9B14990","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=19448252&id=doi:10.1021%2Facsami.9b14990&atitle=Highly+Flexible+and+Stable+Solid-State+Supercapacitors+Based+on+a+Homogeneous+Thin+Ion+Gel+Polymer+Electrolyte+Using+a+Poly%28dimethylsiloxane%29+Stamp&stitle=ACS+Appl+Mater+Interfaces&title=ACS+applied+materials+%26+interfaces&volume=11&issue=45&spage=42221&epage=42232&aulast=Lee&aufirst=Dawoon&auinit=D.&aufull=Lee+D.&coden=&isbn=&pages=42221-42232&date=2019&auinit1=D&auinitm=","Embase"

However, it is not fully clear what gait features are more implicated in influencing amount and intensity of PA. Objective and quantitative measurements of gait and PA may provide useful information to better elucidate their relationship. Aims: To assess the existence of possible correlations between main spatio-temporal and kinematic parameters of gait (assessed using motion capture system) and amount and intensity of PA estimated on the basis of wearable accelerometers data. Methods: Sixteen pwMS (8M, 8F, mean age 55.7) with mild-moderate disability (mean EDSS 3.3) underwent a quantitative 3D gait analysis and were provided a validated accelerometer (Actigraph wGT3X-BT) wrist-worn for at least 7 days 24h/day. Spatiotemporal (i.e. speed, step length, cadence, duration of stance, swing and double support phases) and kinematic parameters of gait (Gait Profile Score and Gait Variable Scores for 9 relevant movements) were correlated with amount and intensity of PA (i.e. daily steps, percentage of sedentary, light, moderate and vigorous activity) using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient rho. Results: Number of daily steps was found negatively correlated with duration of stance and double support phase (rho =-0.55, p=0.026, rho=-0.51, p=0.043) and positively correlated with swing phase duration (rho =0.55, p=0.026). Step length was found positively correlated with percentage of time spent in PA of moderate intensity (rho =0.53, p=0.033). Double support phase was found also significantly correlated with amount of PA of light and moderate-to-vigorous PA (rho =0.56 and -0.59 respectively, p=0.024). The number of daily steps was found negatively correlated with GVS of knee flexion-extension and ankle plantardorsi- flexion (rho =-0.51 to -0.52, p< 0.05). Conclusions: Our data suggest that the most relevant determinants associated with higher and more intense level of physical activity in free-living conditions are the duration of stance, swing and double support phase (the latter connected with balance abilities) and step length. In terms of kinematics, a better functionality of knee and ankle joints is associated with higher daily steps. Such findings might be useful to better target rehabilitative intervention.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458519868081","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13524585&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458519868081&atitle=How+gait+abilities+impact+amount+and+intensity+of+physical+activity+in+people+with+multiple+sclerosis%3F+a+quantitative+study&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=25&issue=&spage=802&epage=803&aulast=Pau&aufirst=M.&auinit=M.&aufull=Pau+M.&coden=&isbn=&pages=802-803&date=2019&auinit1=M&auinitm=","Embase"

To achieve this, a digital data collection tool needs to address potential barriers and motivations for participation. This study aimed to identify factors that may affect motivation for participation and adoption of a digital data collection tool in a research project on nutrition and multiple sclerosis (MS). The study was designed as a sequential mixed methods study with 3 phases. In phase 1, 15 semistructured interviews were conducted in a Danish population of individuals with MS. Interview guide frameworks were based on dimensions from the electronic health literacy framework and the Health Education Impact Questionnaire. Data from phase 1 were analyzed in a content analysis, and findings were used to inform the survey design in phase 2 that validates the results from the content analysis in a larger population. The survey consisted of 14 items, and it was sent to 1000 individuals with MS (response rate 42.5%). In phase 3, participants in 3 focus group interviews discussed how findings from phases 1 and 2 might affect motivation for participation and adoption of the digital tool. The following 3 categories related to barriers and incentives for participation were identified in the content analysis of the 15 individual interviews: (1) life with MS, (2) use of technology, and (3) participation and incentives. Phase 1 findings were tested in phase 2's survey in a larger population (n=1000). The majority of participants were comfortable using smartphone technologies and participated actively on social media platforms. MS symptoms did cause limitations in the use of Web pages and apps when the given pages had screen clutter, too many colors, or too small buttons. Life with MS meant that most participants had to ration their energy levels. Support from family and friends was important to participants, but support could also come in the form of physical aids (walking aids and similar) and digital aids (reminders, calendar functions, and medication management). Factors that could discourage participation were particularly related to the time it would take every day. The biggest motivations for participation were to contribute to research in MS, to learn more about one's own MS and what affects it, and to be able to exchange experiences with other people with MS. MS causes limitations that put demands on tools developed for digital data collection. A digital data collection tool can increase chances of high adoption rates, but it needs to be supplemented with a clear and simple project design and continuous communication with participants. Motivational factors should be considered in both study design and the development of a digital data collection tool for research.","Journal Article","10.2196/13295",NA,"PubMed"

Objective: To assess walking, grasping, cognitive dysfunctions and fatigue in early diagnosed PwMS. Methods: A total of 80 PwMS with EDSS<=2.5 and disease duration <=5 years were recruited and assessed using clinical scales and wearable sensors. Results: The mean(±standard deviation) EDSS score was 1.5±0.7 while disease duration was 3.2±1.8 years. 89% of PwMS had abnormal scores on the Six Minute Walking Test (6MWT) compared with normative data, similarly 54% had impaired balance on the Fullerton Advanced Balance Scale. These data were confirmed by instrumented assessment of body sway area accelerations that were 5 times larger for PwMS (1.1± 2.7mm2/s4) compared to healthy subjects (0.2±0.2mm2/s4, p=0.002 at Mann-Whitney test). Fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale) was present in 25% of the sample and was associated with increased step asymmetry at the end of the 6MWT(from -0.67±0.18[unitless] to -0.65±1.19, p<0.03 at repeated ANOVA test). Almost 1/3 of the sample showed impaired hand dexterity on the Nine-Hole Peg Test while no relevant cognitive dysfunctions were present, with only 4 to 9% of abnormal scores on Brief International Cognitive Assessment For Multiple Sclerosis subscales. Multivariate analysis showed that only fatigue was associated with participation restrictions and perceived walking disability measured by the measured by the Community integration Questionnaire and the MS walking scale, respectively. Conclusion: This study showed high frequency of walking and balance abnormalities even in early diagnosed PwMS while upper limb dysfunctions and fatigue were less frequent. However, only fatigue was associated with increased participation restrictions and perceived walking disturbances. In the following months the follow up assessment will provide information on the progression of functional decline, if any.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458519844447","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458519844447&atitle=Identification+of+functional+disorders+in+early+diagnosed+People+with+Multiple+Sclerosis%3A+A+window+of+opportunity%3F&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=25&issue=7&spage=1047&epage=1048&aulast=Gervasoni&aufirst=E.&auinit=E.&aufull=Gervasoni+E.&coden=&isbn=&pages=1047-1048&date=2019&auinit1=E&auinitm=","Embase"

Objectives: We hypothesized that aggregating data from two simple smartphone tests of fine finger movements with differing contribution of specific neurological domains (i.e., strength & cerebellar functions, vision and reaction time) will allow establishment of secondary outcomes that reflect domain-specific deficit. This hypothesis was tested by assessing correlations of smartphone-derived outcomes with relevant parts of neurological examination in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Methods: We developed MS test suite on Android platform, consisting of several simple functional tests. This paper compares cross-sectional and longitudinal performance of Finger tapping and Balloon popping tests by 76 MS patients and 19 healthy volunteers (HV). Results: The primary outcomes of smartphone tests, the average number of taps (per two 10-second intervals) and the average number of pops (per two 26-second intervals) differentiated MS from HV with similar power to traditional, investigator-administered test of fine finger movements, 9-hole peg test (9HPT). Additionally, the secondary outcomes identified patients with predominant cerebellar dysfunction, motor fatigue and poor eyehand coordination and/or reaction time, as evidenced by significant correlations between these derived outcomes and relevant parts of neurological examination. The intra-individual variance in longitudinal sampling was low. Conclusion: In the time necessary for performing 9HPT, smartphone tests provide much richer and reliable measurements of several distinct neurological functions. These data suggest that combing more creatively-construed smartphone apps may one day recreate the entire neurological examination.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458519843084","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458519843084&atitle=Identifying+and+quantifying+neurological+disability+via+smartphone+app&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=25&issue=&spage=36&epage=37&aulast=Boukhvalova&aufirst=Alexandra&auinit=A.&aufull=Boukhvalova+A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=36-37&date=2019&auinit1=A&auinitm=","Embase"

By combining two-photon imaging and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the most widely used rodent model of multiple sclerosis (MS), it has been possible, for example, to study how axons degenerate when confronted with inflammatory cells, how oligodendrocytes get damaged in inflammatory lesions, and how immune cells themselves adapt their phenotype and functionality to the changing lesion environment. Similar approaches are now increasingly used to study other forms of neuroinflammation, such as antibody/complement-mediated neuromyelitis optica spectrum disease (NMOSD). To tackle the most pressing open questions in the field, new biosensors and indicator mice that report the metabolic state and interaction of cells in neuroinflammatory lesions are being developed. Moreover, the field is moving towards new anatomical sites of inflammation, such as the cortical gray matter, but also towards longer observation intervals to reveal the chronic perturbations and adaptations that characterize advanced stages of MS.","Review","10.1016/J.EXPNEUROL.2019.112968","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=10902430&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.expneurol.2019.112968&atitle=Imaging+the+execution+phase+of+neuroinflammatory+disease+models&stitle=Exp.+Neurol.&title=Experimental+Neurology&volume=320&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Schumacher&aufirst=Adrian-Minh&auinit=A.-M.&aufull=Schumacher+A.-M.&coden=EXNEA&isbn=&pages=-&date=2019&auinit1=A&auinitm=-M","Embase"

Background: Teleneurology has been well described for acute stroke but its outpatient use has been limited. In particular, there are few studies assessing personal use video-conferencing platforms in neurology. At home virtual visits have the potential to improve patient access to neurological subspecialty care which otherwise often requires travel. Travel may be difficult for patients due to expense and disability. There is a need for improved access to quality neurological care. Design/Methods: All adult patients completing virtual neurologic follow-up visits from a single tertiary care institution over a four year period were included. Virtual visits were conducted by personal smartphone or computer via video-conferencing with a provider. Patients were asked to rate their overall experience with the visit and provider (5 point scale). Travel distance from the institution was calculated using patient's home address. Results: 3958 patients completed 5646 virtual visits during the four year period. Virtual visits were completed in all outpatient subspecialities with breakdown as follows: Headache 21.4%, Epilepsy 19.1%, Spine 15.7%, Movement 10.8%, Psychiatry 6.4%, Autonomic 5.7%, Cerebrovascular 4.8%, Cognitive 3.6%, and the remainder being <3.5%. 29.8% of patients were local (<50 miles), 25.9% were near regional (50-150 miles), 21.6% were far regional (151-270 miles), and 23.1% were remote (>270 miles). Across the 5646 visits, 1,418,688 miles of travel was prevented. Number of virtual visits increased from 30 visits year 1 to 4514 year 4. 25.1% of patients completed multiple virtual visits. On average, patients rated their overall experience with the virtual visit 4.7/5 and rated their provider 4.9/5. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the feasibility of implementing subspecialty teleneurology services and high patient ratings for these services. Future efforts should focus on demonstrating value for patients and the health care system.","Conference Abstract",NA,"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=1526632X&id=doi:&atitle=Implementation+and+patient+experience+with+outpatient+subspecialty+teleneurology+visits+at+a+single+academic+institution+over+four+years&stitle=Neurology&title=Neurology&volume=92&issue=15&spage=&epage=&aulast=Ross&aufirst=Lindsay&auinit=L.&aufull=Ross+L.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2019&auinit1=L&auinitm=","Embase"

Previous studies have shown that vibrotactile feedback (VTf) of trunk sway improves MS patients' balance control compared to training without VTf. Objectives: To determine how much VTf training is needed to obtain the best results with VTf. Moreover, we sought to investigate how long the carry-over benefit lasts once VTf training terminates and whether the benefit is similar for stance and gait tasks. Methods: We included 14 MS patients with balance deficits: 4 male, 3/14 progressive MS, mean age 53.8 ?± 7.5, disease duration 10.5?±12.6 years; median EDSS 3.0. Patients trained stance and gait tasks 2x per week with VTf for 4 weeks to determine when balance control with and without VTf no longer improved. The VTf thresholds were based on 90% ranges of trunk sway amplitudes and velocities for stance and gait tasks, respectively, measured before each week's training sessions. Patients were then assessed weekly without VTf for another 4 weeks and 6 months later to determine when retention of improvement ended. The difference in trunk sway between the very first assessment and subsequent assessments was used to measure improvement. Balance was measured with gyroscopes mounted at the lower trunk. The gyroscope signals drove directionally active VTf in a head-band. Results: VTf showed a 25% decrease in a global combined balance control index (BCI) of all tasks and measures (p< 0.004) for each of the 4 weeks of VTf training. The improvement was to within the range of healthy controls, and slightly less significant without VTf (p< 0.01). After cessation of training, the BCI showed an average 21% carry-over effect each week (p< 0.02) lasting over 1 month. At 6 months the carry-over effect was not present anymore. Improvement was present for both stance and gait tasks. For example, VTf improved trunk roll by 26% during walking with head extension-flexion movements (p< 0.02) and increased gait speed (30%) without an increase in trunk sway velocity. Conclusions: VTf training yields clinically relevant reductions (to within normal limits) in sway during stance and gait, and improved gait speed. This research provides guidelines for the practical application of VTf for improved balance control in MS patients. The reduction of retained improvement 2-6 months after training is an estimate of the time when patients need to return to the clinic to receive VTf training again, but needs precise definition.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458519868081","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13524585&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458519868081&atitle=Improvements+in+balance+control+for+multiple+sclerosis+patients+with+vibro-tactile+biofeedback+of+trunk+sway&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=25&issue=&spage=803&epage=804&aulast=Allum&aufirst=J.&auinit=J.&aufull=Allum+J.&coden=&isbn=&pages=803-804&date=2019&auinit1=J&auinitm=","Embase"

Methods This two-phase study recruited online research network members reporting MS and who were utilizing Fitbit One (TM) activity trackers. In the first phase, participant interviews assessed demand based on physical activity and the use of behavior-change techniques. The second phase assessed the demand, limited efficacy, acceptability, and practicality of a Wearables 101 course that integrated behavior change and self-experimentation principles. Tracker data were used to determine the percent of matches between daily symptom-based step goals and step counts. Results Participants expressed demand in the form of interest in gaining insights about a possible sweet spot behavioral target, if a system could be produced to support that. Limited efficacy results were mixed, with approximately one-third of participants dropping out and only half matching their daily target goals for at least 50% of days. In terms of practicality, participants commented on the burden of daily measurement and the need for a longer baseline period. Participants noted that tracking helped support an understanding of the link between activities and symptom severity, suggesting acceptability. Conclusions Results suggested that the intervention demand and acceptability criteria were demonstrated more strongly than limited efficacy and practicality. The matching intervention tested in this study will require refinement in baseline measurement, goal definition, and reduced data-gathering burden. Such changes may improve efficacy and practicality requirements and, by extension, later impact of the intervention on MS outcomes. Overall, these results provide justification for additional work on refining the intervention to increase practicality and efficacy.","Article","10.1177/2055207619872077","WOS:000483763900001","WoS"

However, instrumental assessment is needed to provide quantitative measures. Objective: To develop and validate an instrumented version of the mDGI. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Clinical setting. Participants: Thirty adults with neurologic disorders (10 with multiple sclerosis, 10 with Parkinson disease, and 10 with stroke) and 20 healthy volunteers. Methods: Participants were assessed with the Timed Up and Go test (TUG) and with the mDGI. During the assessment of mDGI, data were collected by a single Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) positioned on the sternum. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the instrumented data extracting eight PC scores (ImPC) describing dynamic balance. The instrumented overall score (ImDGI) was then calculated as the sum of the mPCs. PCA revealed two components associated with stride features and regularity (ImDGI_Gait_Pattern) and trunk movements (ImDGI_Trunk_Sway). Spearman coefficients were calculated between mDGI and ImDGI, whereas Mann-Whitney (U) and Kruskal-Wallis (H) tests assessed differences between groups and neurologic conditions. Main Outcome Measurements: ImDGI. Results: ImDGI did not show ceiling effects, and good correlations were found between ImDGI and mDGI (r =.84), and TUG (r =.84) for people with neurologic disorders (P <.001). Significant differences among pathologies (H test((2))=12.5, P =.002) and between healthy participants and adults with neurologic disorders (U test = 47.0, P =.001) were found. ImDGI_Trunk_Sway discriminated between people using or not using walking aids and among the three pathologies (H((2)) = 10.0, P =.007).

Different technological approaches exist, ranging from wearable sensors to 3D cameras using visual perceptive computing (VPC). In the literature, five independent domains of gait (pace, rhythm, asymmetry, variability, postural control) were presented for older adults. Here, said domains are investigated in PwMS and healthy controls (HC). Objective: 1) To identify kinematic parameters from two technologies to describe independent gait domains and 2) to analyse said gait domains in PwMS and HC. Methods: In total, 19 PwMS (f=11, age: 33-65, EDSS: 1-6) and 33 HC (f=17, age: 22-80) were recorded using a VPC system (Motognosis Labs) during performance of 12 motor tasks, including stepping in place (SIP), 3m of comfortable and maximum speed walk (CSW, MSW) and stance task (POCO). Additionally, all subjects walked 7m back and forth (in CSW and MSW) while wearing inertial sensors (Mobility Lab - MoL). Derived kinematics were grouped into the five gait domains. Inter-system correlation (Pearson's r) in HC was used to identify parameters with high agreement, while intra-system r was used to identify redundancies. Groups were compared using independent t-tests (p) and Cohen's D (ES). Results: Both systems provided similar kinematics including gait speed, stride length and step durations covering all gait domains. SIP asymmetry and POCO sway range were added from VPC for further input on asymmetry and postural control domain. Moderate to large differences between PwMS and HC were found for all domains, most prominent in the pace domain, where PwMS showed lower speed during MSW (MoL: p=.001, ES=-1.09; VPC: p=0.001, ES=-1.13). Reduced speed was also observed in CSW (MoL: p=.013, ES =-.77; VPC: p=.011, ES = -.79). Inter-domain correlation revealed a higher dependency between domains in PwMS as compared to HC. Conclusion: Despite technological limitations of both systems, we derived meaningful parameter sets for VPC and MoL with respect to the 5 gait domains. Results from groupwise comparisons indicate that selected parameters reflect differences in all gait domains in PwMS. Furthermore, inter-domain correlations suggest that the domains are less distinct in PwMS possibly due to larger variance in cohort.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458519868080","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13524585&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458519868080&atitle=Investigating+independent+gait+domains+in+patients+with+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=25&issue=&spage=813&epage=814&aulast=Otte&aufirst=K.&auinit=K.&aufull=Otte+K.&coden=&isbn=&pages=813-814&date=2019&auinit1=K&auinitm=","Embase"

Nonetheless, it is not clear how IMU-based metrics might be influenced by pragmatic aspects associated with clinical translation of this approach, such as data collection settings and gait protocols. In this study, we hypothesised that these aspects do not significantly alter those characteristics of gait that are more related to quality and energetic efficiency and are quantifiable via acceleration related metrics, such as intensity, smoothness, stability, symmetry, and regularity. To test this hypothesis, we compared 33 IMU-based metrics extracted from data, retrospectively collected by two independent centres on two matched cohorts of pwMS. As a worst-case scenario, a walking test was performed in the two centres at a different speed along corridors of different lengths, using different IMU systems, which were also positioned differently. The results showed that the majority of the temporal metrics (9 out of 12) exhibited significant between-centre differences. Conversely, the between-centre differences in the gait quality metrics were small and comparable to those associated with a test-retest analysis under equivalent conditions. Therefore, the gait quality metrics are promising candidates for reliable multi-centric studies aiming at assessing rehabilitation interventions within a routine clinical context.","Article","10.3390/S20010079","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14248220&id=doi:10.3390%2Fs20010079&atitle=Is+a+Wearable+Sensor-Based+Characterisation+of+Gait+Robust+Enough+to+Overcome+Differences+Between+Measurement+Protocols%3F+A+Multi-Centric+Pragmatic+Study+in+Patients+with+Multiple+Sclerosis&stitle=Sensors+%28Basel%29&title=Sensors+%28Basel%2C+Switzerland%29&volume=20&issue=1&spage=&epage=&aulast=Angelini&aufirst=Lorenza&auinit=L.&aufull=Angelini+L.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2019&auinit1=L&auinitm=","Embase"

While in most healthy adults, this ability can be assumed as given, limitations in walking ability occur with increasing age. Furthermore, slow walking speed is linked to several chronic conditions and overall morbidity. Measurements of gait parameters can be used as a proxy to detect functional decline and onset of chronic conditions. Up to now, gait characteristics used for this purpose are measured in standardized laboratory settings. There is some evidence, however, that long-term measurements of gait parameters in the living environment have some advantages over short-term laboratory measurements. Methods We evaluated cross-sectional data from an accelerometric sensor worn in a subgroup of 554 participants of the Berlin Aging Study II (BASE-II). Data from the two BASE-II age groups (age between 22–36 years and 60–79 years) were used for the current analysis of accelerometric data for a minimum of two days and a maximum of ten days were available. Real world walking speed, number of steps, maximum coherent distance and total distance were derived as average data per day. Linear regression analyses were performed on the different gait parameters in order to identify significant determinants. Additionally, Mann-Whitney-U-tests were performed to detect sex-specific differences. Results Age showed to be significantly associated with real world walking speed and with the total distance covered per day, while BMI contributed negatively to the number of walking steps, maximum coherent distance and total distance walked. Additionally, sex was associated with walking steps. However, R(2)-values for all models were low. Overall, women had significantly more walking steps and a larger coherent distance per day when compared to men. When separated by age group, this difference was significant only in the older participants. Additionally, walking speed was significantly higher in women compared to men in the subgroup of older people. Conclusions Age- and sex-specific differences have to be considered when objective gait parameters are measured, e.g. in the context of clinical risk assessment. For this purpose normative data, differentiating for age and sex would have to be established to allow reliable classification of long-term measurements of gait.","Article","10.1371/JOURNAL.PONE.0225026","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=19326203&id=doi:10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0225026&atitle=Long-term+gait+measurements+in+daily+life%3A+Results+from+the+Berlin+Aging+Study+II+%28BASE-II%29&stitle=PLoS+ONE&title=PLoS+ONE&volume=14&issue=12&spage=&epage=&aulast=Kiselev&aufirst=J%C3%B6rn&auinit=J.&aufull=Kiselev+J.&coden=POLNC&isbn=&pages=-&date=2019&auinit1=J&auinitm=","Embase"

Patient reported outcomes (PROs) and digital functional measures (computerized cognitive testing, simulated driving testing, etc.) are emerging as more meaningful, patient-centered measures. As patient-tracking sources expand beyond what is traditionally captured in an office visit to wearables and apps, clinicians need tools to help integrate these varied streams of data. Machine learning has the potential to help clinicians predict meaningful patient (pt) outcomes from near-unlimited data sources. Objectives: To use standard machine learning methods on an MS Center's dataset of computerized cognitive assessments, PROs, DMT choice and electronic medical records (EMR) to predict clinical outcomes. Aims: To demonstrate the feasibility of predicting the trajectory of MS outcomes using standard machine learning methods of deidentified data from a national network of clinical sites. Methods: A dataset (EMR data, cognitive domain scores and PROs) from 258 MS pts (72.5% female, mean age of 46.2±10.2 years) over a three year period at a single MS Center was constructed. .80% of the dataset was used in training and 20% in testing. An ensemble learning method (random forest classifiers) was used to construct a multitude of decision trees at training time, which then outputted the class that is the mean prediction of the individual trees. Results: Untuned models calculated F1 scores (2∗[Precision ∗Recall]/[Precision+Recall]), Precision, Recall and Accuracy for multiple models predicting PROs and DMT choice. The most precise and accurate models were for the driving PRO (0.913, 0.904, 0.942, 0.912) and the Morse Fall Scale (0.789, 0.796, 0.792, 0.829). Results from the other models had lower F1 scores, Precision, Recall and Accuracy. Conclusions: Preliminary results already suggest that machine learning can be used to predict patients at risk for driving difficulties and for falls. The results of the other models demonstrate the feasibility of using machine learning in a broader network of clinical sites that will allow for greater accuracy, precision and recall. The eventual goal is that these models can be used as an aid in the shared decision making process, and to reduce inappropriate healthcare costs.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458519868078","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13524585&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458519868078&atitle=Machine+learning+models+using+multi-dimensional+digital+data+and+PROs+predict+driving+difficulties+and+falls+in+people+with+MS&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=25&issue=&spage=342&epage=343&aulast=Gudesblatt&aufirst=M.&auinit=M.&aufull=Gudesblatt+M.&coden=&isbn=&pages=342-343&date=2019&auinit1=M&auinitm=","Embase"

Real-time monitoring of SMEnzyme is also crucial as an important biomarker for several other diseases like atherosclerosis, multiple sclerosis, and HIV. In this study, we present an electrochemical method to detect SMEnzyme concentration that is more sensitive and much faster than currently available commercial assays. For detection and the amplification of the SMEnzyme signal, methylene blue (MB)-encapsulated sphingomyelin (SM)-based liposome with 50% cholesterol was synthesized via sonication method. Then the target SMEnzyme causes the free release of the MB from the MB-liposome formulation which can be detected on GCE parallel to Au-PAni/N,S-GQDs electrode, prepared via interfacial polymerization and then self-assembly approach. The change of SM to gel state bilayer with increasing concentration of ceramide accounts for the observed increase in membrane permeability and consequent release of encapsulated MB as the redox indicator for electrochemical Differential Pulse Voltammetric (DPV) analysis. To get the optimum capture through pi-pi stacking interaction of the released MB on the Au-PAni/N,S-GQDs nanocomposites, which has been used as working electrode. Minimal cross-reactivity with similar phospholipase and proteins confirms the stable and non-leaky MB-liposome platform with low background signal and high specificity toward SMEnzyme. Additionally, the applicability of the proposed sensor has successfully verified in three possible sources of human serum, plasma and cell supernatant without compromising its performance. Taken together, the simplicity, rapid response time and high sensitivity of this present method offer huge potential in point-of-care diagnostics of SMEnzyme detection.","Article","10.1016/J.SNB.2019.127153","WOS:000489529300059","WoS"

Currently, there are no best practice guidelines for upper extremity rehabilitation and there is an important need to investigate how people with MS navigate hand dysfunction from the patient's perspective. Objective: To use a mixed methods research design to explore how individuals manage MS-related symptoms of their hand. Methods: In-depth qualitative interviews combined with upper extremity assessment (Nine Hole Peg Test (NHPT)) and measures of hand movement in the community (bilateral accelerometers for 24 hours) were used. Results: Eleven participants (8 F, M = 50.91, SD =13.69 yrs) with self-reported upper extremity dysfunction were recruited. For NHPT, two participants scored in the severe impairment range (< 33.3 s) and nine scored in the mild impairment range (18 - 33.3 s). Of the nine within the mild range, eight participants discussed significant hand dysfunction limiting independence. Accelerometry showed that two participants displayed asymmetrical plots (greater use of unaffected hand). One of the two participants had a severe NHPT score. Seven participants in the mild impairment NHPT range had symmetrical, low magnitude hand movements. The accelerometry outputs aligned with participants' accounts of developing strategies to complete tasks with both hands or avoiding tasks altogether. From the interviews, two themes emerged: (1) self-learned compensation, and (2) priority of lower versus upper extremity. For the theme 'learned compensation', participants spoke to responding to their physical limitations by developing strategies to help them live independently. For example, “If I do have little tiny things to pick up, I'll get a pair of pliers so I can open things.” (NHPT affected hand: 38 s (severe), Accelerometry plots: NA). The second theme, 'prioritizing the lower extremity', was described by most participants. For example, “We mostly focus on the leg for dropped foot. I haven't done anything for the hand.” (NHPT affected hand: 37 s (severe), Accelerometry plots: asymmetrical, low magnitude). Conclusion: Most patients did not receive rehabilitation for the management of their upper extremity symptoms. They described creating their own compensatory strategies to perform tasks which was detected using bilateral accelerometry. NHPT data did not align with the qualitative data, exposing a need for greater sensitivity of measurement tools.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458519868078","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13524585&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458519868078&atitle=Mixed+methods+study+of+the+upper+extremity%3A+Forgotten+and+not+prioritized+in+MS+rehabilitation&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=25&issue=&spage=354&epage=&aulast=Wadden&aufirst=K.&auinit=K.&aufull=Wadden+K.&coden=&isbn=&pages=354-&date=2019&auinit1=K&auinitm=","Embase"

There are a wide range of symptoms, with fatigue reported as one of the most troublesome. MS Energize—or MS Energise in UK English regions—is an iPhone app focused on self-management of fatigue for people with MS. Based on cognitive-behavioral therapy principles, the app covers MS fatigue, how to use energy effectively, how behavior, thoughts and emotions interact and impact on MS fatigue, as well as the potential effects of bodily and environmental factors. MS Energize provides education, interactive tasks, and supports application of the principles into a user's day-to-day life.

Participants used the app over a period of five to six weeks after which they rated the usability of the app and participated in an in-depth qualitative interview. We developed four main themes through our thematic analysis. 1. Validation of participants' own experiences of living with MS fatigue. 2. The personal cost in engaging with such an intervention. 3. Reframing experiences and adding to knowledge. 4. That the app was generally a good idea. Field testers' feedback also identified usability issues that could be addressed. In particular, the amount of text-based content in the app contributed to the app itself being fatiguing.

McCully et al. have developed novel approaches to measuring muscle endurance using accelerometer-based mechanomyography (aMMG) and mitochondrial capacity using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Backus et al. have demonstrated impaired muscle endurance and mitochondrial capacity, as well as improvements in these outcomes following rehabilitation interventions, in PwMS. NIRS and aMMG can be available to clinicians, and might provide information that can be used to guide selection of rehabilitation interventions for PwMS.

People with moderate to severe disability (EDSS=5.0-6.5) had reduced mitochondrial capacity and endurance, and walking ability compared to people with mild disability (EDSS=2.5-4.5). Study 2: MG mitochondrial capacity was lower in PwMS (n=16) compared to controls (n=9) (p<0.05). PwMS who used assistive devices tended to have lower mitochondrial capacity in the weaker leg (p=0.07). Study 3: MG mitochondrial capacity increased by 68.2% and muscle endurance increased an average 18.5% in PwMS (n=6) that performed sixteen sessions of antigravity treadmill training. There were no significant improvements in walking function (2MWT). Study 4: quadricep mitochondrial capacity increased an average 47% (p = 0.05) in PwMS (n=8) that performed four weeks of functional electrical stimulation cycling. Conclusion: Measuring muscle function has the potential to change how MS in managed in the future, which may lead to meaningful improvements in function in PwMS.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458519843084","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458519843084&atitle=Muscle+dysfunction+and+measurement%3A+A+potential+biomarker+for+precision+rehabilitation+in+PWMS&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=25&issue=&spage=27&epage=&aulast=Backus&aufirst=Deborah&auinit=D.&aufull=Backus+D.&coden=&isbn=&pages=27-&date=2019&auinit1=D&auinitm=","Embase"

A pilot study was conducted using myMS, a comprehensive smartphone application, to compare its active tasks against clinical metrics traditionally used in MS. Background: Digital health products offer a new data collection strategy and personalized disease management tools. They are gradually winning out on accessibility, efficiency, accuracy and cost effectiveness compared to traditional data collection methods for complex diseases like MS where patients experience daily fluctuating symptoms. Since this technology is scalable, it can allow the collection of a high-quality BigData set worldwide. Design/Methods: myMS uses a comprehensive approach to collect clinical (ambulation, cognition, vision, QOL, Rx, diet, MS and childhood history, exercise habits, comorbidities), genetic (∼1,000,000 SNPs, FDA-approved 23 and Me reports), and MRI (visualization and quantification) data that could interface with wearable devices (iPhone or Android). The pilot study included 200 U.S. participants who used myMS and a sub-study (n=75) conveniently sampled at USC to compare its active tasks (6Mapp, COGapp, VISapp) against EDSS, T25FW, Symbol-Digit-Modality-Test (SDMT), and low contrast visual acuity (LCVA). Results: After uploading MRI images on a dedicated website, 200 participants completed enrollment from home and met inclusion criteria based on MRI dissemination in time. Participants were able to register and receive 23 and Me genetic kits at home and complete surveys and active tasks. Cross-sectional Spearman correlation analysis showed modest to strong correlation (p<0.01) between 6Mapp-25FWT (r=-0.85); 6Mapp-EDSS (r=-0.31); COGapp-SDMT (r=0.69); and VISapp-LCVA (r=0.67). Conclusions: myMS can be used successfully outside of clinical visits with minimal supervision and instructions. Frequent notifications, personalized dashboard, and incentives such as genetic reports and browsing of MRI images increase participation and adherence. 6Mapp, COGapp, VISapp were significantly correlated with EDSS, 25FWT, SDMT, and LCVA, providing preliminary validation of myMS.","Conference Abstract",NA,"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=1526632X&id=doi:&atitle=MYMS%3B+a+comprehensive+patient-centered+mobile+app+to+monitor+ms+at+home&stitle=Neurology&title=Neurology&volume=92&issue=15&spage=&epage=&aulast=Pelletier&aufirst=Daniel&auinit=D.&aufull=Pelletier+D.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2019&auinit1=D&auinitm=","Embase"

Walking is traditionally quantified with various measures, including patient self-reports, clinical rating scales, performance measures, and advanced lab-based movement analysis techniques. Yet, the majority of these measures do not fully characterize walking (i.e., gait quality) nor adequately reflect walking in the real world (i.e., community ambulation) and have limited timescale (only measure walking at a single point in time). We discuss the potential of wearable sensors to provide sensitive, objective, and easy-to-use assessment of community ambulation in PwMS. Recent Findings: Wearable technology has the ability to measure all aspects of gait in PwMS yet is under-studied in comparison with other populations (e.g., older adults). Within the studies focusing on PwMS, half that measure pace collected free-living data, while only one study explored gait variability in free-living conditions. No studies explore gait asymmetry or complexity in free-living conditions. Summary: Wearable technology has the ability to provide objective, comprehensive, and sensitive measures of gait in PwMS. Future research should investigate this technology’s ability to accurately assess free-living measures of gait quality, specifically gait asymmetry and complexity.","Review","10.1007/S11910-019-0997-9","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=15346293&id=doi:10.1007%2Fs11910-019-0997-9&atitle=Next+Steps+in+Wearable+Technology+and+Community+Ambulation+in+Multiple+Sclerosis&stitle=Curr.+Neurol.+Neurosci.+Rep.&title=Current+Neurology+and+Neuroscience+Reports&volume=19&issue=10&spage=&epage=&aulast=Frechette&aufirst=Mikaela+L.&auinit=M.L.&aufull=Frechette+M.L.&coden=CNNRB&isbn=&pages=-&date=2019&auinit1=M&auinitm=L","Embase"

We demonstrate how smartphone tests can differentiate MS without ON, MS with prior ON history and normal subjects in a clinic setting that can provide accessible standardized testing to neurology and ophthalmology clinics. Methods: In this pilot study, 117 patients with MS (relapse remitting MS and secondary progressive MS) with prior optic neuritis (MS+ON; n=43) or without prior optic neuritis (MS-ON; n=74) and 104 age-matched controls were tested in the Aalborg, Denmark University Hospital Multiple Sclerosis Clinic using a battery of smartphone visual function tests (Landolt C acuity, Landolt C contrast sensitivity, critical flicker fusion contrast threshold at 7.5, 15, and 30 Hz, related to visual conduction speed). Testing was performed with the patient wearing their glasses. One eye was used for statistical comparisons between groups (ANOVA rank test with pairwise multiple comparisons using Dunn's method). Results: Each smartphone test took approximately 15 seconds to complete and was intuitive enough that patients were able to immediately perform the visual task. Contrast at which 15 and 30 Hz critical flicker fusion occurred provided the greatest separation between MS patients and normal subjects, with or without prior optic neuritis. Conclusions: Portable and rapid smartphone tests of visual function, specifically visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and flicker sensitivity, can give valuable information about the function of the afferent visual system, which could help in the triage and monitoring of patients with MS and patients with other vision threatening disorders. Interestingly, smartphone flicker sensitivity, a test of visual speed of conduction, provided the greatest discrimination between eyes of MS patients with or without a previous diagnosis of optic neuritis compared to normal eyes. This finding motivates the importance of using a behavioral visual test of visual conduction speed, such as critical flicker fusion or flicker sensitivity, which is resistant to optical blur, to monitor various causes of visual dysfunction.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458519868081","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13524585&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458519868081&atitle=Objective+smartphone+vision+tests+to+characterize+visual+function+in+multiple+sclerosis+patients+with+and+without+optic+neuritis&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=25&issue=&spage=643&epage=644&aulast=Zarei&aufirst=K.&auinit=K.&aufull=Zarei+K.&coden=&isbn=&pages=643-644&date=2019&auinit1=K&auinitm=","Embase"

Technological advances in biomechanics offer objective assessments of gait disabilities. Here we employed wearable sensors to measure electromyography(EMG)and body acceleration during walking and to quantify the altered gait pattern between patients with MS and healthy controls. Methods: Forty patients with MS (PwMS, mean EDSS: 5.51 ± 1)and 15 healthy controls were enrolled. Ten-meter-walking-test (10MWT)was performed with accelerators attached on the waist and electrodes (BTS bioengineering, Italy)attached on bilateral thighs (Rectus and Biceps Femoris, RF-BF)and legs (Tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius, TA-GM)for measuring body acceleration and EMG recording. The tests were performed with shoes and socks. Time, Cadence (pace/min), step length and Coactivation index (CoI)between antagonistic pairs were calculated for more and less affected side (MA/LA)for statistics. Results: PwMS showed longer time, lower cadence, and shorter step length in both conditions than controls. Increased coactivation than controls was found in RF-BF on both sides, while only in MA of TA-GM. PwMS walked better (shorter time, higher cadence, longer step length)when wearing shoes. Higher CoI of RF-BF on MA side positively correlated with 10MWT time (r = 0.5), EDSS (r = 0.4), and negatively correlated with cadence (r = −0.6). Conclusion: The results quantified the altered walking pattern in PwMS, the situation worsen when walking in barefoot. Further, increased coactivation was found in both the proximal (RF-BF)and distal (TA-GM)levels and correlated with higher EDSS and worse spatial-temporal parameters.

Technological advances in biomechanics offer opportunities to assess the effects of rehabilitation objectively. Here we employed wearable sensors to measure electromyography (EMG)and body acceleration during walking and to evaluate the changes in walking pattern after rehabilitation. Methods: Forty patients with MS (PwMS, mean EDSS: 5.51 ± 1)were enrolled. Ten-meter-walking-test (10MWT)were performed before and after rehabilitation. Clinical symptoms were assessed with self-reported questionnaires. An accelerator attached on the waist and 8 electrodes (BTS bioengineering, Italy)attached on bilateral thighs (Rectus and Biceps Femoris, RF-BF)and legs (Tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius, TA-GM)for measuring body acceleration and EMG recording. Time, cadence (pace/minutes), step-length and coactivation index(CoI)between antagonistic pairs pre- and post-rehabilitation were calculated on more and less affected side (MA/LA)for statistics. Results: The time (p < 0.001)and cadence (p = 0.01)of 10MWT were significantly improved after rehabilitation. Though not statistically significant, CoI of RF-BF reduced in both sides post treatment (MA pre: 22.51 ± 10.10 v.s. post: 18.72 ± 7.14; LA pre: 20.35 ± 7.34 v.s. post: 17.45 ± 4.64). Further, reduced CoI of RF-BF pair on MA side correlated with less walking time in 10MWT (r = 0.43), while the reduction on LA sides correlated with less fatigue (r = 0.38, fatigue evaluated with Fatigue Severity Scale). Discussion: Our results showed that the improvements of walking capacity after rehabilitation in PwMS may be related to reduced coactivation of the distal muscle. Combining objective assessments of EMG and accelerators allows us to better evaluate the effects of rehabilitation of gait and may benefit in future personalized rehabilitation program.","Conference Abstract","10.1016/J.CLINPH.2019.04.574","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=18728952&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.clinph.2019.04.574&atitle=P38-S+Evaluating+effects+of+neurorehabilitation+on+gait+pattern+in+multiple+sclerosis+with+kinetic+and+electromyographic+analyses&stitle=Clin.+Neurophysiol.&title=Clinical+Neurophysiology&volume=130&issue=7&spage=e105&epage=&aulast=Huang&aufirst=Su-Chun&auinit=S.-C.&aufull=Huang+S.-C.&coden=&isbn=&pages=e105-&date=2019&auinit1=S&auinitm=-C","Embase"

Despite the importance of longitudinal follow up of these metrics, we remain reliant on the neurologic exam which is subjective, semi-quantitative, and not consistently reproducible. In contrast, clinical trials often rely on quantitative assessments of subjects every 3-6 months through a number of metrics, including the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) which is the current the gold standard of metrics for MS. Because the EDSS is heavily weighted towards ambulation, it does not successfully reflect the overall neurologic status in an individual. Objectives: 1) To assess the accuracy and precision of the BeCareLink App in quantifying cognitive, sensory and motor function in patients with MS and healthy controls. 2) Relate appderived measures with those from clinician-derived gold-standard tests, including the symbol digit modality test, PASAT, EDSS, Timed Up and Go test (TUG), timed 25-foot walk, and low contrast visual acuity. Methods: Patients and healthy controls were evaluated by expert raters with standard clinical metrics of neurologic function. Mobile app activities were performed by patients in the clinic. Results: Our analysis focused on the two motion-based activities most similar to the standardized tests: 25-foot walk and TUG. Observed average time for the 25-foot walk was 6.85 seconds while the average time tracked by the mobile app was 6.94 seconds. A regression model predicting lab time from app data produced a R-squared >99% with the difference in results having a SD of <0.54 seconds. The TUG comparison had similar results with a R-squared of 97% with a SD of the difference <2.3 seconds, indicating that a mobile app can acquire motion data using only the accelerometer and gyroscope with a similar accuracy to a trained professional using a stopwatch. Conclusion: The BeCareLink App produces scores that correlate closely with expert-administered tests in multiple outcome measures. With a user-friendly interface which is easily used by patients to acquire reliable quantitative data in a real-world setting, the App has great potential utility to monitor for clinical stability, improvement or progression. Further, the App could be used in clinical trials to acquire significantly more information at more frequent intervals with marked cost reduction.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458519843084","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458519843084&atitle=Patient+centered+outcomes+analysis+for+multiple+sclerosis+using+a+mobile+application&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=25&issue=&spage=112&epage=&aulast=Rubin&aufirst=Lawrence&auinit=L.&aufull=Rubin+L.&coden=&isbn=&pages=112-&date=2019&auinit1=L&auinitm=","Embase"

To date, this relationship has been predominantly examined in young and middle-aged adults rather than in the rapidly-growing population of older adults with MS who often times have greater walking problems and are less physically active. This study examined whether physical activity was differentially associated with walking performance across three age groups of young (20–39 years), middle-aged (40–59 years), and older (60–79 years) adults with MS. Methods: The sample included 124 persons with MS who attended one testing session and provided demographic information, completed the Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW) and the Six Minute Walk (6MW) as measures of walking speed and walking endurance, respectively, and wore an accelerometer for a 7-day period. Results: Trend analysis indicated light physical activity did not significantly differ with increasing age; however, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), walking speed, and walking endurance declined with increasing age. Partial spearman's rank-order correlations between physical activity and walking outcomes that controlled for disease duration, race, and ambulatory disability within each age group indicated that the relationship between MVPA and walking performance was strong among older adults with MS (pr(s) for MVPA and T25FW: young = –0.01, middle-aged = –0.16, older = –0.63*; pr(s) for MVPA and 6MW: young = 0.10, middle-aged = 0.08, older = 0.68*).

Methods: 91 patients with multiple sclerosis were enrolled. Assessments included physical activity by 7-day thigh-worn accelerometry, knee extensor neuromuscular function by dynamometry (maximal isometric muscle strength, rate of force development (0-50 ms)), and physical function by 5× sit-to-stand, 2-min walk test, and timed 25 ft walk test. Physical activity tertile comparisons along with simple and multiple regressions (adjusting for age, gender, EDSS, time since diagnosis) were performed. Results: Physical activity tertiles revealed differences (p < 0.05) in maximal muscle strength (1.77 ≈ 1.97 < 2.28 Nm/kg), rate of force development (4.66 < 8.03 ≈ 10.55 Nm/kg/s), 5× sit-to-stand (11.4 ≈ 9.7 > 8.5 s), 2-min walk test (153 < 183 < 207 m), and timed 25 ft walk test (6.3 > 4.4 > 4.3 s). Moreover, physical activity was associated (p < 0.05) with maximal muscle strength and rate of force development (r2  =  0.13-0.15) along with 5× sit-to-stand, 2-min walk test, and timed 25 ft walk test (r2 = 0.18-0.24), also after adjusting for age + gender + EDSS + time since diagnosis (r2 = 0.25-0.37 and 0.24-0.52), with physical activity consistently being a strong predictor. Conclusions: Higher levels of physical activity are associated with greater neuromuscular and physical function in ambulatory patients with multiple sclerosis independent of disease severity. These findings emphasize the importance of performing regular physical activity at all stages of multiple sclerosis. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION Physical activity is associated with neuromuscular and physical function, independent of disease severity. Physical activity may be important in improving or preserving neuromuscular and physical function at all stages of ambulatory multiple sclerosis patients, yet longitudinal studies are warranted. Clinicians and rehabilitation professionals should encourage ambulatory patients at all stages of their disease to be as physically active as possible.","Article in Press","10.1080/09638288.2019.1634768","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14645165&id=doi:10.1080%2F09638288.2019.1634768&atitle=Physical+activity+is+associated+with+neuromuscular+and+physical+function+in+patients+with+multiple+sclerosis+independent+of+disease+severity&stitle=Disabil+Rehabil&title=Disability+and+rehabilitation&volume=&issue=&spage=1&epage=8&aulast=Rooney&aufirst=Scott&auinit=S.&aufull=Rooney+S.&coden=&isbn=&pages=1-8&date=2019&auinit1=S&auinitm=","Embase"

The objective of this study was to compare the physical activity of those with chronic diseases to healthy individuals using an objective measure of physical activity. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of data from 96 706 participants aged 40 years or older from the UK Biobank prospective cohort study (2006-10). Diagnoses were identified through ICD 9 and 10 coding within hospital admission records and a cancer registry linked to UK Biobank participants. We extracted summary physical activity information from participants who wore a wrist-worn triaxial accelerometer for 7 days. Statistical analyses included computation of adjusted geometric means and means using general linear models. Results: Participants with chronic disease undertook 9% or 61 minutes (95% confidence interval: 57.8-64.8) less moderate activity and 11% or 3 minutes (95% confidence interval: 2.7-3.3) less vigorous activity per week than individuals without chronic disease. Participants in every chronic-disease subgroup undertook less physical activity than those without chronic disease. Sixty-seven diagnoses within these subgroups were associated with lower moderate activity. Conclusions: The cross-sectional association of physical activity with chronic disease is broad. Given the substantial health benefits of being physically active, clinicians and policymakers should be aware that their patients with any chronic disease are at greater health risk from other diseases than anticipated because of their physical inactivity.","Article","10.1093/IJE/DYY294","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14643685&id=doi:10.1093%2Fije%2Fdyy294&atitle=Physical+activity+of+UK+adults+with+chronic+disease%3A+Cross-sectional+analysis+of+accelerometer-measured+physical+activity+in+96+706+UK+Biobank+participants&stitle=Int.+J.+Epidemiol.&title=International+Journal+of+Epidemiology&volume=48&issue=4&spage=1167&epage=1174&aulast=Barker&aufirst=Joseph&auinit=J.&aufull=Barker+J.&coden=IJEPB&isbn=&pages=1167-1174&date=2019&auinit1=J&auinitm=","Embase"

Sixty-six (26%) persons with MS had RLS (MS + RLS). There were no differences between the MS + RLS and MS group for parameters of physical activity or sedentary behavior. Among participants with IRLS scores in the mild range (n = 26), more time spent in light physical activity (r(s) = [sbnd]0.39), fewer sedentary bouts per day (r(s) = 0.55), less time in sedentary bouts per day (r(s) = 0.51), and fewer breaks in sedentary time per day (r(s) = 0.57) were associated with lower RLS severity. This study represents the first step toward recognizing a relationship between physical activity, patterns of sedentary behavior, and RLS severity in MS and these results suggest that light physical activity and the pattern of sedentary behavior may be important targets for prospective behavioral interventions that target the management of RLS in persons with MS who have mild RLS severity.","Article","10.1016/J.JNS.2019.116531","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=18785883&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.jns.2019.116531&atitle=Physical+activity%2C+sedentary+behavior%2C+and+restless+legs+syndrome+in+persons+with+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=J.+Neurol.+Sci.&title=Journal+of+the+Neurological+Sciences&volume=407&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Cederberg&aufirst=Katie+L.J.&auinit=K.L.J.&aufull=Cederberg+K.L.J.&coden=JNSCA&isbn=&pages=-&date=2019&auinit1=K&auinitm=L.J.","Embase"

However, the extent to which impairments in physical and cognitive functions are manifestations of MS and disease progression, reflective of the general aging process, or perhaps 2 detrimental processes exacerbating the synergistic effects of the other is relatively unknown. This study compared physical and cognitive functions, sedentary behavior, and physical activity between 40 older adults with MS (ie, 60 years of age and older) and 40 age- and sex-matched healthy older adults. We further examined whether physical activity and/or sedentary behavior explained differences between groups in physical and cognitive functions. METHODS: Participants initially underwent the cognitive assessments, followed by the physical function assessments. The order of tests was standardized and participants were provided seated-rest between the administrations of the physical function assessments. Participants were then instructed to wear an accelerometer and document wear time in a log book for a 7-day period after the testing session. RESULTS: Multivariate analyses of variance indicated that older adults with MS (n = 40) performed worse on all measures of physical function, and 1 measure of cognitive function (ie, information-processing speed), compared with healthy controls (n = 40). Older adults with MS engaged in less moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, more sedentary behavior, and longer duration of long sedentary bouts than healthy controls. Pearson correlations demonstrated that levels and patterns of physical activity were significantly associated with a majority of physical function variables but not cognitive function variables in both older adults with MS and healthy controls but to a greater extent in older adults with MS. Partial Pearson correlations further demonstrated that levels and patterns of sedentary behavior were significantly associated with a majority of physical function variables but not cognitive function variables primarily in older adults with MS. Linear regression analyses indicated that levels and patterns of physical activity and sedentary behavior partially accounted for differences in physical and cognitive function variables between older adults with MS and healthy controls. CONCLUSION: There is evidence of reduced function in older adults with MS, and this might be partially managed by behavioral interventions that target physical activity and sedentary behavior for the promotion of healthy aging in older adults with MS.","Article","10.1519/JPT.0000000000000163","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=21520895&id=doi:10.1519%2FJPT.0000000000000163&atitle=Physical+and+Cognitive+Functions%2C+Physical+Activity%2C+and+Sedentary+Behavior+in+Older+Adults+With+Multiple+Sclerosis&stitle=J+Geriatr+Phys+Ther&title=Journal+of+geriatric+physical+therapy+%282001%29&volume=42&issue=4&spage=304&epage=312&aulast=Bollaert&aufirst=Rachel+E.&auinit=R.E.&aufull=Bollaert+R.E.&coden=&isbn=&pages=304-312&date=2019&auinit1=R&auinitm=E","Embase"

In fact, based on this, new pathways of MS management and new approaches of interventions could supplement traditional therapeutic programmes. To pursue this goal, beside the Italian initiative PROMOPROMS on PRO and CAO, a devoted app, able to collect sensors data from smartphone registers and elaborate physical, cognitive and social variables, was developed and usertested and afterwards installed on the personal smartphone of 13 healthy subjects (HS; F=8) and 10 PwMS (F=7; RR=6, SP=4) for 1 month acquiring data 24hours/7days. All the participants were righthanded and the two groups were not significant different for age (HS: 43±6.62y; PwMS: 49±10.91y). HS were physically more active than PwMS as shown through an index taking into account all the motion sensors; differences were present in all the four considered 6-hour time slots (0-6h, HS: 796.83±329.03, PwMS: 9.65±16.74; 6-12h, HS: 7646.50±6949.62, PwMS: 721.18±1118.57; 13-18h, HS: 9860.20±7903.04, PwMS: 864.45±1139.95; 19-24h HS: 7948.89±7443.61, PwMS: 372.76±394.51; always p<0.05). The activity index was correlated with functional independence measured with FIM (Spearman rho=0.71, p<0.05). Moreover, each single smartphone use was significantly longer in PwMS (HS: 158.81±89.75s, PwMS: 469.51±479.99s; p<0.05) as deducible from the screen brightness time; cognitive decline in information processing could explain this results. Finally, PwMS significantly spent more time in incoming call (HS: 62.12±41.56s, PwMS: 188.87±203.53s; p<0.05), probably to face the withdrawal due to MS. Specific physical, cognitive and social profiles of PwMS seem to be detectable through an customized developed monitoring app. More definitive considerations need a larger sample to be evaluated, especially to provide also ad-hoc information for RR and SP patients.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458519844447","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458519844447&atitle=Physical%2C+cognitive+and+social+monitoring+towards+selfmanagement+delivery+in+patients+with+multiple+sclerosis+physical%2C+cognitive%2C+social+monitoring+in+MS&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=25&issue=7&spage=1059&epage=&aulast=Tacchino&aufirst=A.&auinit=A.&aufull=Tacchino+A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=1059-&date=2019&auinit1=A&auinitm=","Embase"

Methods: An informal literature search for evaluation studies was conducted (search terms: “visual analogue scale” and “equivalence” or “validation”). Combined with previously-identified publications, the results and conclusions of these studies were summarised qualitatively. Results: Nineteen published studies were included. All studies were crossover comparisons of paper to at least one form of electronic data collection. Studies varied in size from 12 to 355 subjects (median: 65 subjects) and included general population volunteers and patients suffering from chronic pain, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, non-small cell lung cancer, and multiple sclerosis. VAS items included measures of pain, fatigue, global health, appetite, anxiety, and alcohol effects. One study was performed in 8 to 10 year olds, the remainder in adults (18 to 86 years). Electronic modes included: PDA (n=8), PC (n=5), smartphone (n=3), tablet (n=3), feature-phone (n=2), and smartwatch (n=1). eVAS length was not reported for 5 studies, and ranged from 2 to 4 cm (n=3, min: 2.1 cm), 4.1 to 6 cm (n=5), 6.1 to 8 cm (n=3), 8.1 to 10 cm (n=2), > 10 cm (n=2, max: 28.9 cm) in the remainder. Authors of all studies concluded pVAS and eVAS were comparable. However, 2 studies reported trends towards higher scores on eVAS vs. pVAS, 3 towards lower scores on eVAS, and 2 studies (Apple Newton and Palm device) indicated eVAS scores may be lower than pVAS at the scale ends. A later study reported no scale-end effects. Differences between eVAS and pVAS were considered not clinically relevant although three publications recommended paper and electronic versions should not be used interchangeably.

Inhibition of DHODH in highly activated immune cells, such as in T cells in inflammatory bowel disease, leads to induction of metabolic stress signals with immediate onset of inhibition of cytokine release of IL-17 and IFNgamma (IFNg) and later on to induction of apoptosis in those cells driving inflammation in the bowel wall. We performed in-vitro and in-vivo experiments to further explore the impact of IMU-838 on other aspects of the immune network important in inflammatory bowel disease with particular focus on regulatory macrophages and TNFalpha (TNFa). Aims & Methods: Efficacy of IMU-838 was tested in a 2.8% DSS induced C57BL/6 colitis mouse model in a therapeutic setting with four days of colitis induction prior to treatment start with IMU-838. The impact of IMU- 838 on cytokine regulation was testes in PHA stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and in a mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). Cytokine regulation was tested via gene expression analysis and protein secretion via ELISA technique. In the MLR assay, the impact of IMU-838 on regulatory macrophages and the synergistic effects with anti-TNFa Infliximab treatment were tested via FACS analysis. Therefore, isolated PBMCs from two healthy donors were pre-incubated for 48h and then incubated for another four days with IMU-838 in four different concentrations (30, 10, 3, 1μM) with and without anti-TNFa antibody Infliximab (10μg/ml). Results: In a DSS induced colitis model, IMU-838 was administered in monotherapy with an oral low dose of 20mg/kg in a therapeutic setting. IMU-838 demonstrated improvement of the diarrhea score, the histology score and TNFa secretion as markers for improvement of the disease. Even though IMU-838 had no impact on TNFa secretion in PHA stimulated human PBMCs, a significant reduction of TNFa secretion in a mixed lymphocyte reaction assay (MLR) was found. Administration of IMU-838 to the MLR assay slightly enhanced the percentage of regulatory macrophages (which are known to be important for improvement in IBD under anti-TNF therapy). In MLR experiments combining IMU-838 and anti-TNF Infliximab a strong increase in regulatory macrophages and decrease in TNFa secretion was shown, thereby confirming a substantial synergism of the effects for the combining the two molecules. Conclusion: Preclinical experiments support that IMU-838 and its mechanism of DHODH inhibition testing of IMU-838 in clinical trials for IBD patients. Beside the already known inhibition of IL-17 and IFNg cytokine secretion as well as apoptosis induction of highly activated T cells, these recent investigations of IMU838 also indicate a beneficial impact on regulatory macrophages and inhibition of. In addition, combining IMU-838 with an anti-TNFa antibody has shown a strong synergism of effects on regulatory macrophages and TNFa secretion, which seems to indicate that a combination trial in IBD patients suffering from insufficient or reduced efficacy of anti-TNFa antibodies such as infliximab should be considered.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/205064061985467","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=20506414&id=doi:10.1177%2F205064061985467&atitle=Preclinical+investigations+of+IMU-838%2C+an+orally+available+small+molecule+inhibitor+of+Dihydroorotate+Dehydrogenase+for+the+treatment+of+inflammatory+bowel+disease&stitle=United+Eur.+Gastroenterol.+J.&title=United+European+Gastroenterology+Journal&volume=7&issue=8&spage=593&epage=&aulast=Kohlhof&aufirst=H.&auinit=H.&aufull=Kohlhof+H.&coden=&isbn=&pages=593-&date=2019&auinit1=H&auinitm=","Embase"

Available measuring tools for fatigue are limited due to the often obtrusive and subjective nature of assessment, and lack sensitivity due to time interval constraints between measurements. To circumvent these limitations, a smartphone application measuring keystroke dynamics during regular use in the daily setting has been proposed to quantify fatigue. Objectives: To assess the validity and reliability of smartphonebased keystroke dynamics for the assessment of fatigue in MS. Methods: In a prospective observational study, MS patients and healthy controls are recruited and use the Neurokeys keyboard app. Currently available keystroke parameters consists of: time between keys (flight time), keypress duration (hold time), use of punctuation marks, backspaces and long words (i.e. >6 characters). At baseline and after two weeks (retest) clinical fatigue outcomes are assessed: Checklist Individual Strength (CIS20-r), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS). Results: Inclusion is ongoing, currently 29 MS patients and 8 healthy controls completed baseline measurements. Both groups were similar in age, sex, and level of education. Using the FSS cutoff of 4.0, 18 (48.6%) were fatigued and 19 (51.4%) were nonfatigued at baseline. 'Flight time' (285.2 vs. 247.4 ms, p = 0.035) and 'punctuation ratio' (0.003 vs. 0.006, p = 0.037) were statistically significant different between fatigued and non-fatigued subjects. Only 'punctuation ratio' was significantly correlated with FSS (ρ = -0.330, p = 0.046) and MFIS (ρ = -0.358, p = 0.030). Testretest reliability analysis in the stable participants (n = 23) yielded ICCs of 0.887 (flight time), 0.936 (hold time), 0.693 (backspace ratio), 0.351 (punctuation ratio), and 0.116 (long words ratio). Conclusions: Both flight time duration and use of punctuation marks demonstrated construct validity, while only flight time duration also demonstrated reliability.

Here, we studied multiple sclerosis (MS) as a model neurological disease for investigating physiometric and environmental signals. The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility and correlation of wearable biosensors with traditional clinical measures of disability both in clinic and in free-living in MS patients. This is a single site observational cohort study conducted at an academic neurological center specializing in MS. A cohort of 25 MS patients with varying disability scores were recruited. Patients were monitored in clinic while wearing biosensors at nine body locations at three separate visits. Biosensor-derived features including aspects of gait (stance time, turn angle, mean turn velocity) and balance were collected, along with standardized disability scores assessed by a neurologist. Participants also wore up to three sensors on the wrist, ankle, and sternum for 8 weeks as they went about their daily lives. The primary outcomes were feasibility, adherence, as well as correlation of biosensor-derived metrics with traditional neurologist-assessed clinical measures of disability. We used machine-learning algorithms to extract multiple features of motion and dexterity and correlated these measures with more traditional measures of neurological disability, including the expanded disability status scale (EDSS) and the MS functional composite-4 (MSFC-4). In free-living, sleep measures were additionally collected. Twenty-three subjects completed the first two of three in-clinic study visits and the 8-week free-living biosensor period. Several biosensor-derived features significantly correlated with EDSS and MSFC-4 scores derived at visit two, including mobility stance time with MSFC-4 z-score (Spearman correlation −0.546; p = 0.0070), several aspects of turning including turn angle (0.437; p = 0.0372), and maximum angular velocity (0.653; p = 0.0007). Similar correlations were observed at subsequent clinic visits, and in the free-living setting. We also found other passively collected signals, including measures of sleep, that correlated with disease severity. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of applying passive biosensor measurement techniques to monitor disability in MS patients both in clinic and in the free-living setting.","Article","10.1038/S41746-019-0197-7","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=23986352&id=doi:10.1038%2Fs41746-019-0197-7&atitle=Quantifying+neurologic+disease+using+biosensor+measurements+in-clinic+and+in+free-living+settings+in+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=npj+Digit.+Med.&title=npj+Digital+Medicine&volume=2&issue=1&spage=&epage=&aulast=Chitnis&aufirst=Tanuja&auinit=T.&aufull=Chitnis+T.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2019&auinit1=T&auinitm=","Embase"

Key criteria are around scalability, extensibility, security, and privacy. METHODS: RADAR-base is developed as a modular application; the backend is built on a backbone of the highly successful Confluent/Apache Kafka framework for streaming data. To facilitate scaling and ease of deployment, we use Docker containers to package the components of the platform. RADAR-base provides 2 main mobile apps for data collection, a Passive App and an Active App. Other third-Party Apps and sensors are easily integrated into the platform. Management user interfaces to support data collection and enrolment are also provided. RESULTS: General principles of the platform components and design of RADAR-base are presented here, with examples of the types of data currently being collected from devices used in RADAR-CNS projects: Multiple Sclerosis, Epilepsy, and Depression cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: RADAR-base is a fully functional, remote data collection platform built around Confluent/Apache Kafka and provides off-the-shelf components for projects interested in collecting mHealth datasets at scale.","Article","10.2196/11734","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=22915222&id=doi:10.2196%2F11734&atitle=RADAR-Base%3A+Open+Source+Mobile+Health+Platform+for+Collecting%2C+Monitoring%2C+and+Analyzing+Data+Using+Sensors%2C+Wearables%2C+and+Mobile+Devices&stitle=JMIR+Mhealth+Uhealth&title=JMIR+mHealth+and+uHealth&volume=7&issue=8&spage=e11734&epage=&aulast=Ranjan&aufirst=Yatharth&auinit=Y.&aufull=Ranjan+Y.&coden=&isbn=&pages=e11734-&date=2019&auinit1=Y&auinitm=","Embase"

Despite the plethora of applications, the current cooling systems are cumbersome to use due to their excessive size. In this work this issue is resolved by developing soft, thermally conductive silicone-aluminum composite tubes. To achieve optimal device performance, the material must be designed to balance the decrease in bulk thermal resistance and the increase in interfacial tube-substrate resistance due to composite stiffening. Thus, to enable the rational design of such tubes, a closed form thermomechanical model that predicts cooling performance as a function of tube geometry and filler fraction is developed and experimentally validated. Predictions via this model and experiments are used to reveal how the tube's geometrical and material design can be adjusted to minimize the required length of tubing and maximize the heat extracted from a metallic surface and skin. Lastly, through a holistic analysis, this work demonstrates that besides significantly increasing overall cooling capability, the use of low-resistance tubing can provide a multifold reduction in the cooling system size and enable novel operating modes.","Article","10.1002/ADMT.201800690","WOS:000474669100013","WoS"

This study forms part of the EU Innovative Medicines Initiative project: Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse in the CNS (RADAR-CNS), a pan-European consortium, uniting experts in clinical research, engineering and computer science, with the ambition to improve the management of major depressive disorder, epilepsy and MS through use of wearable devices and smartphone technology. Methods: The MS workpackage is a multicenter study with two prospective projects. Project 1 has the aim to assess the impact of MS diagnosis on a patient's emotional state. Project 2 aims to monitoring a patient's sleep quality, mobility, balance and cardiovascular autonomic function in order to detect predictors of relapses and of disability progression. Results: About 600 MS patients will be longitudinally followed for 2 years in 3 European MS centers: Milan San Raffaele, Barcelona Vall d'Hebron and Copenhagen Rigshospitalet. Prospective RMT will include both passive and active strategies. Data provided by RMT will be compared with a set of clinical variables, including disability, fatigue, cognitive, affective and locomotor measures collected at regular visits every 3 months. Ten and 135 patients have been recruited so far for project 1 and project 2 respectively. Methodology and baseline characteristics of the population will be presented.

It has good face validity and ample validation against research grade accelerometers. 1,2 This measure is an exploratory endpoint of SPI2, a phase 3 trial investigating the efficacy and safety of MD1003 (high dose Pharmaceutical grade Biotin) in patients with not active primary and secondary progressive MS (PPMS, SPMS). Objective: To assess the relationship between ambulatory monitoring and clinical disability/MRI measures in not active progressive MS patients in the SPI2 study. Methods: Remote monitoring of ambulatory activity in patients receiving either MD1003 300 mg/day or placebo was collected using a Fitbit FlexR device. Average daily step count from the first 30-days (STEPS) was used for the baseline activity measure. The daily goal on the device was initially set low to minimize the impact of motivation on ambulatory activity. LASSO subset selection regression models were used to correlate STEPS with sex, age, disease duration, onset age, disease course, and separate MRI models (TCA:upper cervical cord area; GMV:grey matter volume, NBV:normalized brain volume, THV:thalamic volume, T1L/T2L:T1/T2 lesion volumes) Least Squares regression models were performed on the subset selection results. Spearman correlations were conducted between STEPS and clinical disability (EDSS, T25FW:timed 25-foot walk), and MSQoL-29 (PHC/MHC:Physical/Mental Health Composite) measures. Results: As of April 23rd, there were 492 enrolled patients with full STEPS data drawn from 90 centres (USA: 40, Europe: 39, Canada: 8, Australia: 3). Of these, 311 were diagnosed with SPMS, 181 with PPMS, and 262 were women. Participants had moderate disability (median EDSS, 6.0; IQR 4.5-6.0). Mean STEPS over the first month was 3699 (SD: 2962). STEPS correlated to EDSS (N=490, p< 0.001), T25FW (N=490, p< 0.001), PHCS-29 (N=446 p< 0.0001), SDMT (N=492, p=0.0004), but not MHCS-29 (N=458, p=0.163). STEPS correlated with TCA (p=0.003), NBV (p=0.001), GMV (p=0.01), T1L (p=0.04); THV and T2L were not significant. Conclusion: STEPS correlate to clinical measures of ambulation (EDSS, T25FW), cognitive function (SDMT), MRI atrophy metrics (NBV, GMV and TCA) and quality of life (PHCS-29) in the SPI2 study. Remote gait monitoring via Fitbit may be a general surrogate for MS disability in clinical trials.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458519868070","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13524585&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458519868070&atitle=Remotely+monitored+ambulatory+activity+correlates+with+MS+disability+not+only+for+ambulation+but+also+for+MRI+atrophy+metrics%2C+cognition+and+quality+of+life%3A+Baseline+analysis+from+the+SPI2+clinical+trial+of+MD1003+in+progressive+MS&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=25&issue=&spage=79&epage=&aulast=Block&aufirst=V.&auinit=V.&aufull=Block+V.&coden=&isbn=&pages=79-&date=2019&auinit1=V&auinitm=","Embase"

The interim goal is to develop simple smartphone tests (apps) and evaluate the clinical utility of these tests by selecting optimal outcomes that correlate well with clinician-measured disability in different neurological domains. In this paper, we used prospectively-acquired data from 112 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and 15 healthy volunteers (HV) to assess the performance and optimize outcomes of a Level Test. The goal of the test is to tilt the smartphone so that a free-rolling ball travels to and remains in the center of the screen. An accelerometer detects tilting and records the coordinates of the ball at set time intervals. From this data, we derived five features: path length traveled, time spent in the center of the screen, average distance from the center, average speed while in the center, and number of direction changes underwent by the ball. Time in center proved to be the most sensitive feature to differentiate MS patients from HV and had the strongest correlations with clinician-derived scales. Its superiority was validated in an independent validation cohort of 29 MS patients. A linear combination of different Level features failed to outperform time in center in an independent validation cohort. Limited longitudinal data demonstrated that the Level features were relatively stable intra-individually within 4 months, without definitive evidence of learning. In contrast to previously developed smartphone tests that predominantly measure motoric functions, Level features correlated strongly with reaction time and moderately with cerebellar functions and proprioception, validating its complementary clinical value in the MS app suite. The Level Test measures neurological disability in several domains in two independent cross-sectional cohorts (original and validation). An ongoing longitudinal cohort further investigates whether patient-autonomous collection of granular functional data allows measurement of patient-specific trajectories of disability progression to better guide treatment decisions.","Article","10.3389/FNEUR.2019.00358","WOS:000469272100001","WoS"

Therefore, measuring and monitoring fatigue is of importance for patient care and clinical trials. A smartphone-based assessment of fatigue and fatigability in a day-to-day setting has been developed. Objectives: To evaluate validity and reliability of smartphonebased measurements of fatigue and fatigability in MS. Methods: In a prospective observational study MS patients and healthy control subjects are recruited. At baseline and twoweeks follow-up, clinical fatigue measures are assessed: Checklist Individual Strength (CIS20-r), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), and Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS). Smartphonebased measurements are performed daily and includes: a 7-point Likert fatigue rating score and a two-minute eye movement fatigability task captured with the front-facing camera. Eye movement parameters includes: saccadic initiation time, amplitude and velocity. Participants performed the fatigue and fatigability measurements before and after a two-minute walk test or a SDMT task, which were used to induce motor and cognitive fatigue, respectively. Results: With ongoing subject inclusion, currently 33 MS patients and 10 healthy controls are included. Both groups were similar in age, sex and level of education. Mean digital fatigue ratings significantly correlated with CIS (ρ = 0.654), FSS (ρ = 0.659), and MFIS (ρ = 0.656) at baseline.

The app allows to perform video-consultations, to post news, videos illustrating rehabilitation and major symptoms, and to answer to pwMS' questions including those regarding mild or moderate AEs of DMTs. Notifications are sent directly via app to the patients, informing them about upcoming visits and scheduled laboratory controls. pwMS attending routine clinical visits were enrolled and were invited to download the SMcare2.0 app on their smartphone. The MSQOL-54 questionnaire was administered to pwMS before starting to use the app and three months later. Results: Fifty pwMS were enrolled (72% female; mean (SD) age: 38.9 (12.0) years; 96% relapsing-remitting). The last DMTs reported was: natalizumab (38%), fingolimod (18%), interferon beta (14%), glatiramer acetate (8%), dimethylfumarate (4%), ocrelizumab (2%), azathioprine (2%) and alemtuzumab (2%). A total of 167 video consultations were performed and 47 AEs were reported and effectively managed by the nurses. The overall response rate to the MSQOL-54 was 100%.

Objective: Hypothesis: This preliminary, cross-sectional study examined social-cognitive theory(SCT) variables as correlates of sedentary behavior in MS. We hypothesized that scores from SCT variables for sedentary behavior change would correlate with scores from self-reported and device-measured volumes of sedentary behavior in MS. We further hypothesized that the correlations would be stronger for self-reported than device-measured sedentary behavior, and that the primary correlate of sedentary behavior would be self-efficacy. Methods: We recruited participants through a random sample of 1,000 persons enrolled in the North American Research Committee on MS registry, and 275 of the 296 persons who underwent screening volunteered for the study. Participants wore an ActiGraph accelerometer on a belt around the waist for measuring minutes per day of sedentary behavior. Participants further completed a newly-created, study-specific measure of SCT variables for reducing sedentary behavior(i.e., self-efficacy, outcome expectations, barriers, goal setting, & planning) and the abbreviated International Physical Activity Questionnaire as a self-report measure of sitting time. Results: Self-reported sedentary behavior was associated with self-efficacy(r = −0.47), goal setting(r = −0.31), planning(r = −0.35), and barriers(r = 0.39) for reducing sedentary behavior. Device-measured sedentary behavior was associated with self-efficacy(r = −0.32), goal setting(r = −0.21), planning(r = −0.18), and barriers(r = 0.20). Self-efficacy(β = −0.29), barriers(β = 0.26), and planning(β = −0.24) independently explained variance in self-reported sedentary behavior(R(2) = 0.33). Only self-efficacy(β = −0.32) independently explained variance in device-measured sedentary behavior(R(2) = 0.10). Conclusion: SCT constructs might be reasonable targets of a behavioral intervention for reducing sedentary behavior in MS.","Article","10.1016/J.DHJO.2019.05.002","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=18767583&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.dhjo.2019.05.002&atitle=Social-cognitive+theory+variables+as+correlates+of+sedentary+behavior+in+multiple+sclerosis%3A+Preliminary+evidence&stitle=Disabil.+Health+J.&title=Disability+and+Health+Journal&volume=12&issue=4&spage=622&epage=627&aulast=Motl&aufirst=Robert+W.&auinit=R.W.&aufull=Motl+R.W.&coden=&isbn=&pages=622-627&date=2019&auinit1=R&auinitm=W","Embase"

The Alemtuzumab in MS Safety Systems (AMS3) study evaluated the implementation of an automated pathology-monitoring system. Objectives: To develop an efficient automated clinical decision support system (CDSS) to electronically prompt and track pathology collection and to provide prescribers and patients with customised alerts of abnormal results for identified risks. Methods: A total of 10 patients with relapsing-remitting MS treated with alemtuzumab were enrolled to test the system. Standard care laboratory monitoring was performed and compared to the performance of the CDSS. Results: The automated CDSS, an integrated patient smartphone application and an additional pre-screening tool were all successfully developed. Compliance with pathology monitoring was 96.7%. The automated analysis of pathology results was significantly faster than standard care neurologist review (p < 0.001). The system correctly identified and alerted abnormalities, including one case of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) while the treating neurologist was on leave, enabling prompt treatment of serious adverse events. During the course of the study, the CDSS was deployed throughout Australia.

Complex balance tasks, such as tandem walking, are probably more sensitive in detecting mild balance difficulties compared to the standard traditional tests in this population. Research question: The aim was to investigate different types of 3-meter tandem walking tests in fully ambulatory PwMS. Methods: This observational case-control study included 50 participants; 25 PwMS, 17 women and 8 men, aged 35.2 (S.D = 8.6) and 25 healthy subjects, 18 women and 7 men, aged 34.3 (S.D = 6.1). The 3-meter tandem walk tests were performed during a single session. Each subject completed a sequence of 3 consecutive tests under 3 different task conditions: normal tandem walking, backward tandem walking and cognitive tandem walking. Tandem walking tests were evaluated via three small, lightweight axial wearable accelerometers (APDM, Oregon, USA). Results: The mean EDSS for the MS group was 1.6 (S.D = 0.6) indicating minimal disability. PwMS walked slower and at a slower pace, with a prolonged double support and decreased swing phase compared to healthy subjects in normal and backward conditions. In contrast, during the cognitive task, non-significant differences were found in gait measures between the PwMS and the healthy controls. Significant differences were found between task conditions for all participants. All reduced their walking speed and walked at a slower pace in both the cognitive and backward conditions compared to the normal tandem walk condition. However, non-significant scores were found for the condition X group factor. Significance: The study provides new insights into the 3-meter tandem walk test. Findings should improve evaluation and training of dynamic balance in fully ambulatory PwMS.","Article","10.1016/J.GAITPOST.2019.02.022","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=18792219&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.gaitpost.2019.02.022&atitle=The+ability+of+the+instrumented+tandem+walking+tests+to+discriminate+fully+ambulatory+people+with+MS+from+healthy+adults&stitle=Gait+Posture&title=Gait+and+Posture&volume=70&issue=&spage=90&epage=94&aulast=Grinberg&aufirst=Yevgenia&auinit=Y.&aufull=Grinberg+Y.&coden=GAPOF&isbn=&pages=90-94&date=2019&auinit1=Y&auinitm=","Embase"

This approach is motivated by the goal of diagnosing gait abnormalities on a symptom-by-symptom basis, irrespective of other neuromuscular movement disorders the patients may be affected by. This could lead to improvements in treatment and offer a greater insight into movement disorders. Methods: In-shoe pressure was measured for 12 able-bodied participants, each subject to eight artificially induced gait alterations, achieved by modifying the underside of the shoe. The data were recorded at 100 Hz over 2520 data channels and were analyzed using the deep learning architecture and the long term short term memory networks. Additionally, the rationale for the decision-making process of these networks was investigated. Conclusion: Long term short term memory networks are applicable to the classification of the gait function. The classifications can be made using only 2 s of sparse data (82.0% accuracy over 96 000 instances of test data) from participants who were not a part of the training set. Significance: This paper provides potential for the gait function to be accurately classified using non-invasive techniques, and at more regular intervals, outside of a clinical setting, without the need for healthcare professionals to be present.","Article","10.1109/TBME.2019.2900863","WOS:000502102200015","WoS"

Immunic has developed a new chemical entity DHODH inhibitor, IMU-838, the calcium salt of Vidofludimus, which currently is in phase 2 clinical trials for RRMS and ulcerative colitis. Goal: The objective of investigations was to explore the efficacy and safety profile of IMU-838 compared to Teriflunomide. Method: Multiple-species DHODH inhibition studies with determination of IC50 were conducted for IMU-838 and Teriflunomide using human, rat and mouse enzyme. Differential inhibition of IL-17 and IFN-γ were assessed in PHA-stimulated PBMCs. The inhibitory effect of IMU-838 was examined on more than 100 protein kinases. Human pharmacokinetics data and elimination period of IMU-838 and Teriflunomide were measured and compared. IMU-838 was tested for efficacy in an EAE (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis) rat model in comparison with Teriflunomide. Results: IMU-838 has shown a 10-fold higher potency on human DHODH as compared to Teriflunomide. The IC50 on IL-17 and IFN-γ of IMU-838 is much lower with 6μM compared to Teriflunomide with 25μM. The kinase panel showed no off-target effect of IMU-838 at concentrations of up to 300μM. Biological selectivity for IMU-838 in animal models was shown by absence of any effect on number of bone marrow cells despite large doses. In a rat EAE model, IMU-838 exhibited dose-dependent inhibition of motor signs, with a decrease in cumulative disease scores and demonstrated a positive impact on weight gain. In human PK studies, the serum half-life of Vidofludimus was 30 hours with no loading dose required and steady state trough levels reached after 5 to 7 days. Human subjects had no detectable blood levels of IMU-838 at 10 days following the last dose. Previous placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials of IMU-838 in patient populations outside MS, had shown no increased rate of diarrhea, alopecia, neutropenia, increase in liver function tests or infections versus placebo. Conclusion: IMU-838 demonstrated efficacy in an animal model for RRMS and showed an overall improved profile as compared to Teriflunomide regarding PK and off-target effects. To demonstrate efficacy in RRMS, we initiated a placebo-controlled phase 2 clinical trial.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458519868078","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13524585&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458519868078&atitle=The+DHODH+inhibitor+IMU-838%2FVidofludimus+calcium+shows+a+superior+compound+profile+as+compared+to+the+approved+DHODH+inhibitor+Teriflunomide%2FAubagio&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=25&issue=&spage=308&epage=&aulast=Kohlhof&aufirst=H.&auinit=H.&aufull=Kohlhof+H.&coden=&isbn=&pages=308-&date=2019&auinit1=H&auinitm=","Embase"

As is shown in the literature, the tremor can be investigated by accelerometers and gyroscopes based on the frequency analysis and other advanced methods of signal processing. A condition of the successful development of these methods is an existence of a signal database of healthy subjects. This paper concerns with the collecting of the signal database of healthy control subjects. The signals were acquired on the group of healthy subjects aged from 18 to 50 years (20 subjects). For each patient, one-minute records of postural tremor (for both right and left hand, with and without closed eyes; 4 records together) have been acquired, and also several clinical tests have been passed (a measurement of a strength by a handgrip, a pinch key, and a trippod test, a nine-hole peg test, a coin rotation task test, and a tip pinch test).

Disease-specific clinical scales exist; however, they are often susceptible to subjectivity, and can lack sensitivity when identifying subtle gait and postural impairments in prodromal cohorts and longitudinally to document disease progression. Numerous devices are available to objectively quantify a range of measurement outcomes pertaining to gait and postural control; however, efforts are required to standardise and harmonise approaches that are specific to the neurological condition and clinical assessment. Tools are urgently needed that address a number of unmet needs in neurological practice. Namely, these include timely and accurate diagnosis; disease stratification; risk prediction; tracking disease progression; and decision making for intervention optimisation and maximising therapeutic response (such as medication selection, disease staging, and targeted support). Using some recent examples of research across a range of relevant neurological conditions—including Parkinson’s disease, ataxia, and dementia— we will illustrate evidence that supports progress against these unmet clinical needs.

Although disease activity can be monitored by the development of clinical relapses and new lesions on MRI, accumulating disability or silent progression, is difficult to identify early. With the emerging interest in health monitoring technology we sought to investigate the usability of wearable devices in monitoring long term motor function in MS. Methods: In this observational prospective study 19 patients with MS, following ethics approval, were fitted with a Fitbit Inspire device. Six Minute Timed Walk (6MTW) data was obtained under clinical supervision and Home-based Fitbit usage was monitored remotely. Fatigability was measured by comparing the step count at minute 1 versusminute 6 of the 6MTW. Results: The mean daily adherence rate is 85.4%. The adherence rate of completing the Home 6MTWdropped over the study period from 34.2% to 5.3%. The patients performed 17.6 steps higher on average in the minute 6 versus minute 1 in the 6MTW. Conclusion In this pilot study we found a high rate of adherence to regular use of the Fitbit. Fatigability was not identified on the 6MTW.

Changes in PB are often assumed as a consequence of fatigue, but effects of interventions that aim to reduce fatigue by improving PB are not sufficient. Since the heterogeneous nature of MS related symptoms, levels of PB of fatigued patients at the start of interventions might vary substantially. Better understanding of the variability by identification of PB subtypes in fatigued patients may help to develop more effective personalized rehabilitation programs in the future. This study aimed to identify PB subtypes in fatigued patients with multiple sclerosis based on multidimensional PB outcome measures. Methods: Baseline accelerometer (Actigraph) data, demographics and clinical characteristics of the TREFAMS-ACE participants (n = 212) were used for secondary analysis. All patients were ambulatory and diagnosed with severe fatigue based on a score of ≥35 on the fatigue subscale of the Checklist Individual Strength (CIS20r). Fifteen PB measures were used derived from 7 day measurements with an accelerometer. Principal component analysis was performed to define key outcome measures for PB and two-step cluster analysis was used to identify PB types. Results: Analysis revealed five key outcome measures: percentage sedentary behavior, total time in prolonged moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, number of sedentary bouts, and two types of change scores between day parts (morning, afternoon and evening). Based on these outcomes three valid PB clusters were derived. Conclusions: Patients with severe MS-related fatigue show three distinct and homogeneous PB subtypes. These PB subtypes, based on a unique set of PB outcome measures, may offer an opportunity to design more individually-tailored interventions in rehabilitation.

The T and B cells, the body’s immune cells, start attacking the brain and spinal cord, leading to a variety of symptoms. Alemtuzumab is a recently approved disease-modifying therapy that has been shown to have a very high impact on MS. However, it has many potentially life-threatening side effects which patients are often not aware of. For treatments as effective and risky as Alemtuzumab, patients who are considering it must be well-informed on the process and the potential side effects. Patient education is vital to equip patients with knowledge on their disease and treatment, and has shown to be successful in improving the management of chronic diseases and increasing medication adherence. Unfortunately, the language used is often too complex and at a higher reading level than average patients can comprehend, and available resources such as pamphlets and websites are often disorganized. This research proposes a radically different approach to patient education, using less formal channels such as a mobile application to improve health literacy, using LEMTRADA® (Alemtuzumab) as an example. MS patients were involved in a co-design process to produce a series of user-friendly, intuitive and interactive graphical interfaces which propose plain language, illustrations, animations, audio and Augmented Reality components that aim to enhance patients’ knowledge retention and recall. Finally, nine MS patients along with a senior MS nurse tested the mobile application and answered a usability questionnaire that aimed to compare the delivery of information with typical websites and pamphlets. Results suggested this approach to be highly user-friendly and engaging, improving patients’ understanding of medical information considerably. This research illustrates more engaging channels to communicate with MS patients in order to enhance health literacy.","Chapter","10.1007/978-3-030-06070-1_6","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=22148019&id=doi:10.1007%2F978-3-030-06070-1_6&atitle=Towards+a+more+user-friendly+medication+information+delivery+to+people+living+with+multiple+sclerosis%3A+A+case+study+with+alemtuzumab&stitle=Adv.+Exp.+Med.+Biol.&title=Advances+in+Experimental+Medicine+and+Biology&volume=1120&issue=&spage=67&epage=82&aulast=Azman&aufirst=Amal&auinit=A.&aufull=Azman+A.&coden=AEMBA&isbn=&pages=67-82&date=2019&auinit1=A&auinitm=","Embase"

This assessment was realised using cognitive tests (assessing memory, attention, reaction time, information processing speed and executive function), self-assessment, contextual factors and facial feature analysis. This study also investigated the use of an ensemble algorithm for the classification of cognitive fatigue utilising facial features and a Rotation Forest approach. Self-assessment of cognitive fatigue was shown to directly correlate with reaction time through a Psychomotor Vigilance Task (r = .643, p = .001), and self-reported increases in the level of social activity (r = .377, p = .001). Facial feature analysis revealed dominant emotions of sadness and anger when participants were cognitively fatigued. It also revealed underlying facial cues that indicated higher levels of cognitive fatigue including expressions of negative valence, and Facial Action Coding System units of increased brow furrow, eyelid tightening and lip suck. In addition, a Principle Component Analysis based Rotation Forest ensemble with a ternary output demonstrated a cognitive fatigue classification accuracy of 82.17%. The findings presented indicate that the inclusion of data relating to surrounding cognitive, social, physical and emotional factors can improve the accuracy of mobile in-situ cognitive fatigue assessment using our previously validated smartphone-based cognitive fatigue assessment approach. The findings further suggest gross-level fatigue status may be potentially classified to a reasonable degree of accuracy using facial features, which may give rise to personalised in-situ fatigue detection.","Article","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2935540","WOS:000484233300005","WoS"

However, these tests are administered in the clinic and insufficient to capture fluctuations in fatigue and other symptoms that increase fall risk in persons with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS). We explored the agreement between assessments performed in the clinic with 2-days of self-reported symptoms and self-performed functional outcome measures following the clinical assessment. Objectives: Comparison of clinical and daily life assessments of functional mobility and patient reported symptoms. Methods: Ten PwMS (EDSS 1.0-4.0) completed the Activity Specific Balance Confidence scale and the 5-Times Sit to Stand in the clinic. Wearable sensors were used to compute test completion time. PwMS were sent home with wearable sensors and continuously monitored for 2-days. Text messages sent every two (waking) hours asked them to rate fatigue and perform the 30 Second Chair Stand Test (30CST). The average sit-to-stand transition rate was compared for the clinic and daily life conditions. Correlation coefficients quantified relationships between transition rates with MS severity and participant perception of fatigue. A paired-sample t-test was used to assess differences between transition rate in the clinic versus home settings. Results: PwMS demonstrated high compliance for reporting fatigue and 30CST performance every 2-hours (91% compliance rate). In the home participants performed sit-to-stand significantly faster than in the clinic (P=0.02). Preliminary analysis of inertial sensor data indicate that participants tended to overcount sit-to-stand performance. Correlations between transition rates and symptom severity were stronger for the clinic versus self-report measurements likely due to self-report errors. Conclusion: Patients are willing to participate in activities that continuously monitor their symptom fluctuation. However, clinic assessments have stronger agreement with measures of symptom severity when compared to home-based assessments. In future studies we plan to analyze the rate of sit-to-stand transitions performed continuously throughout the day using sensor data to compare to self-report measures. These data could be used to quantify real-time fluctuations and provide feedback to decrease fall risk.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458519843084","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458519843084&atitle=Transitioning+assessments+from+the+clinic+to+daily+life%3A+Exploring+sit-to-stand+transition+rates+as+a+means+for+assessing+symptom+fluctuation&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=25&issue=&spage=43&epage=44&aulast=Tulipani&aufirst=Lindsey+J.&auinit=L.J.&aufull=Tulipani+L.J.&coden=&isbn=&pages=43-44&date=2019&auinit1=L&auinitm=J","Embase"

Accelerometery might represent possible appraisal method of upper limb movements dynamics in patients with MS. The aim of our preliminary study is to create a data set for evaluation of upper limbs acceleration peak and cycles/sec during the movement of flexion and extension of the elbow in shoulder abduction in 74 subjects with MS, in order to examine whether kinematic assessment might be comparable with upper limb function measures. Materials and Method: 74 MS subjects [29M/45F - median age 51(17-80); median EDSS 5,75(0-7,5); relapsing-remitting 48, secondary progressive 17, primary progressive 8] were recruited and underwent upper limb kinematic assessment with 3-Space™ Wireless sensor, a triaxial inertial sensor which collect recorded data through computer program. All subjects were evaluated with these tests: EDSS, DASH, MAM-36, Abilhand, MAL, 9HPT, BB, Scripps scale, Ashworth scale, BICAMS, MSIS-29, MFIS, Tremor Severity scale, hand grip. Results: No differences were detected between males and females in terms of age, cycles/sec and acceleration peak. No correlation was found between age, Cycles/sec and peak of acceleration. The data obtained were elaborated in percentiles, as follows: cycles/sec right: 5° 0,28; 25° 0,48; 50° 0,61; 75° 0,80; 95° 1,19; cycles/sec left: 5° 0,20; 25° 0,45; 50° 0,62; 75° 0,93; 95° 1,15.

It is unknown what demographic and clinical characteristics are associated with use of eHealth technologies in MS. As these technologies are more widely adopted in health settings, it is important that health care providers understand who is using them, and to recognize potential disparities if they exist. Objective: We aimed to examine the use of eHealth technologies among persons with multiple sclerosis (MS), including the adoption of mobile Health (mHealth) applications (apps) and telehealth, perceived benefits of using mHealth apps, and sociodemographic and clinical characteristics associated with use of these technologies. Methods: In the spring 2017, we surveyed participants in the North American Research Committee on Multiple Sclerosis (NARCOMS) Registry about their use of eHealth technologies using questions adapted from the Health Information National Trends (HINTS) 4 Cycle 4 survey. Participants reported their internet use, electronic devices used, use of health related software apps and perceived benefits from using those apps, and their interest in exchanging medical information with a health care professional electronically. We used descriptive statistics to report use of eHealth technologies and multivariable logistic regression to evaluate factors associated with use of electronic devices, use of mHealth apps, telehealth use, and perceived benefits of using mHealth apps. Results: Of 6423 participants included in the analysis most participants were female, and white, with a mean (SD) age of 59.7 (10.1) years. Overall, 5408 (84.2%) had exchanged medical information with a health professional most often using a secure online portal (1839, 28.6%), followed by email (1327, 20.7%). of the 5529 smartphone and tablet users, 2556 (46.2%) used a mHealth app. Factors associated with a higher likelihood of reporting use of smartphones or tablets, mHealth apps and with perceived benefits of using these apps included online survey response, younger age, having comorbidities, and higher income and education levels. Conclusion: Use of eHealth technologies is common in the MS population and facilitates the exchange of health care information with providers. Use of mHealth apps is perceived to have health benefits. However, use of eHealth and mHealth technologies varies substantially with sociodemographic factors, and health care providers need to be aware of these disparities as these technologies are increasingly leveraged in health care settings.","Article","10.1016/J.MSARD.2018.09.036","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=22110356&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.msard.2018.09.036&atitle=Use+of+eHealth+and+mHealth+technology+by+persons+with+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+Relat.+Disord.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+and+Related+Disorders&volume=27&issue=&spage=13&epage=19&aulast=Marrie&aufirst=Ruth+Ann&auinit=R.A.&aufull=Marrie+R.A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=13-19&date=2019&auinit1=R&auinitm=A","Embase"

Therefore, a modern standardized disease management needs to integrate patients' needs and abilities with the help of time- and cost-saving health information technology to improve the connection between healthcare professionals, patients and informal care providers. Goals: To develop an eHealth system (Integrated Care Portal for Multiple Sclerosis) for pwMS that supports all aspects of integrated care using efficient telemedical structures via a participatory design and extending an electronic medical record that can be also used by the patient itself. Methods: Using well-established structures, the integrated care portal will extend a multinational patient management solution (Multiple Sclerosis Documentation System 3D). Applying a usercentered design, we collected information from focus groups, large-scale patient (43 items) and physician surveys (37 items). Therefore, neurologists and pwMS were enrolled in Germany between 2017 and 2019 to address both quantitative and qualitative design issues concerning the use of information technology, disease-related barriers, requirements and needs. Results: In total, 251 participants from 18 to over 60 years provided answers to our survey. For patients, median duration of disease was 6 to 10 years. PwMS used smartphones, computers (76.6% each), and tablets (40.5%) regularly while smartwatches (5.7%) were rarely used. Online health information seeking (73.3%), making appointments (54.0%), contacting physicians (40.0%) and even self-tracking (22.1%) were tasks of pwMS on an at least weekly basis. 89.5% of them reported to be interested in a specialized portal for pwMS. Most appreciated care portal features were functions of treatment-related education (87.8%), scheduling (87.3%), accessing personal health information (85.8%), medication management (82.7%), messaging with HCPs (81.1%) and self-assessment (68.9%). Half of the pwMS (49.2%) also appreciated telemedical consulting. Conclusions: With our integrated care portal, patient involvement will be strengthened by a purposeful assistance in organizing and caring. In addition, context-sensitive information for patients and their relatives as well as concrete recommendations and options for action based on this information were preferred functions for a care portal for pwMS.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458519868078","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13524585&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458519868078&atitle=User-centered+development+of+an+integrated+disease+management+portal+for+patients+with+multiple+sclerosis%3A+Results+of+patient+%26+physician+surveys&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=25&issue=&spage=350&epage=351&aulast=Haase&aufirst=R.&auinit=R.&aufull=Haase+R.&coden=&isbn=&pages=350-351&date=2019&auinit1=R&auinitm=","Embase"

We developed a 5-minute computerized test to measure cognitive dysfunction in patients with MS. The proposed test -named Integrated Cognitive Assessment (ICA)- is self-administered and languageindependent (Khaligh-Razavi et al., 2019). Here we determine ICA's validity as a digital biomarker for assessing cognitive performance in baseline and monitoring disease activity. ICA's AI platform uses a combination of subject's demographics and ICA test output to detect cognitive impairment. 91 MS patients and 83 healthy controls (HC) took part in substudy 1, in which each participant took the ICA test and the Brief International Cognitive Assessment for MS (BICAMS). We assessed ICA's test-retest reliability, its correlation with BICAMS, its sensitivity to discriminate patients with MS from the HC group, and its accuracy in detecting cognitive dysfunction. In substudy 2, we recruited 48 MS patients, 38 of them subscribed to an 8-week physical/cognitive rehabilitation program, and the rest were the control group. We examined the level of serum NfL pre and post rehabilitation, as well as patients' EDSS and ICA score. ICA demonstrated excellent test-retest reliability (r=0.94), with no learning bias (i.e. no significant practice effect); and had high levels of convergent validity with BICAMS. ICA was sensitive in discriminating the MS patients from the HC group, and demonstrated a high accuracy (AUC = 95%) in detecting cognitive impairment. Additionally, we found a strong association (r=-0.79) between ICA score and the level of NfL in MS patients. In the rehabilitation group, after the 8-week rehabilitation program, we observed a significant increase in subject's ICA score (Cohen's d=0.8, p< 0.0001), and a significant decrease in their level of serum-NfL and EDSS (d=-0.4, p< 0.01). Whereas in the control group, we found the opposite pattern after 8 weeks, that is a decrease in ICA score (d=-0.4, p>0.05) and a significant increase in the level of serum- NfL (d=0.9,p< 0.001) and EDSS (d=1.0, p< 0.03). ICA can be used as a digital biomarker for assessment and monitoring of cognitive performance in MS patients. For more frequent cognitive assessments, digital biomarkers have an advantage over fluid biomarkers, given their lower cost, accessibility, the possibility of remote administration and easier integration into routine clinical practice.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458519868081","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13524585&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458519868081&atitle=Using+ICA-an+artificial+intelligence+%28AI%29-assisted+technology-as+a+digital+biomarker+of+MS+disease+progression+and+treatment+efficacy&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=25&issue=&spage=722&epage=723&aulast=Khaligh-Razavi&aufirst=S.-M.&auinit=S.-M.&aufull=Khaligh-Razavi+S.-M.&coden=&isbn=&pages=722-723&date=2019&auinit1=S&auinitm=-M","Embase"

Methods: Thirty-one individuals with MS participated in a 7-day validation by the Fitbit Flex (Flex), Fitbit Flex-2 (Flex2) and ActiGraph GT3X. Primary outcome was step count. Valid epochs of 5-min block increments, where there was overlap of ≥1 step/min for both devices were compared and summed to give a daily total for analysis. Results: Bland–Altman plots showed no systematic difference between the Flex and Flex2; mean step-count difference of 25 more steps-per-day more recorded by Flex2 (95% confidence intervals (CI) = 2, 48; p = 0.04),interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = 1.00.

Method: Persons with MS were recruited through the distribution of printed letters to a random sample of 1,000 persons from the North American Research Committee on MS registry. Two hundred ninety-five persons with MS were interested and volunteered to wear an ActiGraph accelerometer for a 7-day period and complete a battery of questionnaires that included the IPAQ-SF and Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire over this period of time. Results: IPAQ-SF sitting time scores were consistently and moderately correlated with all of the sedentary behavior metrics from the accelerometer (range of r between .295 and .431), and the correlations were stronger than those between self-reported physical activity and sedentary metrics from the accelerometer (range of r between -.087 and .163). The correlations between IPAQ-SF sitting time scores with the accelerometer-derived sedentary behavior metrics were still statistically significant in the analyses controlling for physical activity (range of parametric correlations between .281 and .411). Conclusions: The correlation analysis indicated consistent, moderate correlations between IPAQ-SF sitting time scores and device-measured estimates of both the volume and pattern of sedentary behavior, and the correlations were (a) stronger than those for self-reported physical activity and (b) independent of self-reported physical activity.

Despite the considerable health benefits of PA in this population there is a paucity of validated self-report measures of PA. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire short-form (IPAQ-s) is a self-report tool commonly used in healthcare settings to assess PA. However, its validity has not yet been investigated in people with MS. The aim of this study was to examine the validity of the IPAQ-s compared with an objective measure in assessing light and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in people with MS. Methods: Fifty-eight people with MS (67% female, mean ± SD age 57.8 ± 11.1 yr, 73.2% EDSS > 4.5) wore an Actigraph wGT3X-BT accelerometer for seven days and completed the IPAQ-s. Mean difference in light PA and MVPA between the IPAQ-s and accelerometer was determined using paired t-tests. Agreement was determined by calculating Bland-Altman limits of agreement. Linear regression analysis was used to determine if EDSS score was associated with the difference between self-report and objectively measured light PA and MVPA, respectively. Results: There was a significant difference in mean time spent engaged in light PA [mean diff, 106.3 min (95% CI −127.3 to −85.3; p < 0.001)]. Upper and lower 95% limits of agreement for light PA were 11.7 to 273.5 min. There was no evidence of a difference between the two measures for time spent in MVPA [mean diff, 0.46 min (95% CI–8.0 to 8.9; p = 0.914)]. Upper and lower 95% limits of agreement for MVPA were −62.6 to 63.5 min. There was no evidence that EDSS score was associated with the difference between self-reported and objectively measured LPA or MVPA (p = 0.226 and p = 0.410, respectively). Conclusion(s): In a sample of people with MS self-reported light PA using the IPAQ-s was significantly lower compared to objectively measured activity levels. There was no significant difference in the amount of time engaged in MVPA using both measures. EDSS score did not predict difference between self-reported and objectively measured activity. Agreement between the IPAQ-s and accelerometer was poor for both light PA and MVPA in this sample of people with MS as demonstrated by the large limits of agreement. Implications: In people with MS PA is often determined by means of subjective reporting. The results suggest that the IPAQ-s should be used with caution when assessing levels of light PA and MVPA in this population. Objective PA measurements by accelerometer are necessary to determine accurate levels of PA in this population.

Participants (n = 63 [15M and 48F], age: 56.6 ± 7.3 years) wore an accelerometer on the hip for a 7-day period and completed the MSQ. Sedentary behaviour (SB) estimates were computed as min/day for both the MSQ and accelerometer. Associations between the two methods were examined using the Pearson correlation and agreement was assessed using a Bland-Altman plot. A linear prediction model was developed to improve the accuracy of the MSQ estimates using a selection of predictor variables routinely collected in MS research. There was a moderate correlation between MSQ and accelerometer SB estimates (r = 0.34, p < 0.01). The Bland-Altman plot indicated that the MSQ overestimated SB (mean bias: 80.54 min/day, 95% limits of agreement: -410.5 to 571.5 min/day).

Inertial measurement units (IMUs) are small, light wearable sensors that can be used in routine neurological practice. InertiaLocoGraphy (ILG), the quantification of gait with IMUs, has proven useful to detect early changes in MS undetectable with standard stopwatch-timed measures. Still, whether such markers are useful for evaluating the severity of the disease remains unknown. Therefore, the correlation between ILG and disease progression would be worth exploring. Methods: We will search MEDLINE via PubMed, Cochrane, and EMBASE electronic databases to identify articles published before May 2, 2018 that measure gait using IMUs in MS patients. In addition, grey literature will be searched. Inclusion criteria will be adults with a clinical diagnosis of MS and gait measured by using inertial sensors. We will exclude from the meta-analysis articles that do not provide sufficient data for evaluating the correlations between ILG parameters and disease severity as measured by at least one of the six following tests: the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), the Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale-12 (MSWS), the Multiple Sclerosis Severity Score (MSSS), the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29), the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC), and the Timed 25-ft Walk Test (T25FW). Extracted data from included articles will be presented descriptively, and effect sizes will be computed based on the recommendations from the Cochrane Collaboration handbook and RevMan software. Discussion: Identifying changes in disease state throughout the course of MS is essential for optimal care. Current clinical and performance tests allow for identifying advanced gait alteration but lack sensitivity to detect subtle gait change. IMUs can be easily used in clinical practice to quantify gait in MS patients. Nevertheless, whether these outcomes are clinically relevant is uncertain because no study has evaluated their correlation with disease severity across different settings. This systematic review and meta-analysis would bring insight into the potential of this outcome as a marker of disease evolution.

Lab assessments provide only a brief snapshot of a person's biomechanics that may not reflect gait in daily life. Wearable inertial sensors may enable ecologically valid measurements, but their relationship to lab-based measurements and indices of disorder severity have not been explored in PwMS. Objectives: Compare accelerometer-derived gait characteristics from walking outside of the lab to lab-based gait testing and to examine their relationship with indices of disorder severity. Methods: Ten PwMS (EDSS 1.0-5.0) performed in-lab walking tests at self-selected normal and fast speeds with wearable accelerometers secured to the thigh and chest. Sensors continuously recorded data for two days at home and a statistical classification model was used to identify walking bouts during daily life. Acceleration data from one of the walking intervals at home (NH) and from the fast (FL) and normal (NL) walking trials in the lab were segmented into strides normalized temporally. Peak longitudinal thigh acceleration (), peak chest acceleration magnitude (), and stride time () were extracted from each stride. One-way ANOVA compared, and from each walking condition (FL, NL, NH) for each subject. Correlation coefficients were determined between indices of disorder severity and the mean and variance of and for each walking condition, the total time-series variance of each acceleration trace, and the time-series similarity between average acceleration traces for the FL and NL trials. Results: Subject-specific ANOVAs revealed subject dependent significant differences between, and for lab-based observations and between lab and home observations. Significant correlations were observed between indices of disorder severity and 11 of the accelerometer-based metrics from all walking conditions (two of which were identified in the home, but not in the lab), and between maximum walking speed and average daily walking duration. Conclusion: Gait characterization by accelerometer derived metrics may indicate disorder severity in PwMS. Lab-based gait observations may be different than in daily life warranting further development of wearable-sensor based gait assessments in the home to better understand the relationship between assessment outcomes and fall risk.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458519843084","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458519843084&atitle=Wearable+sensor-based+characterization+of+gait+biomechanics+in+persons+with+multiple+sclerosis%3A+Comparing+in-lab+and+daily+life+observations&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=25&issue=&spage=30&epage=31&aulast=Gurchiek&aufirst=Reed+D.&auinit=R.D.&aufull=Gurchiek+R.D.&coden=&isbn=&pages=30-31&date=2019&auinit1=R&auinitm=D","Embase"

Background: Variations of different walking parameters such as step length, cadence, step width, step angle, step time, joint angles, muscle force and many others can be estimated with inertial sensor-based systems or wearable systems. Perception Neuron (PN) is a commercial device containing 32 sensors each composed of a 3-axis gyroscope, accelerometer and magnetometer. Data obtained from the sensors have high statistical complexity. Assuming deterministic behavior of the system where newly obtained data follow governing laws and therefore do not carry any novel information, we used Learning entropy (LE), which is a method of adaptive monitoring of dynamical systems, to quantify the degree of gait incoordination. Design/Methods: Seven ataxic patients with MS and 7 healthy controls were recorded using PN while walking. As the adaptive model input, the values recorded by 32 three-axis accelerometers were used. The predicted value was path length of the accelerometer to the next measurement. Normalized Least-mean-squares adaptive filter was used as the adaptive model. After estimating entropy from 32 sensors, its mean value and standard deviation were calculated. Support vector machine (SVM) was used for the classification of walking irregularities in patients with MS and healthy controls. The cross-validated SVM classifier was optimized using Bayesian optimization. The radial basis kernel function was selected for separation of the data. Parameters for balancing the error and margin width were optimized by quadratic programming. Results: Accuracy of discrimination between the two groups was 0.79. Conclusions: Incoordination of gait in patients with multiple sclerosis can be quantified by Learning entropy. The prediction error of the model is probably due to the inability of patients to reproduce the optimal walking stereotype.","Conference Abstract",NA,"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=1526632X&id=doi:&atitle=Wearable+sensors+for+evaluation+gait+disorder+in+ms+estimated+by+learning+entropy&stitle=Neurology&title=Neurology&volume=92&issue=15&spage=&epage=&aulast=Dostal&aufirst=Ondrej&auinit=O.&aufull=Dostal+O.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2019&auinit1=O&auinitm=","Embase"

Although wearables represent promising tools also in multiple sclerosis (MS), the research on their application in MS is still ongoing and further studies are required to assess their reliability and accuracy to monitor body functions and disability in people with MS (pwMS). Previous findings within this field could be classified into macrocategories, considered crucial for disease management: assessment, monitoring, intervention, advice and education.

Background: Quantitative gait analysis supports diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders. Technological approaches differ, and there is uncertainty about comparability of derived parameters. Methods: Patients with Parkinson Disease (PwPD, N=9, f:4, MDSUPDRS III: 23.25 (+-11.9)) and Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS, N=19, f:8, EDSS: 3.2 (+-1.4)), and healthy subjects (HC, N=24, f:12) were recorded with two different gait analysis systems. Wearable sensors (MoL; Mobility Lab, APDM) recorded subjects waking 7m back and forth in comfortable and maximum speed. With same speed instructions, very short walks (<3.5m) towards a 3D camera using marker-less visual-perceptive motion capture (VPC; Motognosis Labs using Microsoft Kinect V2) were performed. For comfortable speed walk, gait speed, stride length and cadence were derived from both systems, whereas for maximum speed walk, only gait speed was used. Independent t-test and Cohen's D were used to determine disease effects against HC. Agreement between both systems were described by Spearman's Rho. Results: Both systems showed good correlations with lowest in comfortable gait speed in HC (rho=.68) and highest in maximum gait speed in PwMS (rho=.s87). In PwMS, comfortable speed walk, gait speed and cadence were lower than in HC for VPC (gait speed∗ D:-.96; cadence∗ D:-1.03), but not for MoL.

The IMUs measured linear and rotational movements of 37 schoolchildren, 7-10yo, 17 patients and 20 control subjects, during the execution of motor exercises, performed under medical and psychiatric supervision, to assess different aspects of the motor coordination. The measured motor parameters showed a high degree of significance in discriminating the ADHD/DCD patients from the healthy subjects, pointing out which motor tasks are worth focusing on.

Impaired ambulation results in loss of independence. Current approaches to document disease impact/progression on ambulation including EDSS/T25FW are insufficiently sensitive to quantify subtle but critical change. Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) for gait relate to several critical elements of the gait cycle beyond velocity. Earlier recognition of critical change might improve disease modifying therapy choice and timing of change. Objective multi-dimensional analytics have included digital devices of varying types utilizing different technologies (e.g. foot pressure, accelerometer, 3D video capture). Comparing different technologies in people with MS (PwMS) along a spectrum of disability would be important to optimal technology choice. Simultaneous comparisons of similar outcome measures of gait components would enhance technology choice. Objectives: To compare and contrast quantified outcome measures of the gait cycle as measured by the use of three different validated and digital ambulatory devices. Methods: PwMS performed one pass (20 feet) while ambulating at a preferred walking speed along the Zeno™ walkway (ZW, ProtoKinetics), while wearing Opal sensors (OS, APDM), and captured using VSTBalance (VB, VirtuSense) simultaneously. Relevant gait parameters (GP) captured: velocity, stride length, total double support, and cadence. Univariate regression modeling and T-tests were used for statistical analysis for each GP. Results: 9 PwMS (69% female, average age =53.1±11.8 years). Regression modeling showed the following relationships: velocity: ZWvsVB (r2 =0.93, p=1.2E-25), ZWvsOS (r2 =0.99, p=6.9E-40), VBvsOS (r2 =0.96, p=1.8E-25) Stride Length: ZWvsVB (r2 =0.32, p=7.8E-25), ZWvsOS (r2 =0.9, p=1.02E-16), VBvsOS (r2 =0.30, p=1.3E-4).

Diagnosis of MS typically involves a combination of complex clinical assessments and tests to rule out other diseases with similar symptoms. New technologies, such as smartphone monitoring in free-living conditions, could potentially aid in objectively assessing the symptoms of MS by quantifying symptom presence and intensity over long periods of time. Here, we present a deep-learning approach to diagnosing MS from smartphone-derived digital biomarkers that uses a novel combination of a multilayer perceptron with neural soft attention to improve learning of patterns in long-term smartphone monitoring data. Using data from a cohort of 774 participants, we demonstrate that our deep-learning models are able to distinguish between people with and without MS with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.70, 0.88).

Traditional clinical assessments of MS-related disability, such as the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), largely rely on subjective measurements of disability. Objectively-measured activity using accelerometry in a freeliving environment could offer new insights into tracking disease progression. Objectives: To quantify actigraphy-derived measures and to evaluate if these measures can reliably predict subsequent EDSSconfirmed disability and disability progression in people with MS. Methods: People with MS (n=64) provided information on demographic and clinical characteristics and wore an accelerometer for 2 weeks following a neurological exam and assessment of walking speed. A subgroup of participants (n=50) were followed longitudinally and asked to wear an accelerometer every 3 months for a 1-year period. Longitudinal study participants had a follow-up neurological exam after 1 year. For cross-sectional analyses, we assessed whether overall activity and time-period-specific activity were associated with EDSS scores using linear regression and novel functional regression models, also adjusting for age, sex and body mass index. For longitudinal analyses, we assessed whether change in either overall activity or activity variability predicts change in EDSS scores. Results: Continuous activity monitoring is able to detect differences in patients with MS with varied EDSS scores. Functional models identified significant time periods reflecting differences in disability levels; differences in afternoon/evening activity (12:00- 21:00) were highly associated with EDSS with the greatest significance between 16:00 and 20:00 (p<0.001). Lower morning (6:00-8:00) and evening (18:00-20:00) activity were associated with slower walking speeds. Longitudinal analyses are ongoing; however, preliminary data demonstrate that patients whose EDSS worsened over the course of the year had different actigraphy patterns than others. Conclusions: We observed differences in objectively-measured activity at distinct time periods that were associated with EDSS and walking speed. Novel analytic methods that consider activity over the course of a 24-hour period may provide unique insight into monitoring disability in MS. Follow-up analyses applying these methods will evaluate 24-hour activity patterns as it relates to future EDSS scores, although early results show great promises.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458520917096","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458520917096&atitle=A+longitudinal+study+of+objectively-measured+physical+activity+patterns+in+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=26&issue=1+SUPPL&spage=25&epage=&aulast=Tian&aufirst=F.&auinit=F.&aufull=Tian+F.&coden=&isbn=&pages=25-&date=2020&auinit1=F&auinitm=","Embase"

For example, an increase of the concentration of circulating miR-17 has been linked to lung cancer and metastatic breast cancer, while its decrease has been found in multiple sclerosis and gastric cancer. Consequently, techniques for the fast, specific and simple quantitation of microRNAs are becoming crucial enablers of early diagnosis and therapeutic follow-up. DNA based biosensors can serve this purpose, overcoming some of the drawbacks of conventional lab-based techniques. Herein, we report a cost-effective, simple and robust biosensor based on localized surface plasmon resonance and hybridization chain reaction. Immobilized gold nanoparticles are used for the detection of miR-17. Specificity of the detection was achieved by the use of hairpin surface-tethered probes and the hybridization chain reaction was used to amplify the detection signal and thus extend the dynamic range of the quantitation. Less than 1 h is needed for the entire procedure that achieved a limit of detection of about 1 pM or 50 amol/measurement, well within the reported useful range for diagnostic applications. We suggest that this technology could be a promising substitute of traditional lab-based techniques for the detection and quantification of miRNAs after these are extracted from diagnostic specimens and their analysis is thus made possible.","Article","10.1016/J.BIOS.2020.112465","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=18734235&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.bios.2020.112465&atitle=A+miRNA+biosensor+based+on+localized+surface+plasmon+resonance+enhanced+by+surface-bound+hybridization+chain+reaction&stitle=Biosens.+Bioelectron.&title=Biosensors+and+Bioelectronics&volume=167&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Miti&aufirst=Andrea&auinit=A.&aufull=Miti+A.&coden=BBIOE&isbn=&pages=-&date=2020&auinit1=A&auinitm=","Embase"

Identifying potential fallers and giving them proper attention could reduce their chance of a fall that results in severe injuries and decreased quality of life. In this study, we introduced a novel approach for fall risk prediction that evaluates Short-form Berg Balance Scale scores via inertial measurement unit data measured from a 3-meter timed-up-and-go test. This approach used sensor technology and was thus easy to implement, and allowed a quantitative analysis of both gait and balance. The results showed that elastic net logistic regression achieved the best performance with 85% accuracy and 88% area under the curve compared with support vector machine, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and stepwise logistic regression. This paper provides a framework for using sensor-based features together with a feature-selection strategy for screening and predicting the fall risk of post-stroke patients in a convenient setup with high accuracy. The findings of this study will not only enable the assessment of fall risk among post-stroke patients in a cost-effective manner but also provide decision-making support for community care providers and medical professionals in the form of sensor-based data on gait performance.","Article","10.1109/JSEN.2020.2987623","WOS:000550685000050","WoS"

The University of California San Francisco MS BioScreen is a web-based precision medicine tool initially designed to be clinician facing. We aimed to design a second, openly available tool, Open MS BioScreen, that would be accessible, understandable, and actionable by people with MS. Objective: This study aimed to describe the human-centered design and development approach (inspiration, ideation, and implementation) for creating the Open MS BioScreen platform. Methods: We planned an iterative and cyclical development process that included stakeholder engagement and iterative feedback from users. Stakeholders included patients with MS along with their caregivers and family members, MS experts, generalist clinicians, industry representatives, and advocacy experts. Users consisted of anyone who wants to track MS measurements over time and access openly available tools for people with MS. Phase I (inspiration) consisted of empathizing with users and defining the problem. We sought to understand the main challenges faced by patients and clinicians and what they would want to see in a web-based app. In phase II (ideation), our multidisciplinary team discussed approaches to capture, display, and make sense of user data. Then, we prototyped a series of mock-ups to solicit feedback from clinicians and people with MS. In phase III (implementation), we incorporated all concepts to test and iterate a minimally viable product. We then gathered feedback through an agile development process. The design and development were cyclical—many times throughout the process, we went back to the drawing board. Results: This human-centered approach generated an openly available, web-based app through which patients with MS, their clinicians, and their caregivers can access the site and create an account. Users can enter information about their MS (basic level as well as more advanced concepts), visualize their data longitudinally, access a series of algorithms designed to empower them to make decisions about their treatments, and enter data from wearable devices to encourage realistic goal setting about their ambulatory activity. Agile development will allow us to continue to incorporate precision medicine tools, as these are validated in the clinical research arena. Conclusions: After engaging intended users into the iterative human-centered design of the Open MS BioScreen, we will now monitor the adaptation and dissemination of the tool as we expand its functionality and reach. The insights generated from this approach can be applied to the development of a number of self-tracking, self-management, and user engagement tools for patients with chronic conditions.","Article","10.2196/15605","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14388871&id=doi:10.2196%2F15605&atitle=A+precision+medicine+tool+for+patients+with+multiple+sclerosis+%28the+open+ms+bioscreen%29%3A+Human-centered+design+and+development&stitle=J.+Med.+Internet+Res.&title=Journal+of+Medical+Internet+Research&volume=22&issue=7&spage=&epage=&aulast=Schleimer&aufirst=Erica&auinit=E.&aufull=Schleimer+E.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2020&auinit1=E&auinitm=","Embase"

Digital health technology, including body-worn devices, offers a solution using digital outcomes to measure and monitor disease status and provide outcomes meaningful to both patients and health care professionals. Remote monitoring of physical mobility is a prime example, because mobility is among the most advanced modalities that can be assessed digitally and remotely. Loss of mobility is also an important feature of many health conditions, providing a read-out of health as well as a target for intervention. Real-world, continuous digital measures of mobility (digital mobility outcomes or DMOs) provide an opportunity for novel insights into health care conditions complementing existing mobility measures. Accepted and approved DMOs are not yet widely available. The need for large collaborative efforts to tackle the critical steps to adoption is widely recognised. Mobilise-D is an example. It is a multidisciplinary consortium of 34 institutions from academia and industry funded through the European Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 Joint Undertaking. Members of Mobilise-D are collaborating to address the critical steps for DMOs to be adopted in clinical trials and ultimately health care. To achieve this, the consortium has developed a roadmap to inform the development, validation and approval of DMOs in Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and recovery from proximal femoral fracture. Here we aim to describe the proposed approach and provide a high-level view of the ongoing and planned work of the Mobilise-D consortium. Ultimately, Mobilise-D aims to stimulate widespread adoption of DMOs through the provision of device agnostic software, standards and robust validation in order to bring digital outcomes from concept to use in clinical trials and health care.","Article in Press","10.1159/000512513","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=2504110X&id=doi:10.1159%2F000512513&atitle=A+Roadmap+to+Inform+Development%2C+Validation+and+Approval+of+Digital+Mobility+Outcomes%3A+The+Mobilise-D+Approach&stitle=Digit.+Biomarkers&title=Digital+Biomarkers&volume=&issue=&spage=13&epage=27&aulast=Rochester&aufirst=Lynn&auinit=L.&aufull=Rochester+L.&coden=&isbn=&pages=13-27&date=2020&auinit1=L&auinitm=","Embase"

Accurate and repeatable measures of cognition have the potential to be used as markers of disease activity. Methods: We developed a 5-min computerized test to measure cognitive dysfunction in patients with MS. The proposed test - named the Integrated Cognitive Assessment (ICA) - is self-administered and language-independent. Ninety-one MS patients and 83 healthy controls (HC) took part in Substudy 1, in which each participant took the ICA test and the Brief International Cognitive Assessment for MS (BICAMS). We assessed ICA's test-retest reliability, its correlation with BICAMS, its sensitivity to discriminate patients with MS from the HC group, and its accuracy in detecting cognitive dysfunction. In Substudy 2, we recruited 48 MS patients, 38 of which had received an 8-week physical and cognitive rehabilitation programme and 10 MS patients who did not. We examined the association between the level of serum neurofilament light (NfL) in these patients and their ICA scores and Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) scores pre- and post-rehabilitation. Results: The ICA demonstrated excellent test-retest reliability (r = 0.94), with no learning bias, and showed a high level of convergent validity with BICAMS. The ICA was sensitive in discriminating the MS patients from the HC group, and demonstrated high accuracy (AUC = 95%) in discriminating cognitively normal from cognitively impaired participants. Additionally, we found a strong association (r = - 0.79) between ICA score and the level of NfL in MS patients before and after rehabilitation. Conclusions: The ICA has the potential to be used as a digital marker of cognitive impairment and to monitor response to therapeutic interventions. In comparison to standard cognitive tools for MS, the ICA is shorter in duration, does not show a learning bias, and is independent of language.","Article","10.1186/S12883-020-01736-X","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14712377&id=doi:10.1186%2Fs12883-020-01736-x&atitle=A+self-administered%2C+artificial+intelligence+%28AI%29+platform+for+cognitive+assessment+in+multiple+sclerosis+%28MS%29&stitle=BMC+Neurol.&title=BMC+Neurology&volume=20&issue=1&spage=&epage=&aulast=Khaligh-Razavi&aufirst=Seyed-Mahdi&auinit=S.-M.&aufull=Khaligh-Razavi+S.-M.&coden=BNMEC&isbn=&pages=-&date=2020&auinit1=S&auinitm=-M","Embase"

This is of paramount importance to develop tailored interventions aimed at preventing functional decline. Objective: To assess the discriminant ability of a quick instrumented balance test in early-stage, normally walking PwMS. Methods: Fifty-nine PwMS (age: 38.1±9.1years, EDSS<=2.5, disease duration<=5 years) and forty healthy subjects (HS, 38.9±10.9years) were recruited. PwMS were assessed for walking using Timed 25-foot Walk (T25FW), Timed Up-and-Go (TUG) tests, and IMU-derived features describing a 15-meter fast walking trial. Standing balance was assessed during Item7 of Fullerton Advanced Balance (FAB) scale. Participants stood upright with eyes closed on a foam pad for 30 seconds wearing an IMU at sternum level. The task was scored on a 5-point scale (0-4, 4: Normal performance), and with sensor-derived parameters describing trunk sway amplitude (SwayAmp), velocity (SwayVel), and sample entropy considered a regularity measure (SwaySaE). Results: T25FW (3.9±0.6 s) and TUG (6.9±1.2 s) scores were normal. All instrumented walking features (spatio-temporal, regularity, symmetry parameters) were comparable between groups (p>=0.17), indicating the absence of significant gait alterations in the recruited sample. FAB-Item7 score was 4 for all participants. Instrumented features showed in PwMS larger mediolateral SwayAmp (PwMS: 174±166 mm/s2; HS: 92±44 mm/s2;p=0.001), higher SwayVel (PwMS: 96±113 mm/s; HS: 47±39 mm/s;p=0.007), and lower SwaySaE (PwMS: 1.4±0.5; HS: 1.7±0.3;p=0.024) meaning higher regularity. 41% of PwMS showed at least one abnormal parameter. 14% showed abnormal values of all metrics. Conclusion: Compared to FAB-Item7 clinical score, IMU-derived features showed higher ability to discriminate early-stage, normally walking PwMS from HS. PwMS maintained balance with larger, faster, and more regular trunk sway. The latter result suggested a less automatic balance control. Future studies should test the reliability and clinical significance of the proposed indexes.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458520969077","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458520969077&atitle=A+single+wearable+inertial+sensor+detects+subtle+balance+impairments+in+early-stage%2C+normally+walking+people+with+Multiple+Sclerosis&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=26&issue=2+SUPPL&spage=24&epage=&aulast=Carpinella&aufirst=Ilaria&auinit=I.&aufull=Carpinella+I.&coden=&isbn=&pages=24-&date=2020&auinit1=I&auinitm=","Embase"

These changes in gait have been well studied in laboratory and clinical settings. A thorough investigation of gait alterations during community ambulation and their contributing factors, however, is lacking. The aim of the present study was to evaluate community ambulation and physical activity in pwMS and healthy controls and to compare in-lab gait to community ambulation. To this end, 104 subjects were studied: 44 pwMS and 60 healthy controls (whose age was similar to the controls). The subjects wore a tri-axial, lower back accelerometer during usual-walking and dual-task walking in the lab and during community ambulation (1 week) to evaluate the amount, type, and quality of activity. The results showed that during community ambulation, pwMS took fewer steps and walked more slowly, with greater asymmetry, and larger stride-to-stride variability, compared to the healthy controls (p < 0.001). Gait speed during most of community ambulation was significantly lower than the in-lab usual-walking value and similar to the in-lab dual-tasking value. Significant group (pwMS /controls)-by-walking condition (in-lab/community ambulation) interactions were observed (e.g., gait speed). Greater disability was associated with fewer steps and reduced gait speed during community ambulation. In contrast, physical fatigue was correlated with sedentary activity, but was not related to any of the measures of community ambulation gait quality including gait speed. This disparity suggests that more than one mechanism contributes to community ambulation and physical activity in pwMS. Together, these findings demonstrate that during community ambulation, pwMS have marked gait alterations in multiple gait features, reminiscent of dual-task walking measured in the laboratory. Disease-related factors associated with these changes might be targets of rehabilitation.","Article","10.1007/S00415-020-09759-7","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14321459&id=doi:10.1007%2Fs00415-020-09759-7&atitle=A+wearable+sensor+identifies+alterations+in+community+ambulation+in+multiple+sclerosis%3A+contributors+to+real-world+gait+quality+and+physical+activity&stitle=J.+Neurol.&title=Journal+of+Neurology&volume=267&issue=7&spage=1912&epage=1921&aulast=Shema-Shiratzky&aufirst=Shirley&auinit=S.&aufull=Shema-Shiratzky+S.&coden=JNRYA&isbn=&pages=1912-1921&date=2020&auinit1=S&auinitm=","Embase"

Methods The sample included 30 persons with mild-to-moderate PD (Hoehn and Yahr stages 2-3) and 30 adults without PD matched by sex and age. All participants completed 5 minutes of quiet, seated rest and then underwent three, 6-minute bouts of walking on a treadmill at three different speeds relative to the individual's self-selected pace. Activity counts were measured using an ActiGraph accelerometer worn at the waist level on the least affected side for persons with PD and the dominant side for controls. The rate of oxygen consumption, or energy expenditure, was measured using a portable, open-circuit spirometry system. Results Our results indicated a strong association between activity counts and energy expenditure for persons with PD (R-2 = 0.87) and controls (R-2 = 0.89). However, the significant difference in slopes resulted in a lower cut-point of 1,354 counts center dot min(-1) for persons with PD than the cut-point of 2,010 counts center dot min(-1) for controls. Conclusion Our results support the application of the disease-specific cut-point for quantifying the amount of time spent in MVPA using ActiGraph accelerometers among persons with mild-to-moderate PD. Such an application may provide accurate estimates of MVPA in this population, and better inform future research examining the possible determinants and consequences of physical activity as well as testing of interventions for changing MVPA in PD.","Article","10.1371/JOURNAL.PONE.0242136","WOS:000593946900009","WoS"

Methods: In a controlled observational, cross sectional study thirty subjects with cerebral palsy (CP), with level I&II of the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) and 30 healthy control children (Ctrl), aged 3–12 years, were asked to perform a 1-min-walking test (1 mwt) under laboratory conditions, and to wear an accelerometric device for a 1-week wearing home measurement (1 WHM). Acceptance was measured via wearing time, and by a questionnaire in which subjects rated restrictions in their daily living and wearing comfort. In addition, validity of 3D-accelerometric gait speed was checked through gold standard assessment of gait speed with a mobile perambulator. Results: Wearing time amounted to 10.3 (SD 3.4) hours per day, which was comparable between groups (T = 1.10, P = 0.3). Mode for wearing comfort [CP 1, Range (1,4), Ctrl 1, Range (1,6)] and restriction of daily living [CP 1, Range (1,3), Ctrl 1, Range (1,4)] was comparable between groups. Under laboratory conditions, Ctrl walked faster in the 1 mwt than CP (Ctrl 1.72 ± 0.29 m/s, CP 1.48 ± 0.41 m/s, P = 0.018). Similarly, a statistically significant difference was found when comparing real-world walking speed and laboratory walking speed (CP: 1 mwt 1.48 ± 0.41 m/s, 1 WHM 0.89 ± 0.09 m/s, P = 0.012; Ctrl: 1mwt 1.72 ± 0.29, 1 WHM 0.97 ± 0.06, P < 0.001). Conclusion: 3D-accelerometry is well-enough accepted in a pediatric population of patients with CP and a Ctrl group to allow valid assessments. Assessment outside the laboratory environment yields information about real world activity that was not captured by routine clinical tests. This suggests that assessment of habitual activities by wearable devices reflects the functioning of children in their home environment.

METHODOLOGY: We developed a full muscle driven simulator in an open source environment and validated it with real gait data obtained from patients diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. After that, we designed, modeled, and controlled a 6 DoF lower limb exoskeleton with inertial measurement units and a position/velocity sensor in each actuator. SIGNIFICANCE: This novel concept aims to become a tool for improving the diagnosis of pathological gait and to design personalized robotics rehabilitation therapies. CONCLUSION: ALICE is the first robotics platform automatically adapted to the kinetic and kinematic gait parameters of each patient.","Article","10.3390/S20030789","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14248220&id=doi:10.3390%2Fs20030789&atitle=ALICE%3A+Conceptual+Development+of+a+Lower+Limb+Exoskeleton+Robot+Driven+by+an+On-Board+Musculoskeletal+Simulator&stitle=Sensors+%28Basel%29&title=Sensors+%28Basel%2C+Switzerland%29&volume=20&issue=3&spage=&epage=&aulast=Cardona&aufirst=Manuel&auinit=M.&aufull=Cardona+M.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2020&auinit1=M&auinitm=","Embase"

Overground robotic (OR) wearable exoskeletons are promising tools for gait rehabilitation, but currently there is no evidence of their clinical effects on patients with MS. The present study aims to determine the effects of an OR intervention in people with MS and moderate to severe walking disabilities and ascertain if benefits are maintained over a follow-up period of 3 months. This randomized controlled trial will include 36 participants with MS. Inclusion criteria are: Older than 18 years, definitive diagnosis of MS, 4.5-7 points on the EDSS (Expanded Disability Status Scale), and needing one or two canes or crutches for walking outdoors. Subjects in the control group will receive conventional physiotherapy sessions at ADEMBI (Asociación de Esclerosis Múltiple de Bizkaia) provided to control spasticity, maintain articular range and exercise balance. Subjects in the intervention group will receive the same physiotherapy but also participate in a progressive OR gait training program assisted by the EksoTM exoskeleton. The program consists of twice a week individually supervised sessions in two setting modalities: PreGait and ProStepPlus. The training parameters (duration, speed, cadence, length of steps) will be set during the first session and the progression and intensity of the intervention will be adapted to the tolerance of each participant. The primary outcome of this study is gait speed. Secondary outcomes will include physical and cognitive performance tests, clinical, fatigue and quality of life assessments, and changes in the plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines. The present trial is the first analyzing the effectiveness of an OR intervention for gait training in patients with MS. It will help clarify the applicability of robotic technologies to clinical practice, extending the functionality and quality of life of people with MS to face a successful aging process.

A major limitation in fall detection algorithm development is an absence of real-world falls data. Fall detection algorithms are typically trained on simulated fall data that contain a well-balanced number of examples of falls and activities of daily living. However, real-world falls occur infrequently, making them difficult to capture and causing severe data imbalance. People with multiple sclerosis (MS) fall frequently, and their risk of falling increases with disease progression. Because of their high fall incidence, people with MS provide an ideal model for studying falls. This paper describes the development of a context-aware fall detection system based on inertial sensors and time of flight sensors that is robust to imbalance, which is trained and evaluated on real-world falls in people with MS. The algorithm uses an auto-encoder that detects fall candidates using reconstruction error of accelerometer signals followed by a hyper-ensemble of balanced random forests trained using both acceleration and movement features. On a clinical dataset obtained from 25 people with MS monitored over eight weeks during free-living conditions, 54 falls were observed and our system achieved a sensitivity of 92.14%, and false-positive rate of 0.65 false alarms per day.","Article in Press","10.1109/JBHI.2020.3041035","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=21682208&id=doi:10.1109%2FJBHI.2020.3041035&atitle=Automated+Detection+of+Real-World+Falls%3A+Modeled+from+People+with+Multiple+Sclerosis&stitle=IEEE+J.+Biomedical+Health+Informat.&title=IEEE+Journal+of+Biomedical+and+Health+Informatics&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Mosquera-Lopez&aufirst=Clara&auinit=C.&aufull=Mosquera-Lopez+C.&coden=ITIBF&isbn=&pages=-&date=2020&auinit1=C&auinitm=","Embase"

While physical rehabilitation has been identified as one of the best methods for restoring function in MS[2], it can be challenging to implement in individuals with severe impaired mobility. One approach is the use of a novel assistive device such as a wearable Robotic exoskeletons (RE). REs have been increasingly used to provide gait rehabilitation for persons with mobility disorders (e.g. spinal cord injury and stroke) [3-7], and more recently for persons with MS[8, 9]. The current study examines potential improvements in mobility, cognitive processing speed, as well as resting-state (RS) functional connectivity of the brain in persons with MS through the use of RE. Objectives: To determine if gait training using RE improves mobility, cognition, and brain RS functional connectivity in persons with MS. Methods: Four persons with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) participated in this randomized pilot prospective study. Two MS patients received eight 1-hour RE training sessions (Ekso-GT, Ekso Bionics, Berkley, CA, USA) administered by a licensed physical therapist; the other two participants received eight 1-hour Conventional Gait Therapy (CGT) sessions. The 8-seesion interventions occurred over a four week period (2 sessions/ week). The Six Minute Walk Test (6MWT), Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), and RS functional MRI (fMRI) of the brain, acquired using a Siemens Skyra 3 Tesla MRI scanner were assessed at baseline and after the 4-week intervention. A seed-based RS functional connectivity analysis approach was used, with seeds placed in the motor and ventromedial prefrontal cortices (vmPFC). Results: The RE group improved by 21% in walking distance in the 6MWT while the CGT group showed essentially no change (a 2% decrease in the distance). The RE group also showed improvements in SDMT performance (Z(RE) = 0.95; Z(CGT) = - 0.78), as well as improvements in functional connectivity in the motor cortex (Z(RE) = 0.8; Z(CGT) = - 0.08) and in the vmPFC (Z(RE) = 0.8; Z(CGT) = -0.003). Conclusions: Improvements in mobility, cognitive processing speed, and resting state functional connectivity in the motor cortex and in the vmPFC were observed for participants in the RE gait training group but not in the CGT group. These pilot results suggest that gait training using RE can be an effective therapy for improving walking ability, cognitive function, and brain connectivity in resting-state networks in persons with MS. Data analysis of a larger sample is underway to confirm the findings.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458520974938","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458520974938&atitle=Changes+in+mobility+and+brain+connectivity+following+over-ground+robotic+exoskeleton+rehabilitation+in+persons+with+MS&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=26&issue=3+SUPPL&spage=74&epage=&aulast=Niewrzol&aufirst=P.&auinit=P.&aufull=Niewrzol+P.&coden=&isbn=&pages=74-&date=2020&auinit1=P&auinitm=","Embase"

Methods: twenty-three subjects with CP and 23 controls, aged between 4 and 14 years, were evaluated on two occasions, separated by 3 to 5 days. An IMU and a Cervical Range of Motion device (CROM) were used to assess craniocervical ROM in the three spatial planes. Validity was assessed by comparing IMU and CROM data using the Pearson correlation coefficient, the paired t-test and Bland-Altman plots. Intra-day and inter-day relative reliability were determined using the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC). The Standard Error of Measurement (SEM) and the Minimum Detectable Change at a 90% confidence level (MDC90) were obtained for absolute reliability. Results: High correlations were detected between methods in both groups on the sagittal and frontal planes (r > 0.9), although this was reduced in the case of the transverse plane. Bland-Altman plots indicated bias below 5 degrees, although for the range of cervical rotation in the CP group, this was 8.2 degrees. The distance between the limits of agreement was over 23.5 degrees in both groups, except for the range of flexion-extension in the control group. ICCs were higher than 0.8 for both comparisons and groups, except for inter-day comparisons of rotational range in the CP group. Absolute reliability showed high variability, with most SEM below 8.5 degrees, although with worse inter-day results, mainly in CP subjects, with the MDC90 of rotational range achieving more than 20 degrees. Conclusions: IMU application is highly correlated with CROM for the assessment of craniocervical movement in CP and healthy subjects; however, both methods are not interchangeable. The IMU error of measurement can be considered clinically acceptable; however, caution should be taken when this is used as a reference measure for interventions.","Article","10.3390/DIAGNOSTICS10020080","WOS:000519541300015","WoS"

Background: Efforts to mitigate the loss of mobility in Parkinson's disease (PD) are an increasing priority and promising interventions to investigate this aspect are now under investigation. To target mobility loss effectively and to be able to prevent it, validated tools that can detect and measure it in daily life are needed. Digital technologies have the potential for measuring and monitoring digital mobility outcomes in real life, but to date, no robust and well-validated solutions for the assessment of mobility in PD patients are available. Methods: The overarching aims of Mobilise-D (“Connecting digital mobility assessment to clinical outcomes for regulatory and clinical endorsement”) are to: 1) provide a valid solution for real-life digital mobility assessment; 2) validate digital mobility outcomes in predicting clinical outcome in a variety of disease states including PD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, multiple sclerosis, and proximal femoral fracture; and 3) obtain regulatory and health stakeholder approval for mobility assessment parameters derived from digital, wearable technology. Results: Mobilise-D is a 50 million Euro project funded by the European Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 Joint Undertaking. It includes 34 partners from leading international universities and some of the world's largest pharmaceutical and technical companies. The project began in April 2019 and will run for five years. The focus will be on assessment of real-world walking speed and related outcomes in 5 chronic disease populations to derive a device-agnostic algorithm that can be used to predict medically relevant clinical outcomes (e.g., falls, hospitalizations, disability, death) from mobility assessment. Additional measures of mobility and disability will be collected. Conclusions: The aim of Mobilise-D is to facilitate drug development and establish a roadmap for the clinical implementation of new, complementary tools to identify, stratify and monitor disability associated with mobility-limiting chronic diseases, including PD, with a focus on realworld walking speed.

It has been demonstrated that suitable job accommodation plans play a beneficial role in the overall quality of life of pathological subjects. A well-designed return-to-work program should consider several recent innovations in the clinical and ergonomic fields. One of the instrument-based methods used to monitor the effectiveness of ergonomic interventions is surface electromyography (sEMG), a multi-channel, non-invasive, wireless, wearable tool, which allows in-depth analysis of motor coordination mechanisms. Although the scientific literature in this field is extensive, its use remains significantly underexploited and the state-of-the-art technology lags expectations. This is mainly attributable to technical and methodological (electrode-skin impedance, noise, electrode location, size, configuration and distance, presence of crosstalk signals, comfort issues, selection of appropriate sensor setup, sEMG amplitude normalization, definition of correct sEMG-related outcomes and normative data) and cultural limitations. The technical and methodological problems are being resolved or minimized also thanks to the possibility of using reference books and tutorials.

As the monitoring and treatment of MS become more personalized and complex, the individual assessment and collection of different parameters ranging from clinical assessments via laboratory and imaging data to patient-reported data become increasingly important for innovative patient management in MS. These aspects predestine electronic data processing for use in MS documentation. Such technologies enable the rapid exchange of health information between patients, practitioners, and caregivers, regardless of time and location. In this perspective paper, we present our digital strategy from Dresden, where we are developing the Multiple Sclerosis Documentation System (MSDS) into an eHealth platform that can be used for multiple purposes. Various use cases are presented that implement this software platform and offer an important perspective for the innovative digital patient management in the future.

The Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse in the Central Nervous System (RADAR-CNS) study is a pan-European consortium aimed to improve the management of different CNS disorders such as MS, Epilepsy or Major Depression using smartphones and wearable devices. Most of the available data are based in small monocentric studies, however the full validation of these digital devices requires multicenter, well designed studies providing information on feasibility and acceptability. Objectives: We aimed to describe the outcomes of the recruitment process in the Multiple Sclerosis (MS) RADAR-CNS disability and fatigue study (D&F). Methods: The study was run in three European centers. Main eligibility criteria for D&F study were patients with relapsing-reminting or secondary progressive MS with an EDSS score between 2.0 and 6.0. Passive and active data were continuously collected through wearables (FitBit) and mobile phones (Android) and compared to the on-site visit every 3 months. The study duration is 2 years. The study sample size was 400 patients. Results: The enrolment of the D&F study extended for a period of 18 months. We identified 4094 potential candidates (min-max 885-1789). At the end of the recruitment period, 678 (16.6%; minmax 0-24.2%) remained in the pre-screening phase. 3416 (minmax 885-1454) patients were assessed for eligibility. Out of those, 2372 (69.4%; min-max 53.3-87.1%) were excluded for not fulfilling the eligibility criteria: 1520 (64.1%; 15.0-87.1%) did not meet the EDSS score, 254 (10.7%; 0.2-49.6%) would not be suitable in the investigators opinion and 598 (25.2%; 3.0-60.3) did not have an Android.

A total of 400 (90-162) patients, 9.8% of the potential candidates, were enrolled into the study. Conclusions: Our study illustrates the primary challenges in recruiting MS patients in RMT studies related to eligibility, both clinical and technological criteria, followed by reasons related to patients preferences. There is variability in the recruitment approach between centers. In future studies, developing technology for all types of phones and more attractive assessment for patients should be considered.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458520974937","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458520974937&atitle=Descriptive+study+on+recruitment+effort+for+a+remote+monitoring+study+in+multiple+sclerosis%3A+Radar+study&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=26&issue=3+SUPPL&spage=146&epage=147&aulast=Zabalza&aufirst=A.&auinit=A.&aufull=Zabalza+A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=146-147&date=2020&auinit1=A&auinitm=","Embase"

Methods: Twenty-four individuals with CP (4-14 years) and 24 gender- and age-matched controls were evaluated with a new test based on IMU technology to identify and measure any movement in the three spatial planes while the individual is seated watching a two-minute video. An ellipse was obtained encompassing 95% of the flexion/extension and rotation movements in the sagittal and transversal planes. The protocol was repeated on two occasions separated by 3 to 5 days. Construct and concurrent validity were assessed by determining the discriminant capacity of the new test and by identifying associations between functional measures and the new test outcomes. Relative reliability was determined using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for test-retest data. Absolute reliability was obtained by the standard error of measurement (SEM) and the Minimum Detectable Change at a 90% confidence level (MDC90). Results: The discriminant capacity of the area and both dimensions of the new test was high (Area Under the Curve approximate to 0.8), and consistent multiple regression models were identified to explain functional measures with new test results and sociodemographic data. A consistent trend of ICCs higher than 0.8 was identified for CP individuals. Finally, the SEM can be considered low in both groups, although the high variability among individuals determined some high MDC90 values, mainly in the CP group.

Ng A.","Determinants of low bone mineral density in people with multiple sclerosis: Role of physical activity","Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders",2020,"Background: People with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) have reduced bone mineral density (BMD), but the causes are unclear. Some factors that may cause reduced BMD in PwMS have been understudied, including physical activity, inflammation, cortisol, symptomatic fatigue, and depression. The aim of this study was to investigate factors that may uniquely contribute to reduced BMD in PwMS as compared to people without MS. We hypothesized that physical activity would be the primary determinant of low BMD in PwMS, with additional contributions from inflammation and sympathetic nervous system activation. Methods: We tested 23 PwMS (16 women; median EDSS: 2) and 22 control participants (16 women). BMD was measured from the femoral neck and lumbar spine with dual x-ray absorptiometry. Disability was measured with the Expanded Disability Status Scale, and functional capacity was measured with the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite. Questionnaires measured symptomatic fatigue and depression. A blood draw was used to measure calcium, phosphate, vitamin D, N-terminal telopeptide, osteopontin, and cytokine markers of inflammation. Physical activity was measured with accelerometry. Salivary cortisol and cardiac heart rate variability also were obtained. All outcome variables were compared between groups with independent samples t-tests. Variables that were different between groups and significantly correlated (Pearson product-moment) with femoral neck BMD, were included in a theoretical model to explain femoral neck BMD. The expected direction of relations in the theoretical model were developed based upon the results of previous research. A Bayesian path analysis was used to test the relations of predictive variables with femoral neck BMD and interrelations among predictive variables, as detailed in the theoretical model. Results: PwMS had lower BMD at the femoral neck than controls (p = =0.04; mean difference: -0.09; 95% CI: -0.2, -0.004; Cohen's d = =0.65), and there was a smaller, statistically non-significant difference in BMD at the lumbar spine (p = =0.07; mean difference: -0.08; 95% CI: -0.17, 0.007; Cohen's d = =0.59). PwMS also had lower functional capacity (p ≤ 0.001; Cohen's d = =1.50), greater fatigue (p<0.001; Cohen's d = =1.88), greater depression (p<0.001; d = =1.31), and decreased physical activity (p = =0.03; Cohen's d = =0.62). Using path analysis to test our theoretical model, we found that disability (standardized estimate= -0.17), physical activity (standardized estimate=0.39), symptomatic fatigue (standardized estimate= -0.36), depression (standardized estimate= -0.30), and inflammatory markers (standardized estimate=0.27) explained 51% of the variance in femoral neck BMD. Inflammatory markers were also predictive of disability (standardized estimate=0.44) and physical activity (standardized estimate= -0.40). Symptomatic fatigue and depression were correlated (r = =0.64). Conclusion: Physical activity, symptomatic fatigue, depression, disability, and inflammation all contributed independently to decreased femoral neck BMD in PWMS. Bone metabolism in PwMS is complex. Efforts to increase physical activity and address symptomatic fatigue and depression may improve bone mineral density in PwMS. Future research should investigate the mechanisms through which symptomatic fatigue and depression contribute to reduced BMD in PwMS.","Article","10.1016/J.MSARD.2019.101864","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=22110356&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.msard.2019.101864&atitle=Determinants+of+low+bone+mineral+density+in+people+with+multiple+sclerosis%3A+Role+of+physical+activity&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+Relat.+Disord.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+and+Related+Disorders&volume=38&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Cleland&aufirst=Brice+T.&auinit=B.T.&aufull=Cleland+B.T.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2020&auinit1=B&auinitm=T","Embase"

However, one overarching limitation of this research is that researchers have not recruited samples who have the actual problem of being studied (i.e., cognitive processing speed impairment). This study examined associations between device-measured PA and cognitive processing speed in a large sample of persons with MS overall and between those with and without cognitive processing speed impairment. METHOD: Three hundred eighty-five persons with MS underwent the oral Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) and wore an accelerometer for 7 days for PA measurement. We divided the overall sample into subsamples with (n = 140) and without (n = 245) cognitive processing speed impairment based on age, sex, and education-adjusted SDMT Z-scores. RESULTS: After controlling for age and disability status, higher levels of device-measured PA were significantly associated with faster cognitive processing speed overall, and the association was significantly stronger among persons with MS who presented with cognitive processing speed impairment. CONCLUSIONS: This examination provides initial cross-sectional support for informing the development of PA interventions as a possible approach for managing MS-related cognitive processing speed impairment. This highlights the importance of developing purposefully designed trials involving PA interventions for targeting cognitive processing speed as a primary end point among persons with MS with impaired cognitive processing speed.","Article","10.1017/S1355617720000284","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14697661&id=doi:10.1017%2FS1355617720000284&atitle=Device-Measured+Physical+Activity+and+Cognitive+Processing+Speed+Impairment+in+a+Large+Sample+of+Persons+with+Multiple+Sclerosis&stitle=J+Int+Neuropsychol+Soc&title=Journal+of+the+International+Neuropsychological+Society+%3A+JINS&volume=26&issue=8&spage=798&epage=805&aulast=Sandroff&aufirst=Brian+M.&auinit=B.M.&aufull=Sandroff+B.M.&coden=&isbn=&pages=798-805&date=2020&auinit1=B&auinitm=M","Embase"

Methods: We developed a smartphone application called MS Screen Test (MSST) to explore several dimensions of the neurological exam such as finger tapping speed, agility, hand synchronization, low contrast vision and cognition during a short evaluation. This app was tested on a cohort of healthy volunteers including a subset of subjects who underwent two evaluations on the same day to assess reproducibility. In a second step, the app was tested on a cohort of RIS subjects. Performances of RIS subjects were compared with age and genre-matched HC. Results: HC underwent two consecutive evaluations on MSST. The analysis showed good reproducibility for all measures. Then 21 RIS subjects were compared to 32 matched HC. Compared to HC, we found that RIS subjects had a lower finger tapping speed on the dominant hand (5.6 versus 6.5 taps per second; p = 0.005), a longer inter hand interval during the hand synchronization task (14.4 versus 11.3 ms; p = 0.03) and significantly poorer scores on the low contrast vision and cognition tests. Conclusion: MSST only requires a smartphone to obtain digital biomarkers relative to several dimensions of the neurological examination. Our results highlighted subtle differences between HC and RIS subjects.

However, little is known about the existence of possible differences in the way MS modifies the propensity to perform physical activity (PA) in men and women. The present study aimed to partly close this gap by means of quantitative analysis carried out using wearable sensors. Forty-five pwMS (23 F, 22 M, mean age 50.3) and 41 unaffected age-and sex-matched individuals wore a tri-axial accelerometer 24 h/day for 7 consecutive days. Raw data were processed to calculate average number of daily steps, vector magnitude (VM) counts, and percentage of time spent in sedentary behavior and in PA of different intensities (i.e., light and moderate-to-vigorous, MVPA). Women with MS spent more time in sedentary behavior and exhibited a reduced amount of light intensity activity with respect to men, while MVPA was similar across sexes. However, in comparison with unaffected individuals, the overall PA patterns appear significantly modified mostly in women who, in presence of the disease, present increased sedentary behavior, reduced MVPA, number of daily steps and VM counts.

Taking advantage of these capabilities to improve disease characterisation and monitoring and to support treatment decisions in MS seems obvious but faces a number of challenges: Selection and validation of a comprehensive and meaningful set of tests, managing the immense amount of data and identifying the useful information, data privacy and ascertainment of long-term adherence. Objectives: To assess systematically the feasibility of a comprehensive smartphone and smartwatch based set of digital biomarkers for disease monitoring in patients with MS (PwMS) and validate this tool against currently available state of the art clinical, imaging and body fluid assessments. Methods: The dreams App is a software application including multiple biomarkers for each of the domains movement, dexterity, cognition and vision as well as questionnaires for fatigue and other patient reported outcomes. Compliance is enhanced through a gamification- approach. We are currently conducting a feasibility study with a group of PwMS and matched healthy controls to further evaluate the technical reliability of a larger set of digital biomarkers and select those best suited for the validation studies. Early next year, the first of two independent validation studies including 400 PwMS, recruited from participants in the Swiss MS cohort (SMSC) is planned to further validate the digital biomarkers through correlation with established standardized clinical, imaging and body fluid markers already implemented in the SMSC. Results: Preliminary in-house reliability testing with healthy controls showed intra class correlation coefficients of >60% for the digital biomarkers included in the feasibility study and >80% for at least one in every domain. These results were derived through unguided repetitions over multi-day-timeframes and not optimal laboratory conditions in order to truthfully reflect future use. Conclusions: With this program, we aim at establishing dreams as a novel smartphone-based comprehensive, modular, validated, independent and broadly accepted digital assessment tool for PwMS.

RECENT FINDINGS: The digitization of most clinical data, along with developments in communication technologies, miniaturization of sensors and computational advances are enabling aggregation and clinically meaningful analyses of real-world data from patient registries, digital patient-reported outcomes and electronic health records (EHR). These data are allowing more confident descriptions of prognoses for multiple sclerosis patients and the long-term relative benefits and safety of disease-modifying treatments (DMT). Registries allow detailed, multiple sclerosis-specific data to be shared between clinicians more easily, provide data needed to improve the impact of DMT and, with EHR, characterize clinically relevant interactions between multiple sclerosis and other diseases. Wearable sensors provide continuous, long-term measures of performance dynamics in relevant ecological settings. In conjunction with telemedicine and online apps, they promise a major expansion of the scope for patients to manage aspects of their own care. Advances in disease understanding, decision support and self-management using these Big Data are being accelerated by machine learning and artificial intelligence.

Part of the known MS biomarkers are discovered in cerebrospinal fluid like oligoclonal lgG (OCGB), and also in blood like myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein (MOG). The conventional MS diagnostic methods often fail to detect the disease in early stages such as Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS), which considered as a concerning issue since CIS highlighted as a prognostic factor of MS development in most cases. Methods: MS diagnostic techniques include Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the brain and spinal cord, lumbar puncture (or spinal tap) that evaluate cerebrospinal fluid, evoked potential testing revealing abnormalities in the brain and spinal cord. These conventional diagnostic methods have some negative points such as extensive processing time as well as restriction in the quantity of samples that can be analyzed concurrently. Scientists have focused on developing the detection methods especially early detection which belongs to ultra-sensitive, non-invasive and needed for the Point of Care (POC) diagnosis because the situation was complicated by false positive or negative results. Results: As a result, biosensors are utilized and investigated since they could be ultra-sensitive to specific compounds, cost effective devices, body-friendly and easy to implement. In addition, it has been proved that the biosensors on physiological fluids (blood, serum, urine, saliva, milk etc.) have quick response in a non-invasive rout. In general form, a biosensor system for diagnosis and early detection process usually involves; biomarker (target molecule), bio receptor (recognition element) and compatible bio transducer. Conclusion: Studies underlined that early treatment of patients with high possibility of MS can be advantageous by postponing further abnormalities on MRI and subsequent attacks. This Review highlights variable disease diagnosis approaches such as Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR), electrochemical biosensors, Microarrays and microbeads based Microarrays, which are considered as promising methods for detection and early detection of MS.","Review","10.2174/1573411014666180829111004","WOS:000548930000005","WoS"

As most gold standards measure infrequently and require clinician presence, fluctuations in the daily progression are not accounted for. Due to the underlying conditions of homogeneity and stationarity (the main tenets of ergodicity) not being met for the majority of the statistical methods employed in the clinical setting, alternative approaches should be investigated. A solution is to use a non-linear time series analysis approach. Here, Early-Warning Signals (EWS) in the form of critical fluctuations in Keystroke Dynamics (KD), collected using participant's smartphones, are investigated as indicators for a clinical change in three groups. These are patients with MS and changes in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), patients with MS but without changes in MRI, and healthy controls (HCs). Here, we report examples of EWS and changes in KD coinciding with clinically relevant changes in outcome measures in both patients with and without differences in the amount of MRI enhancing lesions. We also report no clinically relevant changes in EWS in the HC population. This study is a first promising step toward using EWS to identify periods of instability as measured by a continuous objective measure as a proxy for outcome measures in the field of MS.","Article","10.1063/5.0022031","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=10897682&id=doi:10.1063%2F5.0022031&atitle=Early-warning+signals+for+disease+activity+in+patients+diagnosed+with+multiple+sclerosis+based+on+keystroke+dynamics&stitle=Chaos&title=Chaos+%28Woodbury%2C+N.Y.%29&volume=30&issue=11&spage=113133&epage=&aulast=Twose&aufirst=J.&auinit=J.&aufull=Twose+J.&coden=&isbn=&pages=113133-&date=2020&auinit1=J&auinitm=","Embase"

Relative to other long term conditions, multiple sclerosis (MS) is underserved with many apps failing to meet the needs of people with MS (pwMS) or involving end-users in their development. A Nuffield Trust report (2018) undertaken for the UK MS Society notes that: Digital transformation and the possibilities it provides have not yet been realised within the care and support that people with MS access. A consultation we undertook with pwMS and health care professionals exploring views about digital delivery models for fatigue management highlighted a lack of available tools to support the homework tasks of FACETS, a face-to-face fatigue management programme developed by members of our team. Here we report on the process of developing and user testing a digital toolkit for Android comprising the FACETS homework tasks (including an activity diary, goal planner and thought diary). In addition to being a standalone tool, the toolkit will potentially enhance engagement with the FACETS programme and the UK MS Society's online fatigue management course. The principles underpinning this work are 'Lifeworld' understanding and Socio-technical system design. People with MS are involved throughout the iterative development cycle to ensure a considered, engaging and user-centred solution. Our mixed methods development and usability work comprises three phases 1. Elicitation of user requirements 2. Supervised usability testing 3. Unsupervised usability testing To date, our findings suggest that engagement with the toolkit could be optimised via provision of support and reminders, design features that consider fatigue, cognitive and functional issues, a customisable dashboard and interactivity. Future plans include integration of SMART capability, wearable technologies and piloting it in practice. The toolkit offers possibilities for longitudinal symptom monitoring and data sharing, greater integration of self-management strategies into daily life with applicability to other long term conditions.

Current monitoring practices predominantly rely on brief and infrequent assessments, which may not be representative of the real-world patient experience. Smartphone technology provides an opportunity to assess people's daily-lived experience of MS on a frequent, regular basis outside of episodic clinical evaluations. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to evaluate the feasibility and utility of capturing real-world MS-related health data remotely using a smartphone app, """"elevateMS,"""" to investigate the associations between self-reported MS severity and sensor-based active functional tests measurements, and the impact of local weather conditions on disease burden. METHODS: This was a 12-week, observational, digital health study involving 3 cohorts: self-referred participants who reported an MS diagnosis, clinic-referred participants with neurologist-confirmed MS, and participants without MS (controls). Participants downloaded the elevateMS app and completed baseline assessments, including self-reported physical ability (Patient-Determined Disease Steps [PDDS]), as well as longitudinal assessments of quality of life (Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders [Neuro-QoL] Cognitive, Upper Extremity, and Lower Extremity Function) and daily health (MS symptoms, triggers, health, mobility, pain). Participants also completed functional tests (finger-tapping, walk and balance, voice-based Digit Symbol Substitution Test [DSST], and finger-to-nose) as an independent assessment of MS-related cognition and motor activity. Local weather data were collected each time participants completed an active task. Associations between self-reported baseline/longitudinal assessments, functional tests, and weather were evaluated using linear (for cross-sectional data) and mixed-effects (for longitudinal data) regression models. RESULTS: A total of 660 individuals enrolled in the study; 31 withdrew, 495 had MS (n=359 self-referred, n=136 clinic-referred), and 134 were controls. Participation was highest in clinic-referred versus self-referred participants (median retention: 25.5 vs 7.0 days). The top 5 most common MS symptoms, reported at least once by participants with MS, were fatigue (310/495, 62.6%), weakness (222/495, 44.8%), memory/attention issues (209/495, 42.2%), and difficulty walking (205/495, 41.4%), and the most common triggers were high ambient temperature (259/495, 52.3%), stress (250/495, 50.5%), and late bedtime (221/495, 44.6%). Baseline PDDS was significantly associated with functional test performance in participants with MS (mixed model-based estimate of most significant feature across functional tests [β]: finger-tapping: β=-43.64, P<.001; DSST: β=-5.47, P=.005; walk and balance: β=-.39, P=.001; finger-to-nose: β=.01, P=.01). Longitudinal Neuro-QoL scores were also significantly associated with functional tests (finger-tapping with Upper Extremity Function: β=.40, P<.001; walk and balance with Lower Extremity Function: β=-99.18, P=.02; DSST with Cognitive Function: β=1.60, P=.03). Finally, local temperature was significantly associated with participants' test performance (finger-tapping: β=-.14, P<.001; DSST: β=-.06, P=.009; finger-to-nose: β=-53.88, P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The elevateMS study app captured the real-world experience of MS, characterized some MS symptoms, and assessed the impact of environmental factors on symptom severity. Our study provides further evidence that supports smartphone app use to monitor MS with both active assessments and patient-reported measures of disease burden. App-based tracking may provide unique and timely real-world data for clinicians and patients, resulting in improved disease insights and management.","Article","10.2196/22108","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=22915222&id=doi:10.2196%2F22108&atitle=Evaluating+the+Utility+of+Smartphone-Based+Sensor+Assessments+in+Persons+With+Multiple+Sclerosis+in+the+Real-World+Using+an+App+%28elevateMS%29%3A+Observational%2C+Prospective+Pilot+Digital+Health+Study&stitle=JMIR+Mhealth+Uhealth&title=JMIR+mHealth+and+uHealth&volume=8&issue=10&spage=e22108&epage=&aulast=Pratap&aufirst=Abhishek&auinit=A.&aufull=Pratap+A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=e22108-&date=2020&auinit1=A&auinitm=","Embase"

Objectives: To evaluate the feasibility of capturing longitudinal symptom experience in individuals with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) using a smartphone application (ElevateMS) and smartphone sensors. Specifically, we characterized changes in patient-reported outcomes and functional performance tests (via active tasks) using passive data collected on the elevateMS mobile application from participants with and few without MS (controls), and correlated the data with documented disease severity. Methods: This was a 12-week prospective, non-interventional mobile-health study with open enrollment between 08/2017- 6/2019. Participants included individuals with an iPhone (age>18) and a sub-cohort was recruited with self-reported or neurologistconfirmed MS diagnosis. Digitally collected endpoints included truncated Patient Determined Disease Steps (PDSS), weekly short form NeuroQOLs, active functional tasks using smartphone sensors (finger-tapping, finger-to-nose, gait/balance, cognition) and passive data collection on motor activity and symptoms-triggers related to MS. Regression analysis was performed to understand the association between PDSS, NeuroQOL domains (mobility/ cognition) and active tasks. Results: A total of 457 MS patients joined the study (80% relapsing- remitting MS), of which 136 (29.8%) had neurologistconfirmed MS. Compliance (% active user/week) over 12 weeks was >50%. Fatigue, weakness, and difficulty in walking (>40% participants) were the most frequently reported MS symptoms, while hot-climate, stress and going late to bed than usual were the most frequently reported (>50% participants) potential triggers of MS worsening. Increased disease severity (as measured by PDDS), was associated with reduced walking scores (p<0.001), longer turning times (p<0.001), and reduced finger-tapping speed (p<0.001). Finger-tapping activity was associated with NeuroQoL upper extremity domain score, cognitive task measured digitally correlated with NeuroQoL cognition domain score, and walking correlated with NeuroQOL lower extremity score. Conclusions: This study utilized modern non-invasive digital technology to passively track symptoms of MS over time.

Quantitative estimation of behavioral, locomotor, and histological changes following the use of alpha-tocopherol (AT) in the animal model of MS have not been reported. The present study was planned to evaluate whether AT can improve sensorimotor dysfunction and reduce demyelination in the cuprizone (CPZ)-induced rat model of MS. Experimental approach: Female Sprague-Dawley rats (8 weeks) were fed with cuprizone diet for 5 weeks followed by intraperitoneal injections of alpha-tocopherol (100 mg/Kg) or PBS for 2 weeks (groups E1 and E2, n = 8). Group C (n = 8) was fed with normal pellets followed by intraperitoneal doses of PBS. Open-field test and beam walking were carried out on every 10(th)day. The mean area of demyelination in the corpus callosum was quantified in Luxol(®)fast blue (LFB) stained histological sections of the forebrain. Qualitative grading for relative changes in the stains of myelinated fibers was also done. Findings/Results: During withdrawal of CPZ, AT treatment increased the average speed by 22% in group E1, compared to group E2 (P < 0.05). The mean time to walk the beam was reduced in group E1 by 2.6% compared to group E2 (P < 0.05). The rearing frequency was increased in group E1 during week 6-7 compared to that in the period of CPZ treatment. The mean area of demyelination in the corpus callosum showed a 12% reduction in group E1 compared to group E2 (P < 0.05).

This study aimed at gathering preliminary wrist-based PA adherence data in free-living and relate these to the influencing factors. Methods: Ten healthy older adults (4 females, aged 70-78 years) provided health, fatigue, activity levels, attitude towards pacing, and self-efficacy information and performed a 6 min-walk test to assess their fitness. After a baseline week they followed a two-week walking and exercise intervention. Participants saw their progress via a purposely designed mobile application. Results: Walking and exercise adherence did not increase during the intervention (p= 0.38,p= 0.65). Self-efficacy decreased (p= 0.024). The baseline physical component of the Short Form Health Survey was the most predictive variable of walking adherence. Baseline perceived risk of over-activity and resting heart rate (HRrest) were the most predictive variables of exercise adherence. When the latter two were used to cluster participants according to their exercise adherence, the fitness gap between exercise-adherent and non-adherent increased after the intervention (p= 0.004). Conclusions: Risk of over-activity and HR(rest)profiled short-term exercise adherence in older adults.

In total, 332 pwMS were recruited from a specialist patient panel agency to participate in a smartphone-enabled standing panel, conducted across the United States (USA; n=76), United Kingdom (UK; n=51), France (n=53), Germany (n=50), Italy (n=51) and Spain (n=51). We submitted a survey consisting of 70-80 questions that focussed on decision-making and information sources in family planning, and behaviour during/after pregnancy. Male patients did not respond to specific questions on pregnancy. Of 332 participants, 271/332 (82%) were female; 185/271 (56%; n=185) of these females were of child bearing age (18-45 years).

Overall, 116/332 (35%) participants stated that the disease altered (69/332, 21%) or made them decide against (47/332, 14%) having children; 22/332 (6%) indicated the disease delayed their plans for having children, 50/332 (15%) led to minimal impact and 144/332 (44%) indicated no impact on plans. Primary sources of information on family planning were: 1.Healthcare professionals (HCPs): neurologists (41%), obstetricians (16%), general practitioners and family physicians (15%), MS nurses (9%); 2.Search engines and online (4%); 3.Various (5%).

This is especially concerning in African Americans, who present with greater neurological disability than Caucasians. Objective: We conducted a feasibility trial on an intervention targeting sedentary behavior in African Americans with multiple sclerosis. Methods: We examined the feasibility of the Sit Less, Move More program, a 12-week behavioral intervention that used text messaging along with theory-driven newsletters and behavioral coaching for managing sedentary behavior. We recruited ambulatory, inactive, African Americans with multiple sclerosis, and assessed feasibility on process, resource, management, and scientific outcomes. Results: Of the 64 people initially contacted, 45 were assessed for eligibility, 31 were sent the informed consent document, and 30 returned a signed document and were included in the study. Study costs were US$7242.38. Personnel time to complete the study was 130 h. There was a small effect on both device-measured (d = −0.19) and self-reported (d = −0.39) sedentary behavior. Conclusions: The Sit Less, Move More intervention is safe and feasible for African Americans with multiple sclerosis, and yielded a small reduction in sedentary behavior. The intervention was low cost and well received. Our results suggest the Sit Less, Move More program should progress towards a Phase II trial to determine its efficacy.","Article","10.1177/2055217320932341","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=20552173&id=doi:10.1177%2F2055217320932341&atitle=Feasibility+of+%E2%80%9CSit+Less%2C+Move+More%E2%80%9D%3A+An+intervention+for+reducing+sedentary+behavior+Among+African+Americans+with+MS&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.+Exp.+Transl.+Clin.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal+-+Experimental%2C+Translational+and+Clinical&volume=6&issue=2&spage=&epage=&aulast=Baird&aufirst=Jessica+F.&auinit=J.F.&aufull=Baird+J.F.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2020&auinit1=J&auinitm=F","Embase"

Enhancing physical activity (PA) might promote neuroregeneration in multiple sclerosis (MS) and positively influence disability, thus providing an alternative to medical treatment. Previous studies indicate that evidence-based patient information (EBPI) is essential for inducing behavioral change, e.g. enhancing PA. Objective: To investigate feasibility of a smartphone app providing EBPI about the benefit of PA and a simple activity feedback to enhance PA in people with CPMS in a pilot randomized controlled trial over 3 months. Methods: Thirty-eight people with CPMS (mean age 51 years, median Expanded Disability Status Scale 4.0) were 1:1 randomized into either a control group (n = 20) or an intervention group (n = 18). The intervention group received access to a multimedia EBPI app including activity feedback, texts, figures and videos. In the control group, participants received a leaflet with unspecific information about exercising in general. The EPBI itself was designed based on a systematic review. At baseline and after 3 months, all participants underwent clinical performance tests, filled in questionnaires and received an activity monitor (Actigraph(Ò)) for 7 days. The primary endpoint was the rate of responders defined as participants with a 20% increase of physical acitivity (time of moderate or vigiorous PA—MVPA) or 20% increase of the number of steps, both assessed with the activity monitor. As secondary endpoints, we compared accelerometry, performance and questionnaires adjusted for baseline measurments between the groups (ANCOVA). Moreover, we used questionnaires to compare knowledge about exercise (activity requiring physical effort, carried out to improve or improve health and fitness) in MS, usability of the app in general and motivation towards a more active lifestyle after 3 months in both groups. Results: The groups showed significant differences in disease duration and PA according to the Godin–Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire at baseline. After 3 months, we detected no difference in the rate of responders, which was an overall 22%. However, MVPA significantly increased in both groups (p < 0.001) and the intervention group tended to have a higher motivation towards a more active lifestyle (Cohens D = 0.7, p = 0.09) as measured by the questionnaire. Reponses also showed, that participants appreciated the app but claimed a lack of interactivity as a shortcoming. Conclusion: Just providing information in a multimedia smartphone app did not enhance physical activitiy more than a simple leaflet in this small pilot trial in CPMS. However, the group of app users tended to have a higher motivation towards a more active lifestyle. Overall, the concept of a smartphone app to support an active lifestyle in MS is highly appreciated by participants.","Article","10.7717/PEERJ.9303","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=21678359&id=doi:10.7717%2Fpeerj.9303&atitle=Feasibility+of+a+smartphone+app+to+enhance+physical+activity+in+progressive+MS%3A+A+pilot+randomized+controlled+pilot+trial+over+three+months&stitle=PeerJ&title=PeerJ&volume=2020&issue=6&spage=&epage=&aulast=Nasseri&aufirst=Navina+N.&auinit=N.N.&aufull=Nasseri+N.N.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2020&auinit1=N&auinitm=N","Embase"

In this paper, we focus on the estimation of the step length using machine learning techniques that could be used in an indoor positioning system. Previous step length algorithms tried to model the length of a step based on measurements from the accelerometer and some tuneable (user-specific) parameters. Machine-learning-based step length estimation algorithms eliminate these parameters to be tuned. Instead, to adapt these algorithms to different users, it suffices to provide examples of the length of multiple steps for different persons to the machine learning algorithm, so that in the training phase the algorithm can learn to predict the step length for different users. Until now, these machine learning algorithms were trained with features that were chosen intuitively. In this paper, we consider a systematic feature selection algorithm to be able to determine the features from a large collection of features, resulting in the best performance. This resulted in a step length estimator with a mean absolute error of 3.48 cm for a known test person and 4.19 cm for an unknown test person, while current state-of-the-art machine-learning-based step length estimators resulted in a mean absolute error of 4.94 cm and 6.27 cm for respectively a known and unknown test person.","Article","10.3390/S20030778","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14248220&id=doi:10.3390%2Fs20030778&atitle=Feature+Selection+for+Machine+Learning+Based+Step+Length+Estimation+Algorithms&stitle=Sensors+%28Basel%29&title=Sensors+%28Basel%2C+Switzerland%29&volume=20&issue=3&spage=&epage=&aulast=Vandermeeren&aufirst=Stef&auinit=S.&aufull=Vandermeeren+S.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2020&auinit1=S&auinitm=","Embase"

However, there is little evidence that supports the content of these diets, and earlier research in the field has shown conflicting results. We take an exploratory machine learning approach to investigate possible correlations between MS symptoms and diet. Methods: Members of the Danish MS Society were invited to register daily food intake and symptoms for up to 100 days via a smartphone-based tool. Following data collection, diet registrations were coded into food categories (n=23), food groups (n=71), and food items (n= 310). Two methods were used for analyses: 1) least squares regression (baseline), 2) fully connected feed forward networks (same-day effects). Outcome targets were nine daily registered symptoms (0 to 10 in severity) scaled to mean 0, standard deviation 1. Pearson correlation coefficients were applied on the best performing data matrix to identify strongest correlations between input features and symptom burden. Results: Pearson correlation coefficients showed strongest positive correlations between increased symptom burden and the following food groups: Coffee, soft drinks, sugar/honey/jam, red processed meat, beer, red meat-pork. Correlations negatively correlated with symptom burden were fruit and vegetable juices, vegetable oils, fruiting vegetables, chocolate and candy bars, legumes, whole grain, and nuts. Conclusion: Results indicate that diet may affect symptom burden in MS, and that machine learning methods can be used to understand complex relationships for food intake. Food groups appearing among the strongest correlations are in line with elements of existing MS diets, but further studies are needed to investigate the combination of diet elements, as our neural network models suggest that the effect of intake on symptoms is not caused by linear correlations of single food elements to symptom burden.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458520969077","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458520969077&atitle=Food+intake+and+symptom+burden-correlations+found+in+a+machine+learning+study+among+people+with+MS&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=26&issue=2+SUPPL&spage=50&epage=&aulast=Skovgaard&aufirst=Lasse&auinit=L.&aufull=Skovgaard+L.&coden=&isbn=&pages=50-&date=2020&auinit1=L&auinitm=","Embase"

The management of motor symptoms in those with MS remains a therapeutic challenge. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a type of non-invasive brain stimulation that is emerging as a promising rehabilitative tool but requires further characterization to determine its optimal therapeutic use. In this randomized, sham-controlled proof-of-concept study, we tested the immediate effects of a single tDCS session on walking and functional mobility in those with MS. Seventeen participants with MS completed one 20-min session of aerobic exercise, randomly assigned to be paired with either active (2.5 mA, n = 9) or sham (n = 8) tDCS over the primary motor cortex (M1). The groups (active vs. sham) were matched according to gender (50% vs. 60% F), age (52.1 ± 12.85 vs. 54.2 ± 8.5 years), and level of neurological disability (median Expanded Disability Status Scale score 5.5 vs. 5). Gait speed on the 10-m walk test and the Timed Up and Go (TUG) time were measured by a wearable inertial sensor immediately before and following the 20-min session, with changes compared between conditions and time. There were no significant differences in gait speed or TUG time changes following the session in the full sample or between the active vs. sham groups. These findings suggest that a single session of anodal tDCS over M1 is not sufficient to affect walking and functional mobility in those with MS. Instead, behavioral motor response of tDCS is likely to be cumulative, and the effects of multiple tDCS sessions require further study.

However, differences in methods of determining stability such as sensor type and placements, may lead to different results and affect their interpretation when comparing to controls and other studies. Questions: Do people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) exhibit lower gait stability? Do location and type of data used to calculate stability metrics affect comparisons? Methods: 30 PwMS with no walking impairments as clinically measured and 15 healthy controls walked on a treadmill at 1.2 ms(−1) while 3D acceleration data was obtained from sacrum, shoulder and cervical markers and from an accelerometer placed at the sacrum. The local divergence exponent was calculated for the four data sources. An ANOVA with group (multiple sclerosis and control) and data source as main factors was used to determine the effect of disease, data source and their interaction on stability metrics. Results: PwMS walked with significantly less stability according to all sensors (no interaction). A significant effect of data source on stability was also found, indicating that the local divergence exponent derived from sacrum accelerometer was lower than that derived from the other 3 sensor locations. Significance: PwMS with no evident gait impairments are less stable than healthy controls when walking on a treadmill. Although different data sources can be used to determine MS-related stability deterioration, a consensus about location and data source is needed.

When the San Francisco Bay Area shelter-in-place order was announced in mid-March 2020 to flatten the curve of SARS-CoV-2 infections, the abrupt closure of gyms, fitness studios, and malls greatly limited options for safe exercise. We leveraged an ongoing study utilizing wearable technology, to understand the impact of the pandemic and the shelter-in-place policy on physical activity in people with MS (PwMS) at-risk for neurological worsening. Objectives: To test the hypothesis that the average daily step count (STEPS) in people with MS would decrease due to the COVID-19 shelter-in-place order. Methods: Average daily step count (STEPS) was measured from a large UCSF MS Center cohort of PwMS using a wrist-worn accelerometer (Fitbit Flex2) as previously detailed. STEPS before and after the shelter-in-place were available for 42 participants. Amount, type and frequency of exercise, as well as fatigue (Modified Fatigue Index; MFIS-5) and mental health (Mental Health Inventory; MHI-5) were assessed via questionnaire. The UCSF Institutional Review Board approved the study protocol. Descriptive statistics and pre-post comparisons using Wilcoxon Signed-rank were performed, and figures generated, using R studio. Results: A decrease in STEPS was observed during the week (p =0.024), and month (p=0.048) after versus before the shelter-inplace order in 42 participants with valid STEPS data during this time period. Individual data showed marked decreased in STEPS the week immediately post shelter-in-place, yet some recovered to near pre shelter-in-place levels. As a group, this rebound was not significant. No significant difference comparing 2019 and 2020 similar epoch STEPS data was observed for these participants. Conclusions: The data supported the hypothesis that physical activity would be reduced in people with MS due to the COVID- 19 activated shelter-in-place. Overall prolongation of reduced activity is troubling, particularly in a population where low activity is already pervasive due to detrimental secondary effects of inactivity. These observations were made possible by the use of remote activity monitoring and aligns with broader efforts to use wearables to track and promote physical activity, augment telehealth, and improve telerehabilitation across populations with chronic neurological disorders.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458520974938","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458520974938&atitle=How+does+coronavirus+disease+2019+%28COVID-19%29+%E2%80%9Csheltering+in+place%E2%80%9D+affect+ambulatory+activity+in+people+with+multiple+sclerosis%3F&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=26&issue=3+SUPPL&spage=50&epage=&aulast=Block&aufirst=V.&auinit=V.&aufull=Block+V.&coden=&isbn=&pages=50-&date=2020&auinit1=V&auinitm=","Embase"

Previous research performed on healthy adults, demonstrated that stroboscopic training improves anticipatory timing, visual cognition, visual attention and information encoding. The efficacy of SVT has never been examined in multiple sclerosis (MS). Aim: Examine the immediate effect of SVT on cognition, gait and balance in people with MS (PwMS). Methods: Participants attended two sessions: SVT and control training. Sessions were identical in length (45-50 min) and type of exercise drills. Exercises for both groups were based on ballcatching tasks. The difference between the two practice regimens was that the SVT session was performed wearing stroboscopic glasses (Visionup, Primary shopR, Kyoto, Japan) and the control session was performed wearing similar glasses without lenses. Those who initially participated in the SVT session, subsequently performed a control session two weeks later, and vice versa. Cognition was evaluated by a computerized software program (MindstreamsR,NeuroTrax Corp., NY). Gait and balance were evaluated via wearable accelerometers (APDM, Oregon, USA). Outcome measures were collected twice during a single session, prior to training and immediately afterward. Results: This crossover study included 26 PwMS, 16 females, mean age 47.9±9.1, and median EDSS score 4.5 (range 3.0-5.5). Information processing speed increased at the post-evaluation compared with baseline, solely in the SVT session (p=0.003). The visual spatial domain displayed a trend towards improvement, although, it was below the significant cut off level (p=0.080). No differences between pre-post measurements were noted for gait and balance following SVT and control sessions. Conclusions: SVT, a non-invasive, alternative treatment approach, enhances information processing speed immediately after training in PwMS. Our findings should encourage future RCT studies to examine the effects of a longer SVT program.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458520969077","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458520969077&atitle=Immediate+effect+of+stroboscopic+visual+training+on+cognition%2C+gait+and+balance+in+people+with+MS&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=26&issue=2+SUPPL&spage=24&epage=25&aulast=Kalron&aufirst=Alon&auinit=A.&aufull=Kalron+A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=24-25&date=2020&auinit1=A&auinitm=","Embase"

Individuals can obtain a better understanding of health conditions by using wearables, but wearables also have the potential to create new possibilities within research methodologies. Wearables represent promising tools but research on the application in MS are still ongoing. However, most research focuses on the wearables' accuracy and not on the implications derived from the participants experiences. Objective: The aim of this project was to investigate the experiences among PwMS when using wearables in a research context. Method: As part of a randomized controlled trial 40 PwMS used wearables; MS-log, Fitbit, and Floodlight Open to register daily symptoms, mood, sleep, motor- A nd cognitive function. These data were used to measure possible effects from the intervention at question. After 4 months we conducted 23 individual semistructured interviews with the participants both from the intervention group and the control group. A part of the interviews' purpose was to examine the participants experiences of using the selected wearables. Data were analyzed via thematic analysis using the NVivo software. Results: Three main themes emerged from the thematic analysis: (1) Wearables provide a better understanding of health conditions for PwMS, (2) Self-tracking wearables motivate by self-competition, and (3) Wearables' gamification is experienced as exercises rather than a test. The results suggest that wearables can be beneficial in research by motivating continuous registrations of symptoms and functions. Although offering such benefits, wearables also entail certain challenges in relation to research validity when affecting health behavior among users. Conclusion: The study results indicate that using wearables as measurement tools in research entails several benefits regarding data collection, but that it may also affect PwMS' health behavior during a study and thereby influence the research validity.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458520969077","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458520969077&atitle=Implications+of+using+wearables+as+measurement+tools+in+research+from+the+perspective+of+people+with+Multiple+Sclerosis&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=26&issue=2+SUPPL&spage=33&epage=&aulast=Westergaard&aufirst=Katrine&auinit=K.&aufull=Westergaard+K.&coden=&isbn=&pages=33-&date=2020&auinit1=K&auinitm=","Embase"

Fatigue is the most common symptom in MS with a prevalence of 80%. Previous research studied the relation between fatigue and gait impairment using stationary gait analysis systems and short gait tests (e.g. timed 25 ft walk). However, wearable inertial sensors providing gait data from longer and continuous gait bouts have not been used to assess the relation between fatigue and gait parameters in MS. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the association between fatigue and spatio-temporal gait parameters extracted from wearable foot-worn sensors and to predict the degree of fatigue. Methods: Forty-nine patients with MS (32 women; 17 men; aged 41.6 years, EDSS 1.0–6.5) were included where each participant was equipped with a small Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) on each foot. Spatio-temporal gait parameters were obtained from the 6-min walking test, and the Borg scale of perceived exertion was used to represent fatigue. Gait parameters were normalized by taking the difference of averaged gait parameters between the beginning and end of the test to eliminate inter-individual differences. Afterwards, normalized parameters were transformed to principle components that were used as input to a Random Forest regression model to formulate the relationship between gait parameters and fatigue. Results: Six principal components were used as input to our model explaining more than 90% of variance within our dataset. Random Forest regression was used to predict fatigue. The model was validated using 10-fold cross validation and the mean absolute error was 1.38 points. Principal components consisting mainly of stride time, maximum toe clearance, heel strike angle, and stride length had large contributions (67%) to the predictions made by the Random Forest. Conclusions: The level of fatigue can be predicted based on spatio-temporal gait parameters obtained from an IMU based system. The results can help therapists to monitor fatigue before and after treatment and in rehabilitation programs to evaluate their efficacy. Furthermore, this can be used in home monitoring scenarios where therapists can monitor fatigue using IMUs reducing time and effort of patients and therapists.","Article","10.1186/S12984-020-00798-9","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=17430003&id=doi:10.1186%2Fs12984-020-00798-9&atitle=Inertial+sensor-based+gait+parameters+reflect+patient-reported+fatigue+in+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=J.+NeuroEng.+Rehabil.&title=Journal+of+NeuroEngineering+and+Rehabilitation&volume=17&issue=1&spage=&epage=&aulast=Ibrahim&aufirst=Alzhraa+A.&auinit=A.A.&aufull=Ibrahim+A.A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2020&auinit1=A&auinitm=A","Embase"

Fatigue is a debilitating symptom in multiple sclerosis (MS) that may be associated with reduced physical activity and increased sedentary behavior. Objective. This study examined the associations among fatigue and device-measured physical activity and sedentary behavior in people with MS. Methods. The participants (n = 252) completed the Patient Determined Disease Steps (PDDS) and Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and wore a waist-mounted accelerometer for 7 days. Participants were divided into 2 groups based on fatigue severity as measured by the FSS scale. We compared percentage of wear time spent in sedentary, light physical activity (LPA), and moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) between the 2 groups. Results. Persons in the fatigued group (FSS score ≥ 4) spent a greater percentage of time in sedentary behavior (P =.004) and a lower percentage of time in LPA (P =.035). Persons in the fatigued group further spent a lower percentage of time in nontransformed MVPA (P <.001) and square-root-transformed MVPA (P <.001) than persons in the nonfatigued group. When controlling for PDDS scores and years of education, there were no longer significant differences between groups in sedentary behavior, LPA, or transformed MVPA values; the difference in nontransformed MVPA was still statistically significant but likely the result of nonnormally distributed data. Conclusion. The present study suggests that factors other than fatigue might be associated with physical activity and sedentary behavior in MS, and this group might benefit from focal behavioral interventions that take into account mobility status in persons with MS who have fatigue.","Article","10.1177/1545968320916159","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=15526844&id=doi:10.1177%2F1545968320916159&atitle=Is+Symptomatic+Fatigue+Associated+With+Physical+Activity+and+Sedentary+Behaviors+Among+Persons+With+Multiple+Sclerosis%3F&stitle=Neurorehabil.+Neural+Repair&title=Neurorehabilitation+and+Neural+Repair&volume=34&issue=6&spage=505&epage=511&aulast=Neal&aufirst=Whitney+N.&auinit=W.N.&aufull=Neal+W.N.&coden=JNRHF&isbn=&pages=505-511&date=2020&auinit1=W&auinitm=N","Embase"

To evaluate their efficacy, it is essential to develop novel, patient-centric outcome assessments that can quantify patient's function with high frequency in their everyday life. Objectives: To develop a digital solution that enables patients to quantitatively self-assess their function at high frequency in freeliving environment in complement to in-clinic supervised administration and derive outcome measures that are able to detect the subtle changes during MS evolution. Methods: KonectomTM smartphone application was designed and developed with patient-focused user experience insights to assess cognition, upper extremity function, ambulation/mobility and MS-related quality of life. To optimize accuracy and adherence of self-assessments, tutorials, vocal instructions and completion reward features were built into the app. KonectomTM was developed under IEC 62304 / ISO 13485 standards. KonectomTM digital outcome assessments (DOAs) will derive digital features processed from iPhone X accelerometer, gyroscope, touch, force touch, and GPS sensor information. KonectomTM formal usability study was completed in September 2019, in Chicago and in Paris (N=14 participants). KonectomTM is being evaluated in two Phase 2 studies in patients with relapsing MS (NCT04079088, N=300, 72 weeks of treatment period; undisclosed RMS Ph2 study). Results: KonectomTM DOAs include 9 active test modules (mood/ physical state 5-point Likert scale, multiple sclerosis impact scale 29-item questionnaire version 2 [MSIS-29v2], cognitive processing speed test, pinching test, drawing test, grip force test, static balance test, U-turn test and 6-min walk test) and a passive continuous monitoring of mobility behaviour. In the user experience testing, KonectomTM received a system usability scale (SUS, range 0-100, mean [SD]) score of 87.7 [8.7] which is much above the benchmark average of smartphone applications with a likelihood to recommend (LTR, range 0-10, mean [SD]) of 8.1 [2.0].

As a step towards better understanding gait during daily life in neurological populations, we compared gait measures that best discriminated people with multiple sclerosis (MS) and people with Parkinson’s Disease (PD) from their respective, age-matched, healthy control subjects (MS-Ctl, PD-Ctl) in laboratory tests versus a week of daily life monitoring. Methods: We recruited 15 people with MS (age mean ± SD: 49 ± 10 years), 16 MS-Ctl (45 ± 11 years), 16 people with idiopathic PD (71 ± 5 years), and 15 PD-Ctl (69 ± 7 years). Subjects wore 3 inertial sensors (one each foot and lower back) in the laboratory followed by 7 days during daily life. Mann–Whitney U test and area under the curve (AUC) compared differences between PD and PD-Ctl, and between MS and MS-Ctl in the laboratory and in daily life. Results: Participants wore sensors for 60–68 h in daily life. Measures that best discriminated gait characteristics in people with MS and PD from their respective control groups were different between the laboratory gait test and a week of daily life. Specifically, the toe-off angle best discriminated MS versus MS-Ctl in the laboratory (AUC [95% CI] = 0.80 [0.63–0.96]) whereas gait speed in daily life (AUC = 0.84 [0.69–1.00]). In contrast, the lumbar coronal range of motion best discriminated PD versus PD-Ctl in the laboratory (AUC = 0.78 [0.59–0.96]) whereas foot-strike angle in daily life (AUC = 0.84 [0.70–0.98]). AUCs were larger in daily life compared to the laboratory. Conclusions: Larger AUC for daily life gait measures compared to the laboratory gait measures suggest that daily life monitoring may be more sensitive to impairments from neurological disease, but each neurological disease may require different gait outcome measures.","Article","10.1186/S12984-020-00781-4","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=17430003&id=doi:10.1186%2Fs12984-020-00781-4&atitle=Laboratory+versus+daily+life+gait+characteristics+in+patients+with+multiple+sclerosis%2C+Parkinson%E2%80%99s+disease%2C+and+matched+controls&stitle=J.+NeuroEng.+Rehabil.&title=Journal+of+NeuroEngineering+and+Rehabilitation&volume=17&issue=1&spage=&epage=&aulast=Shah&aufirst=Vrutangkumar+V.&auinit=V.V.&aufull=Shah+V.V.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2020&auinit1=V&auinitm=V","Embase"

Some clinical questions (disease behavior, prognosis, validation of outcome measures, comparative effectiveness, and long-term safety of therapies) are often better addressed using real-world data reflecting larger, more representative populations. Integration of disease history, clinician-reported outcomes, performance tests, and patient-reported outcome measures during patient encounters; imaging and biospecimen analyses; and data from wearable devices increase dataset utility.

Currently clinicians rely on self-report measures or simple functional assessments, administered at discrete time points, to assess fall risk. Wearable inertial sensors are a promising technology for increasing the sensitivity of clinical assessments to accurately predict fall risk, but current accelerometer-based approaches are limited. Research question: Will metrics derived from wearable accelerometers during a 30-second chair stand test (30CST) correlate with clinical measures of disease severity, balance confidence and fatigue in PwMS, and can these metrics be used to accurately discriminate fallers from non-fallers? Methods: Thirty-eight PwMS (21 fallers) completed self-report outcome measures then performed the 30CST while triaxial acceleration data were collected from inertial sensors adhered to the thigh and chest. Accelerometer metrics were derived for the sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit transitions and relationships with clinical metrics were assessed. Finally, the metrics were used to develop a logistic regression model to classify fall status. Results: Accelerometer-derived metrics were significantly associated with multiple clinical metrics that capture disease severity, balance confidence and fatigue. Performance of a logistic regression for classifying fall status was enhanced by including accelerometer features (accuracy 74%, AUC 0.78) compared to the standard of care (accuracy 68%, AUC 0.74) or patient reported outcomes (accuracy 71%, AUC 0.75). Significance: Accelerometer derived metrics were associated with clinically relevant measures of disease severity, fatigue and balance confidence during a balance challenging task. Inertial sensors could feasibly be utilized to enhance the accuracy of functional assessments to identify fall risk in PwMS. Simplicity of these accelerometer-based metrics could facilitate deployment for community-based monitoring.","Article","10.1016/J.GAITPOST.2020.06.014","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=18792219&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.gaitpost.2020.06.014&atitle=Metrics+extracted+from+a+single+wearable+sensor+during+sit-stand+transitions+relate+to+mobility+impairment+and+fall+risk+in+people+with+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Gait+Posture&title=Gait+and+Posture&volume=80&issue=&spage=361&epage=366&aulast=Tulipani&aufirst=Lindsey+J.&auinit=L.J.&aufull=Tulipani+L.J.&coden=GAPOF&isbn=&pages=361-366&date=2020&auinit1=L&auinitm=J","Embase"

Methods: This multicentre, open-label, randomized, controlled, crossover study enrolled 141 PwMS and 76 healthy controls (HCs). All participants performed MSCopilot and MSFC tests at day 0. To assess reproducibility, 46 PwMS performed the same tests at day 30 ± 3. The primary end-point was the validation of MSCopilot versus MSFC for the identification of PwMS against HCs, quantified using the area under the curve (AUC). The main secondary end-point was the correlation of MSCopilot z-scores with MSFC z-scores. Results: In all, 116 PwMS and 69 HCs were analysed. The primary end-point was achieved: MSCopilot performance was non-inferior to that of MSFC (AUC 0.92 and 0.89 respectively; P = 0.3). MSCopilot and MSFC discriminated PwMS and HCs with 81% and 76% sensitivity and 82% and 88% specificity respectively. Digital and standard test scores were highly correlated (r = 0.81; P < 0.001).

Utilising global positioning systems (GPS), WI-FI positioning and an in-built smartphone accelerometer to measure distance walked by a PwMS outdoors or indoors, could alleviate the uncertainty around using pedometers in those with gait disturbances, and is an attractive option. Objectives: To pilot an accurate measure of distance walked using a smartphone application (mSteps) to facilitate Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) measurement, indoors and outdoors, using both an MS and a control cohort. Methods: The pilot study recruited 25 PwMS and 10 controls. mSteps utilised the iPhone's inbuilt accelerometer and GPS functionalities to calculate the distance walked and time taken, indoors and outdoors. Due to unpredictable weather the physician monitored walk took place indoors which was fitted with location beacons to allow for WI-FI indoor positioning. The control cohort did the same walk indoors and outdoors to validate the use of the GPS functionality. The participant was instructed to walk 25 feet, without rest, whilst the study phone was attached to their arm using a runner's arm band and study personnel walked alongside them with a trundle wheel. Measurements were taken at 3 separate time points within a 3-month period. 95% levels of agreement between app and trundle wheel (gold standard) were calculated using the Bland-Altman repeated measures analysis. Levels of agreement, app vs trundle, were calculated for indoor measurements on both PwMS and controls with additional app vs trundle outdoor measurements for controls only. The a priori defined clinically acceptable difference was 1.52m. Results: The 95% levels of agreement for indoor measurements on PwMS were -2.46 to 2.27m; and for controls were -2.02 to 2.71m. The 95% levels of agreement for outdoor measurements on controls were -0.45 to 0.43m. Conclusions: The outdoor GPS functionality of mSteps is very accurate as shown by the 95% levels of agreements compared to the a priori clinically determined difference. The indoor WI-FI positioning function of mSteps however, was not accurate enough and shows that it is not reliable enough for further use. The control cohort showed the same inaccuracy indoors which eliminates the possibility that an uneven gait pattern in the MS cohort contributed to the error margin. A further validity study is being carried out, looking at a cohort of PwMS walking outdoors using mSteps and a trundle wheel.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458520974937","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458520974937&atitle=Msteps%3A+A+pilot+study+using+a+phone+application+with+gps%2C+accelerometers+and+wi-fi+positioning+to+measure+walking+distance+in+ms%2C+indoors+and+outdoors&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=26&issue=3+SUPPL&spage=173&epage=174&aulast=Alexander&aufirst=S.&auinit=S.&aufull=Alexander+S.&coden=&isbn=&pages=173-174&date=2020&auinit1=S&auinitm=","Embase"

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is useful in the diagnosis of MS, surpassing all other imaging techniques in terms of prediction accuracy. Depending on the number and location of lesions, however, the success of MR can vary significantly in terms of sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of MS. Adverse effects of various intensity and residual artifacts in the MRI data make it challenging to compute MS lesion volume to assess the progression of MS. Therefore, the development of robust and automated MS lesion detection methods has been a challenge. Objectives: This study aims to develop a novel, robust, and simple image segmentation method to perform quantitative analysis of MS lesions from multimodal MRI data. Methods: An algorithm based on a supervised minimum Euclidean distance-based clustering method employing three 2D MRI modalities, T1-weighted (T1w), fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and T2-weighted (T2w) MRI was developed for classification of significant brain tissues and MS lesions. The developed method was applied to an MRI dataset from six MS patients. Results: The developed method classifies various brain tissues and detects MS lesions with over 90% accuracy and specificity, and 62%–65% sensitivity, on average. Conclusions: Segmentation of different brain tissues using our proposed algorithm results in superior MS lesion-detection accuracy, comparable with the recent deep-learning classification results in the literature.","Article","10.1016/J.IMU.2020.100409","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=23529148&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.imu.2020.100409&atitle=Multiple+sclerosis+lesion+detection+in+multimodal+MRI+using+simple+clustering-based+segmentation+and+classification&stitle=Inform.+Med.+Unlocked&title=Informatics+in+Medicine+Unlocked&volume=20&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Cetin&aufirst=Ozdemir&auinit=O.&aufull=Cetin+O.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2020&auinit1=O&auinitm=","Embase"

Emerging technologies, such as wearable activity monitors (i.e. Accelerometers) and mobile applications (apps), provide innovative methods of objectively measuring MS patient outcomes. However, there is a gap in scientific knowledge about MS patients' experiences with using these technologies in clinical research. This knowledge is imperative because patients' perceptions of these technologies can affect adherence to study protocols. Research is needed to understand the feasibility of using these technologies for continuous long-term monitoring and data collection. Objectives: To describe how persons living with MS perceived an accelerometer and diet-tracking app in a longitudinal clinical study and to apply this knowledge to the design and conduct of future clinical research. Methods: This was a qualitative study nested in a larger observational study, which collected data using the Actigraph accelerometer and Calorie-Mama AI mobile app. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted during final study visits (September 2018- March 2019), audio recorded, and transcribed verbatim. We continued interviewing participants until data saturation occurred. Qualitative data were analyzed using the constant comparative method. To further explore qualitative results, we did chi-squared tests to examine relationships between 1. age and successful diet tracking and 2. disability and interest in an MS self-management app. Results: We interviewed 28 persons living with MS: 68% were female, mean age was 45.5 years, and median Expanded Disability Status Score (EDSS) was 2 (indicating low disability). Participants' perceptions of the accelerometer were that it was bulky (n=21) and attracted unwanted attention (n=9), and that the band was uncomfortable (n=20). Participants (n=12) also mentioned they would have liked feedback from the device during or after the study. Despite stated issues, 93% of participants indicated they would use the device again in future studies. The mobile app was perceived as difficult to use to accurately track food (n=21) and time-consuming (n=10). As a result, half of participants did not correctly record their diet for the study. Younger age was associated with successful app use [X2 (1, N=27)= 4.46, p=0.035]. Also, many persons living with MS were interested in an MS self-management app, and interest was associated with higher EDSS [X2 (1, N=27)= 6.01, p=0.022]. Conclusions: Although participants had negative perceptions of the accelerometer, they were willing to use it for future studies, suggesting only minor design modifications may be needed. Mobile apps also should be easy to navigate and use, especially among older persons living with MS. A surprising finding was that MS mobile apps may be more appealing to younger persons living with MS who have greater disability.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458520974937","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458520974937&atitle=Multiple+sclerosis+patients%27+perceptions+of+using+an+accelerometer+and+mobile+app+for+clinical+research&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=26&issue=3+SUPPL&spage=540&epage=541&aulast=Kossoff&aufirst=M.&auinit=M.&aufull=Kossoff+M.&coden=&isbn=&pages=540-541&date=2020&auinit1=M&auinitm=","Embase"

This fatigue may play a role in lack of balance control in PwMS. Poor balance control poses a serious health concern for PwMS, resulting in falls, limiting independence, and reducing quality of life. Objectives: To test the effects of motor fatigue on static postural balance control and ambulatory gait in PwMS compared to healthy controls. Methods: Eighteen PwMS and fifteen age-matched healthy control participants underwent a fatiguing protocol consisting of a sustained maximum voluntary contraction of plantarflexor (PF) muscles for one minute. PF muscles were chosen for the fatigue assessment as these muscles significantly contribute to the use of the ankle strategy to control standing posture. Standing balance data were collected immediately before and after implementing the fatiguing protocol using wearable sensors placed on the wrists, sternum, lumbar spine, and dorsal aspect of the feet. Standing balance was measured for thirty seconds while standing with eyesopen on a firm surface and a foam surface. Results: Increases in trunk sway during static postural sway tests were found in PwMS after the fatiguing task but not in healthy control subjects. Specifically, PwMS showed the greatest changes in trunk range of motion, velocity, jerk and the root mean square of the sway angle in the coronal plane after the fatiguing protocol (p<0.05), while healthy controls did not show any change. Conclusions: The increase in trunk sway during quiet stance in PwMS after fatigue of ankle PF muscles are consistent with impaired control of postural sway. This increase in trunk sway also indicates decreased use of the ankle strategy and increased use of the hip strategy to control stance posture, secondary to impaired posture sway control. This type of “truncal ataxia” in PwMS may reflect a shift to use of hip torque, rather than fatigued ankle torque, to control standing balance. Ensuing studies will investigate the effects of PF muscle fatigue on balance control during gait and investigate neural correlates of fatigue in MS.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458520917096","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458520917096&atitle=Muscle+fatigue+in+people+with+multiple+sclerosis+impairs+standing+balance&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=26&issue=1+SUPPL&spage=25&epage=&aulast=Prewitt&aufirst=A.L.&auinit=A.L.&aufull=Prewitt+A.L.&coden=&isbn=&pages=25-&date=2020&auinit1=A&auinitm=L","Embase"

Methods: Consecutive patients meeting the 2010 MS diagnostic criteria and healthy controls were offered enrollment. Participants completed finger and foot taps wearing the MYO-band© (accelerometer, gyroscope, and surface electromyogram sensors). Signal processing was performed to extract spatiotemporal features from raw sensor data. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) assessed intertest reproducibility. Spearman correlation and multivariable regression methods compared extracted features to physician- and patient-reported disability outcomes. Partial least squares regression identified the most informative extracted textural features. Results: Baseline data for 117 participants with MS (EDSS 1.0–7.0) and 30 healthy controls were analyzed. ICCs for final selected features ranged from 0.80 to 0.87. Time-based features distinguished cases from controls (P = 0.002). The most informative combination of extracted features from all three sensors strongly correlated with physician EDSS (finger taps r(s) = 0.77, P < 0.0001; foot taps r(s) = 0.82, P < 0.0001) and had equally strong associations with patient-reported outcomes (WHODAS, finger taps r(s) = 0.82, P < 0.0001; foot taps r(s) = 0.82, P < 0.0001). Associations remained with multivariable modeling adjusted for age and sex. Conclusions: Extracted features from the multi-sensor demonstrate striking correlations with gold standard outcomes. Ideal for future generalizability, the assessments take only a few minutes, can be performed by nonclinical personnel, and wearing the band is nondisruptive to routine practice. This novel paradigm holds promise as a new neurological vital sign.","Article","10.1002/ACN3.50988","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=23289503&id=doi:10.1002%2Facn3.50988&atitle=Novel+MS+vital+sign%3A+multi-sensor+captures+upper+and+lower+limb+dysfunction&stitle=Ann.+Clin.+Transl.+Neurol.&title=Annals+of+Clinical+and+Translational+Neurology&volume=7&issue=3&spage=288&epage=295&aulast=Akhbardeh&aufirst=Alireza&auinit=A.&aufull=Akhbardeh+A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=288-295&date=2020&auinit1=A&auinitm=","Embase"

Objectives: We investigated whether sensor-based gait analysis is able to detect gait impairments in patients with MS (PwMS). Methods: A foot-worn sensor-based gait analysis system was used in 102 PwMS and 22 healthy controls (HC) that were asked to perform the 25-foot walking test (25FWT) two times in a self-selected speed (25FWT_pref), followed by two times in a speed as fast as possible (25FWT_fast). The Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS-12) was used as a subjective measure of patient mobility. Patients were divided into EDSS and functional system subgroups. Results: Datasets between two consecutive measurements (test-retest-reliability) were highly correlated in all analysed mean gait parameters (e.g. 25FWT_fast: stride length r = 0.955, gait speed r = 0.969) Subgroup analysis between HC and PwMS with lower (EDSS≤3.5) and higher (EDSS 4.0–7.0) disability showed significant differences in mean stride length, gait speed, toe off angle, stance time and swing time (e.g. stride length of EDSS subgroups 25FWT_fast p ≤ 0.001, 25FWT_pref p = 0.003). The differences between EDSS subgroups were more pronounced in fast than in self-selected gait speed (e.g. stride length 25FWT_fast 33.6 cm vs. 25FWT_pref 16.3 cm). Stride length (25FWT_fast) highly correlated to EDSS (r=-0.583) and MSWS-12 (r=-0.668). We observed significant differences between HC and PwMS with (FS 0–1) and without (FS≥2) pyramidal or cerebellar disability (e.g. gait speed of FS subgroups p ≤ 0.001). Conclusion: Sensor-based gait analysis objectively supports the clinical assessment of gait abnormalities even in the lower stages of MS, especially when walking with fast speed. Stride length and gait speed where identified as the most clinically relevant gait measures. Thus, it may be used to support the assessment of PwMS with gait impairment in the future, e.g. for more objective classification of disability. Its role in home-monitoring scenarios need to be evaluated in further studies.","Article","10.1016/J.MSARD.2019.101903","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=22110356&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.msard.2019.101903&atitle=Objective+sensor-based+gait+measures+reflect+motor+impairment+in+multiple+sclerosis+patients%3A+Reliability+and+clinical+validation+of+a+wearable+sensor+device&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+Relat.+Disord.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+and+Related+Disorders&volume=39&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Felix&aufirst=Flachenecker&auinit=F.&aufull=Felix+F.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2020&auinit1=F&auinitm=","Embase"

These electronic devices are millimetric in size and in the future could be mass-produced at low cost.

So far, only the SiMoT detection of proteins, using the corresponding antibodies as recognition elements, has been reported. In this study, the SiMoT sensing response toward genomic biomarkers is proposed. Herein, the gate is functionalized with a genomic biomarker for multiple sclerosis (miR-182).

In order to establish the benefits of this approach, we need to operationalize what is expected in terms of a successful measurement. We focused on three clinical long-term conditions where a novel case has been made for the benefits of RMT: major depressive disorder (MDD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and epilepsy. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to conduct a consultation exercise on the clinical end point or outcome measurement priorities for RMT studies, drawing on the experiences of people with chronic health conditions. METHODS: A total of 24 participants (16/24 women, 67%), ranging from 28 to 65 years of age, with a diagnosis of one of three chronic health conditions-MDD, MS, or epilepsy-took part in six focus groups. A systematic thematic analysis was used to extract themes and subthemes of clinical end point or measurement priorities. RESULTS: The views of people with MDD, epilepsy, and MS differed. Each group highlighted unique measurements of importance, relevant to their specific needs. Although there was agreement that remote measurement could be useful for tracking symptoms of illness, some symptoms were specific to the individual groups. Measuring signs of wellness was discussed more by people with MDD than by people with MS and epilepsy. However, overlap did emerge when considering contextual factors, such as life events and availability of support (MDD and epilepsy) as well as ways of coping (epilepsy and MS). CONCLUSIONS: This is a unique study that puts patients' views at the forefront of the design of a clinical study employing novel digital resources. In all cases, measuring symptom severity is key; people want to know when their health is getting worse. Second, symptom severity needs to be placed into context. A holistic approach that, in some cases, considers signs of wellness as well as illness, should be the aim of studies employing RMT to understand the health of people with chronic conditions.","Article","10.2196/15086","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=22915222&id=doi:10.2196%2F15086&atitle=Patients%27+Measurement+Priorities+for+Remote+Measurement+Technologies+to+Aid+Chronic+Health+Conditions%3A+Qualitative+Analysis&stitle=JMIR+Mhealth+Uhealth&title=JMIR+mHealth+and+uHealth&volume=8&issue=6&spage=e15086&epage=&aulast=Simblett&aufirst=Sara&auinit=S.&aufull=Simblett+S.&coden=&isbn=&pages=e15086-&date=2020&auinit1=S&auinitm=","Embase"

Inertial measurement units (IMUs) provide reliable and yet easy quantitative gait assessment in routine clinical settings. However, to the best of our knowledge, no automated step-detection algorithm performs well in detecting severely altered pMS gait. Method: This article elaborates on a step-detection method based on personalized templates tested against a gold standard. Twenty-two individuals with pMS and 10 young healthy subjects (HSs) were instructed to walk on an electronic walkway wearing synchronized IMUs. Templates were derived from the IMU signals by using Initial and Final Contact times given by the walkway. These were used to detect steps from other gait trials of the same individual (intra-individual template-based detection, IITD) or another participant from the same group (pMS or HS) (intra-group template-based detection, IGTD). All participants were seen twice with a 6-month interval, with two measurements performed at each visit. Performance and accuracy metrics were computed, along with a similarity index (SId), which was computed as the mean distance between detected steps and their respective closest template. Results: For HS participants, both the IITD and the IGTD algorithms had precision and recall of 1.00 for detecting steps. For pMS participants, precision and recall ranged from 0.94 to 1.00 for IITD and 0.85 to 0.95 for IGTD depending on the level of disability. The SId was correlated with performance and the accuracy of the result. An SId threshold of 0.957 (IITD) and 0.963 (IGTD) could rule out decreased performance (F-measure ≤ 0.95), with negative predictive values of 0.99 and 0.96 with the IITD and IGTD algorithms. Also, the SId computed with the IITD and IGTD algorithms could distinguish individuals showing changes at 6-month follow-up. Conclusion: This personalized step-detection method has high performance for detecting steps in pMS individuals with severely altered gait. The algorithm can be self-evaluating with the SI, which gives a measure of the confidence the clinician can have in the detection. What is more, the SId can be used as a biomarker of change in disease severity occurring between the two measurement times.","Article","10.3389/FNEUR.2020.00261","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=16642295&id=doi:10.3389%2Ffneur.2020.00261&atitle=Personalized+Template-Based+Step+Detection+From+Inertial+Measurement+Units+Signals+in+Multiple+Sclerosis&stitle=Front.+Neurol.&title=Frontiers+in+Neurology&volume=11&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Vienne-Jumeau&aufirst=Ali%C3%A9nor&auinit=A.&aufull=Vienne-Jumeau+A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2020&auinit1=A&auinitm=","Embase"

MS results in declines in physical activity and peak oxygen consumption that might be independently associated with declines in walking performance. Therefore our purpose was to evaluate the association between physical activity and peak oxygen consumption with walking performance in individuals with MS. Methods: Fifty individuals with MS between the ages of 18–70 yrs. (Female: 38; 46 ± 12 yrs.; BMI: 28.5 ± 6.4; EDSS: 3.3 [IQR: 2.5–4]) performed a maximal incremental cycle test to assess peak oxygen consumption (VO(2peak)), and wore an accelerometer for one week to measure moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Subjects further completed a timed 25-foot walk test (T25FW) and 6-minute walk (6MW) to measure walking performance. Results: MVPA and VO(2)peak were correlated with 6MW and T25FW (p < 0.05). When combined in multivariate regression analyses, VO(2peak) and MVPA were both significant contributors of T25FW speed and 6MW, but after controlling for sex and age, MVPA was the only significant contributor (β = 0.32 and β = 0.44, respectively). Conclusion: Both higher MVPA and VO(2peak) were associated with better walking performance and in a combined model physical activity, but not peak oxygen consumption, remained an independent contributor to walking performance in individuals with MS. These results suggest that improving MVPA is a potential target for interventions to improve walking performance in persons with MS.","Article","10.1016/J.MSARD.2020.101941","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=22110356&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.msard.2020.101941&atitle=Physical+activity+and+peak+oxygen+consumption+are+associated+with+walking+in+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+Relat.+Disord.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+and+Related+Disorders&volume=40&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Hibner&aufirst=Brooks+A.&auinit=B.A.&aufull=Hibner+B.A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2020&auinit1=B&auinitm=A","Embase"

Objective: To validate RAM in progressive MS using (1) traditional psychometric methods (2) brain atrophy. Methods: 56 people with progressive MS participated in a longitudinal study over 2.5 years. An arm-worn RAM device measured activity over six days, every six months, and incorporated triaxial accelerometry and transcutaneous physiological variable measurement. Five RAM variables were assessed: physical activity duration, step count, active energy expenditure, metabolic equivalents and a composite RAM score incorporating all four variables. Other assessments every six months included EDSS, MSFC, MSIS-29, Chalder Fatigue Scale and Beck’s Depression Inventory. Annualized brain atrophy was measured using SIENA. Results: RAM was tolerated well by people with MS; the device was worn 99.4% of the time. RAM had good convergent and divergent validity and was responsive, especially with respect to step count. Measurement of physical activity over one day was as responsive as six days. The composite RAM score positively correlated with brain volume loss.

To successfully perform rapid repetitive movements such as tapping, a person must be able to consistently turn on and off motor units to switch between the up and down movement phases. However, it is not clear which specific movement phase that occurs during tapping is different between MS subtypes. The objective of this study was to quantify and characterize performance differences during rapid hand- and foot-tapping tests between relapsing-remitting (RRMS) and progressive (PMS) forms of MS, as well as how both subtypes differ from non-MS controls. Methods: Participants in this study included 30 non-MS controls, 32 RRMS, and 31 PMS. Participants wore inertial sensors on all hands and feet and were instructed to tap as fast as possible for 10 s. Angular velocity from the gyroscope was used to quantify inter-tap interval (ms), coefficient of variation of inter-tap interval (COV), and up- and down-movement characteristics (duration (ms), COV, peak angular velocity (rad/s)). Differences between groups were examined with ANOVA and independent t-tests. Inter-tap interval was examined for its ability to distinguish between RRMS and PMS by a binary logistic regression analysis. Up-down movement characteristics were further evaluated for within-group directional differences (up- vs. down-phase movement components) with paired-sample t-tests. Results: Inter-tap interval for both hand- and foot-tapping differed between controls and MS, but only foot tapping was different between RRMS and PMS (RRMS = 286.7 ± 83.0 ms; PMS = 379.5 ± 170.9 ms; mean difference (d) = -92.8 ms). Logistic regression analysis showed foot-tap interval but not hand-tap interval has the potential to distinguish between RRMS and PMS (Area under the ROC = 0.71). Both up- and down-movement duration differences were consistent with the results for inter-tap interval, but up-movement duration showed larger mean group differences than down-movement differences. No significant group differences in overall inter-tap interval COV were detected for either hand- or foot-tapping; however, up-movement foot-tapping variation (CON = 18.7 ± 6.1; RRMS = 25.5 ± 11.2; PMS = 23.3 ± 8.6; CON vs RRMS d = -6.8; CON vs PMS d = -4.7), but not down-movement variation was different between controls and MS. Up- and down-peak angular velocity during foot-tapping were different between controls and PMS (CON Up = 1.4 ± 0.5 rad/s; PMS Up = 1.0 ± 0.4 rad/s; Up d = 0.4 rad/s; CON Down= 1.5 ± 0.6 rad/s; PMS Down = 1.2 ± 0.5 rad/s; Down d = 0.3 rad/s), and up-movement peak angular velocity differences showed larger mean group differences than the down-movement peak angular velocity between controls and PMS. Conclusion: Foot-tapping differs between MS disease subtypes and has greater potential than hand-tapping to distinguish between subtypes. Performance in the up-movement showed larger group differences than the down-movement, suggesting that the anti-gravity up-movement during tapping may be more important diagnostically. Future studies should be conducted on the nature of the physiological mechanisms underlying impairments in anti-gravity movements in people with MS.","Article","10.1016/J.MSARD.2020.102031","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=22110356&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.msard.2020.102031&atitle=Rapid+foot-tapping+but+not+hand-tapping+ability+is+different+between+relapsing-remitting+and+progressive+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+Relat.+Disord.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+and+Related+Disorders&volume=41&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Sato&aufirst=Sumire&auinit=S.&aufull=Sato+S.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2020&auinit1=S&auinitm=","Embase"

METHODS: In total, 102 MS patients and 24 controls were included in this observational study. Keyboard interactions were obtained with the Neurokeys keyboard app. Eight timing-related keystroke features were assessed for reliability with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs); construct validity by analysing group differences (in fatigue, gadolinium-enhancing lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and patients vs controls); and concurrent validity by correlating with disability measures. RESULTS: Reliability was moderate in two (ICC = 0.601 and 0.742) and good to excellent in the remaining six features (ICC = 0.760-0.965). Patients had significantly higher keystroke latencies than controls.

Contrary to clinical measures, smartphone-based assessment allows more frequent measurements in the everyday environment, which potentially better reflects daily functioning. Objectives: To determine the reliability, concurrent and ecological validity of self-administered smartphone-adapted Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) and Two-Minute Walking Test (2MWT). Methods: Patients with MS were recruited. At baseline the SDMT and Timed 25-foot Walk Test (T25FW) were assessed clinically. During a 28-day follow-up, patients used the MS sherpa® app to perform the smartphone SDMT and 2MWT three times a week. The smartphone SDMT was assessed through tapping numbers corresponding to symbols on the smartphone during 90 seconds. The 2MWT measured walking distance utilizing the smartphone built-in sensors during two minutes of normal walking. Reliability of the smartphone tests were assessed by calculating intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) between scores from week 2 and 3. Concurrent validity was addressed by calculation of correlation coefficients between the smartphone tests and their clinical counterparts. MS sherpa® also included one-item self-report scores for perceived fatigue and impact of MS on daily functioning. To assess ecological validity, the temporal association between the MS sherpa® tests and self-report scores from the everyday environment were analyzed using linear mixed models with the repeated measures as random effects. Results: 102 patients with MS were included. During the 28-day follow-up 102 patients completed a mean (± SD) of 12.1 (± 6.8) SDMTs and 74 patients completed a mean (± SD) of 8.8 (± 6.1) 2MWTs. Smartphone SDMT correlated significantly with the clinical SDMT (r = 0.607, p < 0.001) and demonstrated excellent reliability (ICC = 0.923). 2MWT was significantly correlated with T25FW (ρ = -0.352, p = 0.001) and demonstrated good reliability (ICC = 0.845). Over the 28-day period, higher 2MWT scores were related with lower perceived impact of MS on daily functioning (b = -0.005, 95% CI [-0.010, -0.001]) and higher SDMT scores were related with lower perceived fatigue (b = -0.014, 95% CI [-0.026, -0.003]). Conclusions: Smartphone-adapted cognition and walking tests can be assessed frequently from the participants' own environment and demonstrated validity and reliability in assessment of information processing speed and ambulatory function in MS. Support for ecological validity was found for perceived fatigue and impact on functioning in the everyday environment.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458520974937","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458520974937&atitle=Reliability%2C+concurrent+and+ecological+validity+of+smartphone-based+cognition+and+walking+tests&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=26&issue=3+SUPPL&spage=188&epage=&aulast=Lam&aufirst=K.H.&auinit=K.H.&aufull=Lam+K.H.&coden=&isbn=&pages=188-&date=2020&auinit1=K&auinitm=H","Embase"

Objectives: We examined non-ambulatory measures of upper and lower extremity sensorimotor function that may reveal differences between relapsing–remitting and progressive forms of multiple sclerosis. Methods: Cutaneous sensitivity, proprioception, central motor function and mobility were assessed in 32 relapsing–remitting and 31 progressive multiple sclerosis patients and 30 non-multiple sclerosis controls. Results: Cutaneous sensation differed between relapsing–remitting and progressive multiple sclerosis at the foot and to a lesser extent the hand. Proprioception function in the upper but not the lower extremity differed between relapsing–remitting and progressive multiple sclerosis, but was different for both upper and lower extremities between multiple sclerosis patients and non-multiple sclerosis controls. Foot-tap but not hand-tap speed was slower in progressive compared to relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis, suggestive of greater central motor function impairment in the lower extremity in progressive multiple sclerosis. In addition, the non-ambulatory sensorimotor measures were more sensitive in detecting differences between relapsing–remitting and progressive multiple sclerosis than mobility assessed with the 25-foot walk test. Conclusion: This study provides novel information about changes in sensorimotor function in progressive compared with relapsing–remitting forms of multiple sclerosis, and in particular the importance of assessing both upper and lower extremity function. Importantly, our findings showed loss of proprioceptive function in multiple sclerosis but also in progressive compared to relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis.","Article","10.1177/2055217320934835","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=20552173&id=doi:10.1177%2F2055217320934835&atitle=Sensorimotor+function+in+progressive+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.+Exp.+Transl.+Clin.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal+-+Experimental%2C+Translational+and+Clinical&volume=6&issue=2&spage=&epage=&aulast=Miehm&aufirst=Jules+D&auinit=J.D.&aufull=Miehm+J.D.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2020&auinit1=J&auinitm=D","Embase"

In this work, a novel Sensorized Tip is proposed for monitoring People with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS) that require Assistive Devices for Walking (ADW) such as canes or crutches. The developed Sensorized Tip can be adapted to the personal ADW of each patient to reduce its impact, and provides sensor data while naturally walking in the everyday activities. This data that can be processed to obtain relevant indicators that helps assessing the status of the patient. Different from other approaches, a full validation of the proposed processing algorithms is carried out in this work, and a preliminary study-case is carried out with PwMS considering a set of indicators obtained from the Sensorized Tip's processed data.

However, gait data collected in non-controlled settings are often fragmented and may not provide enough information for reliable measures. This paper evaluates a novel approach to (1) determine the effects of the length of the walking task on the reliability of calculated measures and (2) identify digital biomarkers for gait assessments from fragmented data. Thirty-seven participants (37) diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS (EDSS range 0 to 4.5) executed two trials, walking 20 m each, with inertial sensors attached to their right and left shanks. Gait events were identified from the medio-lateral angular velocity, and short bouts of gait data were extracted from each trial, with lengths varying from 3 to 9 gait cycles. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) evaluate the degree of agreement between the two trials of each participant, according to the number of gait cycles included in the analysis. Results show that short bouts of gait data, including at least six gait cycles of bilateral data, can provide reliable gait measurements for persons with MS, opening new perspectives for gait assessment using fragmented data (e.g., wearable devices, community assessments). Stride time variability and asymmetry, as well as stride velocity variability and asymmetry, should be further explored as digital biomarkers to support the monitoring of symptoms of persons with neurological diseases.","Article","10.3390/BIOS10090128","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=20796374&id=doi:10.3390%2FBIOS10090128&atitle=Short+bouts+of+gait+data+and+body-worn+inertial+sensors+can+provide+reliable+measures+of+spatiotemporal+gait+parameters+from+bilateral+gait+data+for+persons+with+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Biosensors&title=Biosensors&volume=10&issue=9&spage=&epage=&aulast=Ader&aufirst=Lilian+Genaro+Motti&auinit=L.G.M.&aufull=Ader+L.G.M.&coden=BISSE&isbn=&pages=-&date=2020&auinit1=L&auinitm=G.M.","Embase"

These technologies have the potential to allow the early diagnosis of disease, and trigger treatments at the time when they have the greatest opportunity to be effective. We will describe a technology that we have developed for high sensitivity protein detection, namely, single molecule arrays (Simoa). Simoa is based on the capture of protein molecules on magnetic beads, labeling each protein with an enzyme, and counting of single enzyme labels on beads that are isolated in arrays of femtoliter wells. Simoa has enabled the detection of proteins at subfemtomolar concentrations in a variety of biological fluids. We describe the impact of higher sensitivity of proteins using Simoa on: less invasive testing; earlier detection of disease; providing biomarker baseline profiles for healthy individuals; testing of small sample volumes; monitoring of therapeutic efficacy; faster tests; and detection of proteins in complex samples. We also provide a perspective of how new technologies that allow the low-cost manufacture and miniaturization of Simoa could drive the next wave of analytical devices, including wearables.","Conference Paper","10.1109/JBHI.2020.2971553","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=21682208&id=doi:10.1109%2FJBHI.2020.2971553&atitle=Short+Keynote+Paper%3A+Single+Molecule+Detection+of+Protein+Biomarkers+to+Define+the+Continuum+from+Health+to+Disease&stitle=IEEE+J.+Biomedical+Health+Informat.&title=IEEE+Journal+of+Biomedical+and+Health+Informatics&volume=24&issue=7&spage=1864&epage=1868&aulast=Duffy&aufirst=David+C.&auinit=D.C.&aufull=Duffy+D.C.&coden=ITIBF&isbn=&pages=1864-1868&date=2020&auinit1=D&auinitm=C","Embase"

Commercial research-based accelerometers are considered to be more valuable as they measure real-life mobility. Smartphone accelerometry might be an easily accessible alternative. Objective: To explore smartphone accelerometry in comparison to clinical tests, surveys, and a wrist-worn ActiGraph in pwMS and controls. Methods: Sixty-seven pwMS and 70 matched controls underwent mobility tests and surveys. Real-life data were collected with a smartphone and an ActiGraph over 7 days. We explored different smartphone metrics in a technical validation course and computed afterward correlation between ActiGraph (steps per minute), smartphone accelerometry (variance of vector magnitude), clinical tests, and surveys. We also determined the ability to separate between patients and controls as well as between different disability groups. Results: Based on the technical validation, we found the variance of the vector magnitude as a reliable estimate to discriminate wear time and no wear-time of the smartphone. Due to a further association with different activity levels, it was selected for real-life analyses. In the cross-sectional study, ActiGraph correlated moderately (r = 0.43, p < 0.05) with the smartphone but less with clinical tests (rho between |0.211| and |0.337|). Smartphone data showed stronger correlations with age (rho = −0.487) and clinical tests (rho between |0.565| and |0.605|). ActiGraph only differed between pwMS and controls (p < 0.001) but not between disability groups. At the same time, the smartphone showed differences between pwMS and controls, between RRMS and PP-/SPMS, and between participants with/without ambulatory impairment (all p < 0.001). Conclusions: Smartphone accelerometry provides better estimates of mobility and disability than a wrist-worn standard accelerometer in a free-living context for both controls and pwMS. Given the fact that no additional device is needed, smartphone accelerometry might be a convenient outcome of real-life ambulation in healthy individuals and chronic diseases such as MS.","Article","10.3389/FNEUR.2020.00688","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=16642295&id=doi:10.3389%2Ffneur.2020.00688&atitle=Smartphone+Accelerometry%3A+A+Smart+and+Reliable+Measurement+of+Real-Life+Physical+Activity+in+Multiple+Sclerosis+and+Healthy+Individuals&stitle=Front.+Neurol.&title=Frontiers+in+Neurology&volume=11&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Zhai&aufirst=Yuyang&auinit=Y.&aufull=Zhai+Y.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2020&auinit1=Y&auinitm=","Embase"

Migraine prevalence is three times higher in the MS clinic population compared to the general population, and patients with MS and migraine are more symptomatic than patients with MS without migraine. Objective: We sought to conduct a pilot feasibility and acceptability study of the RELAXaHEAD app in MS-Migraine patients and to assess whether there was any change in migraine disability and MS pain-related disability. Methods: Randomized controlled study of patients with MS-migraine ages 18–80 years with 4+ headache days/ month who were willing to engage in smartphone based behavioral therapy. Half received the RELAXaHEAD app with progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) and the other half received the app without the PMR. Data was collected for 90 days on measures of recruitment, retention, engagement, and adherence to RELAXaHEAD. Preliminary data was also collected on migraine disability (MIDAS) and MS pain (PES). Results: Sixty-two subjects with MS-migraine were enrolled in the study (34 in PMR arm, 28 in monitored usual care arm). On average, during the 90 days, participants played the PMR on average 1.8 times per week, and for 12.9 min on days it was played. Forty-one percent (14/34) of the participants played the PMR two or more times weekly on average. Data was entered into the daily diaries, on average, 49% (44/90) of the days. There were major challenges in reaching subjects in follow-up for the efficacy data, and there was no significant change in migraine disability (MIDAS) scores or MS Pain (PES) scores from baseline to the endpoints. During the six-month follow-up, most patients felt either positively or neutral about the relaxation therapy. Conclusion: There was interest in scalable accessible forms of behavioral therapy to treat migraine and MS-related pain in patients with MS and comorbid migraine. Similar to prior studies, a significant minority were willing to practice the PMR at least twice weekly. In the societal shift from telephone to more text and internet-based interactions, follow up was challenging, but those reached indicated that they appreciated the PMR and would recommend it to others.

However, examinations are resource intensive and thus not practical for comprehensive measurement of neurological disability in chronic diseases. A remote digital solution may be more practical and particularly relevant now due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Objectives: To clinically validate a digital adaptation of the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) developed as part of a smartphone test suite replicating aspects of a neurological exam. Methods: Participants consisted of healthy volunteers (HV; n=39) and multiple sclerosis (MS; n=154) patients, with a longitudinal subcohort that performed tests at home (n=15). During clinic visits, the smartphone test suite was administered alongside a full neurological exam. The smartphone SDMT featured randomization of symbol-digit code and testing sequence. The subjects also underwent written SDMT and brain MRI. Results: Performance differed significantly between HV and MS cohorts (p<.0001). Performance on smartphone and written SDMT had strong evidence of association (R(2)=0.71, concordance coefficient CCC=0.69, p<.0001). Smartphone SDMT had higher criterion validity than written SDMT measured by correlation with T2 lesion load and brain atrophy. Correlations with NeurEx subdomains identified neurological functions involved in performance of each of the 3 functional cognitive tests. Correcting for these contributing non-cognitive disabilities generated linear regression models strongly predicting the amount of MS-related brain injury measured by volumetric MRI (R2 = 0.75, p < 0.0001 vs R2 = 0.62, p < 0.0001). Of the longitudinal cohort, 87% of patients demonstrated practice effects measured by non-linear regression. Averaging multiple sequential post-learning results significantly decreased threshold for identifying true test deteriorations on a patient level.

The continuous acquisition of high sample rate data may provide unprecedented insights in short-term changes in important health outcomes in MS. Objectives: To investigate the sensitivity of KD to clinically relevant change (i.e. responsiveness) in disease activity, fatigue, and clinical disability outcomes in patients with MS. Methods: Patients with MS were recruited in this cohort study. Clinical outcomes were assessed at baseline and 3 months followup, including: MRI gadolinium-enhancing lesions (Gd-EL), patient-perceived fatigue, and clinical disability measures (Expanded Disability Status Scale, EDSS; Timed 25-foot Walk Test, TWT; Nine-Hole Peg Test, NHPT; Arm function in MS Questionnaire, AMSQ). Throughout the study, patients used the Neurokeys App which replaces the native keyboard with a smartkeyboard and unobtrusively collects time-stamped key press and release events in the real-world setting. Keystroke data of 14 days surrounding the clinical visits were aggregated for the analyses. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) was calculated to assess responsiveness of KD in classifying anchor-based change within clinical outcomes. The minimally important change (MIC) was calculated as the mean change in KD in the lower +2 SD portion (to approximate minimal change) of patients with clinically relevant change for each clinical outcome. The MIC was compared to the smallest detectable change (SDC) to assess the capability of KD to distinguish important change from measurement error. Results: 102 patients with MS were included, of whom 94 completed follow-up. Responsiveness of KD were acceptable for change in number of MRI Gd-EL (highest AUROC = 0.73) and arm function based on the AMSQ score (highest AUROCs = 0.75). KD had excellent responsiveness to change in ambulatory function measured with TWT (highest AUROC = 0.84). EDSS and NHPT had lower AUC values than KD in classifying change in Gd-EL and AMSQ, respectively. For all keystroke features the MIC exceeded the SDC with differences ranging from 3.6 to 92.4%. Conclusions: KD collected in patients with MS using the Neurokeys App demonstrated responsiveness to clinically relevant changes in gadolinium-enhancing lesions on MRI and clinical disability measures for arm and ambulatory function. Responsiveness of KD was higher than commonly used clinical measures in MS and sensitive enough to discriminate important change from measurement error.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458520974937","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458520974937&atitle=Smartphone+keystroke+dynamics+are+sensitive+to+changes+in+disease+activity+and+clinical+disability+measures+in+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=26&issue=3+SUPPL&spage=196&epage=197&aulast=Lam&aufirst=K.H.&auinit=K.H.&aufull=Lam+K.H.&coden=&isbn=&pages=196-197&date=2020&auinit1=K&auinitm=H","Embase"

We describe the Draw a Shape (DaS) Test, a smartphone-based and remotely administered test of Upper Extremity (UE) function developed for people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). This work introduces DaS-related features that characterise UE function and impairment, and aims to demonstrate how multivariate modelling of these metrics can reliably predict the 9-Hole Peg Test (9HPT), a clinician-administered UE assessment in PwMS. APPROACH: The DaS Test instructed PwMS and healthy controls (HC) to trace predefined shapes on a smartphone screen. A total of 93 subjects (HC, n = 22; PwMS, n = 71) contributed both dominant and non-dominant handed DaS tests. PwMS subjects were characterised as those with normal (nPwMS, n = 50) and abnormal UE function (aPwMS, n = 21) with respect to their average 9HPT time (≤ or > 22.7 (s), respectively). L 1-regularization techniques, combined with linear least squares (OLS, IRLS), or non-linear support vector (SVR) or random forest (RFR) regression were investigated as functions to map relevant DaS features to 9HPT times. MAIN RESULTS: It was observed that average non-dominant handed 9HPT times were more accurately predicted by DaS features (r 2 = 0.41, [Formula: see text] 0.05; MAE: 2.08 ± 0.34 (s)) than average dominant handed 9HPTs (r 2 = 0.39, [Formula: see text] 0.05; MAE: 2.32 ± 0.43 (s)), using simple linear IRLS ([Formula: see text] 0.01). Moreover, it was found that the Mean absolute error (MAE) in predicted 9HPTs was comparable to the variability of actual 9HPT times within HC, nPwMS and aPwMS groups respectively. The 9HPT however exhibited large heteroscedasticity resulting in less stable predictions of longer 9HPT times. SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrates the potential of the smartphone-based DaS Test to reliably predict 9HPT times and remotely monitor UE function in PwMS.","Article","10.1088/1361-6579/AB8771","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13616579&id=doi:10.1088%2F1361-6579%2Fab8771&atitle=Smartphone-based+remote+assessment+of+upper+extremity+function+for+multiple+sclerosis+using+the+Draw+a+Shape+Test&stitle=Physiol+Meas&title=Physiological+measurement&volume=41&issue=5&spage=054002&epage=&aulast=Creagh&aufirst=A.P.&auinit=A.P.&aufull=Creagh+A.P.&coden=&isbn=&pages=054002-&date=2020&auinit1=A&auinitm=P","Embase"

Quantifying different neurological functions in patient-autonomous manner via smartphones may remedy this problem if such tests provide reliable clinical information. Objectives: To develop the smartphone version of the Symbol- Digit Modalities Test's (SDMT) with random sequence generations and assess its ability to discern alterations of the central nervous system (CNS) tissue in MS patients in comparison to investigator-administered SDMT. To quantify practice effects in the longitudinal data. Methods: The smartphone SDMT was administered to 152 MS patients and 39 healthy volunteers (HV). On the full cohort, Spearman correlation was used to assess the agreement between smartphone versus investigator-administered form of SDMT. The test's ability to quantify biologically-meaningful alterations of the CNS tissue were evaluated using elastic net regression, where we identified the relationship between SDMT measurements and CNS tissue destruction in a sub-cohort with available volumetric MRI and digitalized neurological exams data (97 MS, 12 HV). For 11 MS patients who use smartphone SDMT weekly from home, we used non-linear regression to determine when an individual's practice effect has stopped occurring. Results: Investigator-administered and smartphone SDMT correlated highly with each other (Rho = 0.8447, p < 0.0001). The SDMT scores, when controlled for relevant clinical characteristics, were highly associated with MS lesions volume and brain parenchymal fraction, with smartphone SDMT achieving slightly better performance (R2 = 0.5767, p < 0.0001) than investigatoradministered SDMT (R2 = 0.5027, p < 0.0001). In contrast, the paced auditory serial addition test (PASAT-3) had no association with MRI volumetric features. In the longitudinal cohort, patientspecific practice effects were clearly identifiable. On average, practice effects stopped after 3 trials. Conclusions: Smartphone self-administered SDMT with random sequence generation is a reliable substitute of the traditional SDMT for measuring cognitive reaction time in MS. In longitudinal measurement, patient-specific practice effects can be identified reliably, allowing for subsequent accurate tracking of patients' cognitive performance over time.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458520917096","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458520917096&atitle=Smartphone-based+symbol-digit+modalities+test+reliably+measures+cognitive+function+in+multiple+sclerosis+patients&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=26&issue=1+SUPPL&spage=27&epage=28&aulast=Pham&aufirst=L.K.&auinit=L.K.&aufull=Pham+L.K.&coden=&isbn=&pages=27-28&date=2020&auinit1=L&auinitm=K","Embase"

Materials and Methods The sample consisted of 30 persons with mild-to-moderate PD and 30 controls matched by age and sex. Participants performed a 6-minute bout of over-ground walking at comfortable speed, and then completed three, 6-minute bouts of treadmill walking at 13.4 m/min slower, comfortable, and 13.4 m/min faster than comfortable speeds. The three treadmill speeds were based on the initial over-ground walking speed. The total number of steps per treadmill walking bout was recorded using a hand-tally counter, and energy expenditure was measured using a portable, indirect spirometry system. Results The results indicated a strong association between step-rate and energy expenditure for persons with PD (R-2 = .92) and controls (R-2 = .92). The analyses further indicated a steeper slope of the association for persons with PD compared with controls (t(58) = -1.87, P .05), resulting in a lower step-rate threshold (t(58) = 2.19, P < .05) for persons with PD (similar to 80 steps center dot per minutes) than controls (similar to 93 steps center dot per minutes). Conclusion Collectively, these results support the application of this disease-specific step-rate threshold for MVPA among persons with PD. This has important implications for physical activity promotion, prescription, and monitoring using accelerometers and pedometers for persons with PD to manage health and symptoms of PD.","Article","10.1111/ANE.13250","WOS:000527385300001","WoS"

The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and the standard 6-minute walk test (6MWT) are not able to detect small features and the variety in quality of gait. Use of wearable sensors might be a useful clinical tool for objective measurements of gait function and might support individualized rehabilitation. We present preliminary data from a pilot study performed at the MS Center Hakadal (MSSH) in 2019. Method: Fifteen pwMS (EDSS: 1.5-5.0) performed a 6MWT with a wearable motion sensor (three axis accelerometer and gyroscope from GaitUpR, Lausanne, Switzerland) attached to each foot. Gait parameters (e.g. step length, cadence) were calculated using the validated gait analysis software from GaitUpR. Results: The 6MWT correlated only moderately with EDSS (R2 = 0.54) showing large variations within EDSS scores. The step variability was similar for EDSS <3.5 but showed larger variation with EDSS ?3.5, with a trend of higher variability for higher EDSS. The path length (3D distance moved by the foot during a step) correlated well with the 6MWT score (R2 = 0.82), but only moderately with EDSS (R2 = 0.56). Conclusion: In this pilot study, the gait function in pwMS showed large variations within each EDSS score which therefore only moderately correlated with the 6MWT. This suggest a need for a better score to pinpoint the gait function of pwMS, and a more personalized, objective evaluation of gait parameters. Experiences gained through this pilot study have been useful in tailoring the rehabilitation program for individual patients to improve gait function. However, more research with a larger number of pwMS is necessary to gain more insight into the gait parameters of pwMS and their correlations with current clinical standards.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458520969077","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458520969077&atitle=Stine+Marit+Moen+Use+of+sensors+in+MS+rehabilitation-+A+pilot+study&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=26&issue=2+SUPPL&spage=23&epage=&aulast=Berg-Hansen&aufirst=Pal&auinit=P.&aufull=Berg-Hansen+P.&coden=&isbn=&pages=23-&date=2020&auinit1=P&auinitm=","Embase"

Currently, it has affected more than 2,850,000 people. No vaccine or drug is available yet, and therefore researchers and scientists are striving to identify potential drugs or vaccines for combating this virus. We were unable to find any review of the literature or analysis on ongoing registered clinical trials that reported diagnostic tests, therapeutics, vaccines and devices for COVID-19 along with estimated enrollment, participants’ ages, study type, start and completion date, status, treatment/intervention and country. OBJECTIVE: To review ongoing trials relating to COVID-19. METHODS: A systematic search for clinical trials was conducted in the ClinicalTrials.gov database up to April 12, 2020. A total of 339 trials relating to COVID-19 were analyzed and key information on each trial was recorded. RESULTS: Most of the trials were being conducted in the United States and completion of most of them was expected by May 2020. They were mostly on drugs and treatment, while a minority were on diagnostic tests. The analysis showed that hydroxychloroquine was investigated in most of the trials. The trials identified were categorized into five classes: a) diagnostic tests; b) therapeutics; c) biologics and vaccines; d) devices and products; and e) others. CONCLUSION: The trials identified have potential against COVID-19 that can be applied in treatment processes after the necessary investigations and experiments. Additionally, the items identified were organized in a proper way, which can assist in current research activities.","Review","10.1590/1516-3180.2020.0208.R1.15062020","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=15163180&id=doi:10.1590%2F1516-3180.2020.0208.R1.15062020&atitle=Study+of+ongoing+registered+clinical+trials+on+covid-19%3A+A+narrative+review&stitle=Sao+Paulo+Med.+J.&title=Sao+Paulo+Medical+Journal&volume=138&issue=5&spage=441&epage=456&aulast=Rabby&aufirst=Md+Insiat+Islam&auinit=M.I.I.&aufull=Rabby+M.I.I.&coden=SPMJB&isbn=&pages=441-456&date=2020&auinit1=M&auinitm=I.I.","Embase"

Reasons for this are the associated loss of voluntary motor function, inefficient temperature regulation of the affected extremities, and early muscle fatigue. Hydrotherapy or swim training offer an inherent weight relief, reduce spasticity and improve coordination, muscle strength and fitness. Methods: We present a new hybrid exercise modality that combines functional electrical stimulation (FES) of the knee extensors and transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (tSCS) with paraplegic front crawl swimming. tSCS is used to stimulate the afferent fibers of the L2-S2 posterior roots for spasticity reduction. By activating the tSCS, the trunk musculature is recruited at a motor level. This shall improve trunk stability and straighten the upper body. Within this feasibility study, two complete SCI subjects (both Asia scale A, lesion level Th5/6), who have been proficient front crawl swimmers, conducted a 10-week swim training with stimulation support. In an additional assessment swim session nine months after the training, the knee extension, hip extension, and trunk roll angles where measured using waterproof inertial measurement units (IMUs) and compared for different swimming conditions (no stimulation, tSCS, FES, FES plus tSCS). Results: For both subjects, a training effect over the 10-week swim training was observed in terms of measured lap times (16 m pool) for all swimming conditions. Swimming supported by FES reduced lap times by 15.4% and 8.7% on average for Subject A and Subject B, respectively. Adding tSCS support yielded even greater mean decreases of 19.3% and 20.9% for Subjects A and B, respectively. Additionally, both subjects individually reported that swimming with tSCS for 30-45 minutes eliminated spasticity in the lower extremities for up to 4 hours beyond the duration of the session. Comparing the median as well as the interquartile range of all different settings, the IMU-based motion analysis revealed that FES as well as FES+tSCS improve knee extension in both subjects, while hip extension was only increased in one subject. Trunk roll angles were similar for all swimming conditions. tSCS had no influence on the knee and hip joint angles. Both subjects reported that stimulation-assisted swimming is comfortable, enjoyable, and they would like to use such a device for recreational training and rehabilitation in the future. Conclusions: Stimulation-assisted swimming seems to be a promising new form of hybrid exercise for SCI people. It is safe to use with reusable silicone electrodes and can be performed independently by experienced paraplegic swimmers except for transfer to water. The study results indicate that swimming speed can be increased by the proposed methods and spasticity can be reduced by prolonged swim sessions with tSCS and FES. The combination of stimulation with hydrotherapy might be a promising therapy for neurologic rehabilitation in incomplete SCI, stroke or multiples sclerosis patients. Therefore, further studies shall incorporate other neurologic disorders and investigate the potential benefits of FES and tSCS therapy in the water for gait and balance.","Article","10.1186/S12984-020-00682-6","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=17430003&id=doi:10.1186%2Fs12984-020-00682-6&atitle=Supporting+front+crawl+swimming+in+paraplegics+using+electrical+stimulation%3A+A+feasibility+study&stitle=J.+NeuroEng.+Rehabil.&title=Journal+of+NeuroEngineering+and+Rehabilitation&volume=17&issue=1&spage=&epage=&aulast=Wiesener&aufirst=Constantin&auinit=C.&aufull=Wiesener+C.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2020&auinit1=C&auinitm=","Embase"

The Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) is widely used to formally quantify CPS. We implemented a variant of the SDMT in MS sherpa, a smartphone app for persons with MS. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the construct validity and test-retest reliability of the MS sherpa smartphone variant of the SDMT (sSDMT). METHODS: We performed a validation study with 25 persons with relapsing-remitting MS and 79 healthy control (HC) subjects. In the HC group, 21 subjects were matched to the persons with MS with regard to age, gender, and education and they followed the same assessment schedule as the persons with MS (the """"HC matched"""" group) and 58 subjects had a less intense assessment schedule to determine reference values (the """"HC normative"""" group). Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were determined between the paper-and-pencil SDMT and its smartphone variant (sSDMT) on 2 occasions, 4 weeks apart. Other ICCs were determined for test-retest reliability, which were derived from 10 smartphone tests per study participant, with 3 days in between each test. Seven study participants with MS were interviewed regarding their experiences with the sSDMT. RESULTS: The SDMT scores were on average 12.06% higher than the sSDMT scores, with a standard deviation of 10.68%. An ICC of 0.838 was found for the construct validity of the sSDMT in the combined analysis of persons with MS and HC subjects. Average ICCs for test-retest reliability of the sSDMT for persons with MS, the HC matched group, and the HC normative group were 0.874, 0.857, and 0.867, respectively. The practice effect was significant between the first and the second test of the persons with MS and the HC matched group and trivial for all other test-retests. The interviewed study participants expressed a positive attitude toward the sSDMT, but they also discussed the importance of adapting a smartphone cognition test in accordance with the needs of the individual persons with MS. CONCLUSIONS: The high correlation between sSDMT and the conventional SDMT scores indicates a very good construct validity. Similarly, high correlations underpin a very good test-retest reliability of the sSDMT. We conclude that the sSDMT has the potential to be used as a tool to monitor CPS in persons with MS, both in clinical studies and in clinical practice.","Article","10.2196/18160","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=22915222&id=doi:10.2196%2F18160&atitle=Symbol+Digit+Modalities+Test+Variant+in+a+Smartphone+App+for+Persons+With+Multiple+Sclerosis%3A+Validation+Study&stitle=JMIR+Mhealth+Uhealth&title=JMIR+mHealth+and+uHealth&volume=8&issue=10&spage=e18160&epage=&aulast=van+Oirschot&aufirst=Pim&auinit=P.&aufull=van+Oirschot+P.&coden=&isbn=&pages=e18160-&date=2020&auinit1=P&auinitm=","Embase"

To compare accuracy of various machine learning classifiers. To find the most suitable sensor location for ataxia classification. Background: Gait ataxia is caused by various neurological diseases which affect cerebellum, brain stem and spinal cord and significantly contributes to patients disability. Wireless motion tracking devices along with complex motion analysis has a big potential in early diagnostics and further patient monitoring. In case of walking various parametres such as stride time, step length, rhythm, joint angles and symmetry are used for pathological gait patterns recognition. Perception Neuron is a commercial wearable device containing 32 sensors each composed of gyroscope, accelerometer and magnetometer. Design/Methods: Group of 7 patients with gait ataxia in spinocerebellar type of multiple sclerosis and 7 healthy volunteers were recorded by 'Perception Neuron' while walking. Each recording was divided into several shorter (20s) parts counting 139 segments in total. Power spectral density of accelerometric data was classified by Support Vector Machine, Bayesian Analysis, K-Nearest Neighbours and Neural Networks. Accuraccy for different sensor locations were compared. Results: Best accuracy for different sensors locations was achieved on head, neck and shoulders (up to 99.6%). Accuracy of different classifiers in these locations were comparable with maximal difference 1.8%. The worst results were on feet (65-88%, depending on the classification method) and shanks (76-86%). Conclusions: The evaluation of ataxic walking using motion sensors is a sensitive method, which depends on the location of the sensors. The best accuracy can be achieved by the sensors which are the most distant from the ground. The most likely explanation is the increase of the signal / noise ratio. Noise is comparable for all sensors, while the amplitude of compensatory oscillations increases with distance from the ground.","Conference Abstract",NA,"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=1526632X&id=doi:&atitle=The+best+motion+sensor+localization+for+ataxic+gait+assessment&stitle=Neurology&title=Neurology&volume=94&issue=15&spage=&epage=&aulast=Dostal&aufirst=Ondrej&auinit=O.&aufull=Dostal+O.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2020&auinit1=O&auinitm=","Embase"

Technological advances in biomechanics offer objective assessments of gait disabilities in clinical settings. Here we employed wearable sensors to measure electromyography (EMG) and body acceleration during walking and to quantify the altered gait pattern between people with progressive MS (PwPMS) and healthy controls (HCs). Forty consecutive patients attending our department as in-patients were examined together with fifteen healthy controls. All subjects performed the timed 10 min walking test (T10MW) using a wearable accelerator and 8 electrodes attached to bilateral thighs and legs so that body acceleration and EMG activity were recorded. The T10MWs were recorded under three conditions: standard (wearing shoes), reduced grip (wearing socks) and increased cognitive load (backward-counting dual-task). PwPMS showed worse kinematics of gait and increased muscle coactivation than controls at both the thigh and leg levels. Both reduced grip and increased cognitive load caused a reduction in the cadence and velocity of the T10MW, which were correlated with one another. A higher coactivation index at the thigh level of the more affected side was positively correlated with the time of the T10MW (r = 0.5, p < 0.01), Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) (r = 0.4, p < 0.05), and negatively correlated with the cadence (r = -0.6, p < 0.001). Our results suggest that excessive coactivation at the thigh level is the major determinant of the gait performance as the disease progresses. Moreover, demanding walking conditions do not influence gait in controls but deteriorate walking performances in PwPMS, thus those conditions should be prevented during hospital examinations as well as in homecare environments.","Article","10.3390/S20216160","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14248220&id=doi:10.3390%2Fs20216160&atitle=The+Danger+of+Walking+with+Socks%3A+Evidence+from+Kinematic+Analysis+in+People+with+Progressive+Multiple+Sclerosis&stitle=Sensors+%28Basel%29&title=Sensors+%28Basel%2C+Switzerland%29&volume=20&issue=21&spage=&epage=&aulast=Huang&aufirst=Su-Chun&auinit=S.-C.&aufull=Huang+S.-C.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2020&auinit1=S&auinitm=-C","Embase"

It is important to detect even slightest walking impairments in order to start and optimize necessary interventions in time to counteract further progression of the disability. For this reason, a regular monitoring through gait analysis is highly necessary. At advanced stages of MS with significant walking impairment, this assessment is also necessary to optimize symptomatic treatment, choose the most suitable walking aid and plan individualized rehabilitation. In clinical practice, walking impairment is only assessed at higher levels of the disease using e.g., the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). In contrast to the EDSS, standardized functional tests such as walking speed, walking endurance and balance as well as walking quality and gait-related patient-reported outcomes allow a more holistic and sensitive assessment of walking impairment. In recent years, the MS Center Dresden has established a standardized monitoring procedure for the routine multidimensional assessment of gait and balance disorders. In the following protocol, we present the techniques and procedures for the analysis of gait and balance of people with MS at the MS Center Dresden. Patients are assessed with a multidimensional gait analysis at least once a year. This enables long-term monitoring of walking impairment, which allows early active intervention regarding further progression of disease and improves the current standard clinical practice.","Note","10.3389/FNINS.2020.582046","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=1662453X&id=doi:10.3389%2Ffnins.2020.582046&atitle=The+Dresden+Protocol+for+Multidimensional+Walking+Assessment+%28DMWA%29+in+Clinical+Practice&stitle=Front.+Neurosci.&title=Frontiers+in+Neuroscience&volume=14&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Trentzsch&aufirst=Katrin&auinit=K.&aufull=Trentzsch+K.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2020&auinit1=K&auinitm=","Embase"

Material: An exercise program was applied to 54 university students (17 males, 37 females) between October and November 2019. The five exercises lasted approximately 15-20 minutes in each training session (diaphragmatic breathing, axial neck extension, cervical stabilization, pectoral stretch, and shoulder retractor strengthening) that was performed 5 times a day, 5 days a week for 5 weeks. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Neck Disability Index (NDI), Forward Head Posture (FHP), number of daily steps, sitting time, sleep time, and smartphone usage time were compared before and after the exercise program. The Paired Samples t-test was used to compare differences between the pre-exercise and post-exercise variables. Statistical significance level was set at 0.05. Results: Following the 5-week exercise program, sleep quality improved, and levels of neck disability and fatigue were lower and the differences were statistically significant (p<0.05).

The efficacy of SVT has never been examined in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS), therefore, our aim was to examine the immediate effect of SVT on cognitive function, gait and static balance performance in PwMS. This assessor-blinded, randomized crossover study included 26 PwMS, 16 females, mean age 47.9 and median EDSS score 4.5. Participants attended two sessions: SVT and control training. Exercises for both the SVT and control sessions were based on ball-catching tasks. Training sessions were identical in length (40–50 min) and type of exercise drills. The difference between the two practice regimes was that the SVT session was performed wearing stroboscopic glasses and the control training was performed with similar glasses without lenses. Cognition was evaluated by a computerized software (Mindstreams(®), NeuroTrax Corp., NY). Gait and balance were evaluated via wearable accelerometers (APDM, Oregon, USA). Outcome measures were collected twice during a single session, prior to training and immediately afterward. Information processing speed (p = 0.003) increased at the post-evaluation compared with baseline, solely in the SVT session. No differences between pre–post evaluations were observed for other cognitive scores following the SVT session. No differences between pre–post measurements were noted for gait and balance following the SVT session.

Background: Because of the high variability of MS clinical onset, evolution, phenotypes and mechanisms, the longitudinal assessment of this disease and its progression remain to this date a challenge for Neurologists worldwide. Design/Methods: We included 20 MS patients followed at the Nantes University Hospital(France) and included in the 'Myo Project' study, from January to December 2018. While wearing the MYO armband, patients performed several clinical tests, including clinical EDSS, Timed 25-foot Walk test, Romberg maneuver, Heel-Knee test and filled autoquestionnaires including a patient EDSS (pEDSS). We analysed data from the 3 dimension inertial measurement unit (gyroscope and accelerometer) and the surface electromyogram (sEMG) included in the MYO. Results: 20 patients presenting with remitting-recurring MS and 5 healthy controls matched with sex and age were included in this study. The mean rotation speed measured with the gyroscope sensor, increased with the severity of the disease along the X, Y and Z axis; r(x)=0.558, r(y)=0.328, r(z)=0.443 and respectively p=0.00029, p=0.000298, p=0.0003 for the Romberg maneuver. There was a significant negative correlation between the linear acceleration measured with the accelerometer along the X-axis, r(x)=-0.731 (p=0.030) and Y-axis, r(y)=-0.273 (p=0.0002) and a positive correlation along the Z axis, r(z)=0.792 (p=10 ) for the 25-foot walk test. The pEDSS responses were correlated with the cEDSS. A big data analytics approach of raw data obtained with the sEMG allows to differentiate MS patients from healthy controls.

Methods: Each member of the Italian Society of Neurology (SIN) participated in an online survey (January to May 2018) to collect information on their attitude toward digital health. Results: Four hundred and five neurologists participated in the study. At work, 95% of responders use the personal computer, 87% the smartphone, and 43.5% the tablet. These devices are used to obtain health information (91%), maintain contact with colleagues (71%), provide clinical information (59%), and receive updates (67%).

The aim of this study is to assess the existence of possible sex-related differences in functional mobility in pwMS, also considering the muscular strength capacity. Methods: Functional mobility and hand-grip strength (HGS) were assessed in 49 pwMS with mild-moderate disability using instrumental Timed-up-and-go (TUG) test carried out using an inertial sensor and digital dynamometry. We investigated the existence of sex-related differences in the duration of each TUG sub-phase and their correlation with the HGS. Results: No sex-related differences in TUG performance (either in terms of overall or sub-phase time) were found. Similar large negative correlations were found in men and women with MS between HGS and overall TUG and walking phase duration. However, changes in strength have a more marked impact in women as indicated by the different slope of the HGS-TUG time relationship., In women, HGS also appears significantly correlated with all TUG sub-phases, while in men this occurs only for overall TUG and walking time.

Vidofludimus calcium (IMU-838) is a selective and potent second- generation DHODH oral immunomodulator being developed for the treatment of several immune-mediated diseases including MS and COVID-19. The inhibition of the DHODH enzyme leads to metabolic stress in stimulated lymphocytes with subsequent reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and induction of apoptosis. Due to IMU-838's pharmacological selectivity and lack of relevant off-target effects on kinases, increased rates of typical antiproliferative effects (neutropenia, alopecia and gastrointestinal disturbances) have not been observed in clinical trials. The serum half-life of approximately 30 hours allows quick on- and off-dosing. Objectives: To report topline efficacy, safety, and tolerability of IMU-838 in the relapsing MS EMPhASIS trial (NCT03846219), the first trial of IMU-838 in MS. Methods: EMPhASIS is a phase 2 multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel-group trial to assess the efficacy and safety of two once-daily oral doses of IMU-838 (30 and 45 mg/day) in patients with RRMS. Inclusion criteria are age 18-55 years, active RRMS defined by the evidence of clinical and radiological disease activity, and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) 0-4. The primary endpoint is the cumulative number of combined unique active MRI lesions over 24 weeks. Secondary endpoints include efficacy, safety and tolerability parameters. The study also includes a subsequent optional, open-label treatment period to evaluate long-term safety and tolerability. Results: 210 subjects (65% women) were enrolled in 36 centers across four European countries.

Findings: Multiple gait stability index metrics were significantly correlated with clinical measures of disability and mobility in multiple sclerosis subjects (r = 0.354–0.528), but no correlations were found for sensorimotor delays or lower extremity sensation. Multiple gait stability indices performed at least as well as clinical questionnaires for separating fallers from non-fallers. Interpretation: The gait stability indices can potentially be used outside of a laboratory setting to measure walking characteristics related to fall history and disability level in people with multiple sclerosis.","Article","10.1016/J.CLINBIOMECH.2020.105100","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=18791271&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.clinbiomech.2020.105100&atitle=Trunk+and+foot+acceleration+variability+during+walking+relates+to+fall+history+and+clinical+disability+in+persons+with+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Clin.+Biomech.&title=Clinical+Biomechanics&volume=80&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Craig&aufirst=Jordan+J.&auinit=J.J.&aufull=Craig+J.J.&coden=CLBIE&isbn=&pages=-&date=2020&auinit1=J&auinitm=J","Embase"

This project examined the utility of a head-worn inertial measurement unit (IMU) to quantify head movement frequency, velocity, and amplitude during gaze stability exercises. METHODS: Twenty-eight individuals with multiple sclerosis and complaints of dizziness or a history of falls were randomly assigned to either a strength and aerobic exercise (SAE) or gaze and postural stability (GPS) group. During a 6-week intervention, participants wore a head-mounted IMU 3 times (early, middle, and late). For aim 1, the frequency, mean peak velocity, and mean peak amplitude of head turns during equivalent duration components of group-specific exercises were compared using general linear models. For aim 2, the progression of treatment in the GPS group was examined using general linear regression models for each outcome. RESULTS: Aim 1 revealed the GPS group demonstrated significantly greater velocity and amplitude head turns during treatment than the SAE group. The frequency of head turns did not significantly differ between the 2 groups. The aim 2 analyses demonstrated that the yaw and pitch frequency of head turns significantly increased during gaze stability exercises over the 6-week intervention. Velocity and amplitude of head turns during yaw and pitch gaze stability exercises did not significantly change. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: A head-worn IMU during rehabilitation distinguished between groups. Furthermore, within the GPS group, the IMU quantified the progression of the frequency of head movements during gaze stability exercises over time.Video Abstract available for more insights from the authors (see the Video, Supplemental Digital Content 1, available at: http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A320).","Article","10.1097/NPT.0000000000000329","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=15570584&id=doi:10.1097%2FNPT.0000000000000329&atitle=Turning+Toward+Monitoring+of+Gaze+Stability+Exercises%3A+The+Utility+of+Wearable+Sensors&stitle=J+Neurol+Phys+Ther&title=Journal+of+neurologic+physical+therapy+%3A+JNPT&volume=44&issue=4&spage=261&epage=267&aulast=Loyd&aufirst=Brian+J.&auinit=B.J.&aufull=Loyd+B.J.&coden=&isbn=&pages=261-267&date=2020&auinit1=B&auinitm=J","Embase"

In order to assess the relative sensitivity of real-world activity levels for detection of disease progression and/or treatment response compared with in-clinic assessments, we are using wearable digital biosensors to passively collect activity data in 2 multiple sclerosis (MS) clinical trials. Objectives: To assess patient biosensor compliance and the potential of real-world digital biosensor data to assess MS disease progression and/or treatment response Methods: Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 52-week Phase 2 clinical trials are currently evaluating the efficacy and safety of elezanumab in subjects with relapsing (RADIUS-R, NCT03737851) or progressive (RADIUS-P, NCT03737812) forms of MS. The primary efficacy assessment is performed in-clinic every 12 weeks. To generate real-world activity data, subjects wore MC10's BioStamp nPoint® biosensors over 7-day intervals at Baseline and Weeks 24, 36, and 52. The sensors (chest, thigh and calf locations) monitor gait speed, step count and overall activity, including vital signs. Study sites were trained to apply, charge and reapply biosensors by MC10, and site staff trained subjects. Compliance was measured by the percentage of sensor wear days out of the instructed wear days. Results: As of April 9, 2020, RADIUS-R had enrolled 208 subjects, RADIUS-P had enrolled 123 and 119,00 hours of actigraphy data were collected. Interim compliance rates for subjects completing each interval in RADIUS-R and RADIUS-P respectively were: Baseline (n=188, 101%; n=88, 94%), Week 24 (n=84, 99%; n=21, 86%), Week 36 (n=28, 104%; n=5, 103%), Week 52 (n=4, 79%; n=1, 114%). The average compliance rate across the studies and timepoints was 98%. All treatment-blinded actigraphy data were uploaded to the MC10 cloud for review. The objective at the completion of the studies is to determine differences between treatment groups in relation to clinical endpoints. Conclusions: To our knowledge, these are the first randomized MS clinical trials to incorporate BioStamp biosensors to capture real-world activity. There was a high level of compliance to-date across study sites for the subjects that have completed one or more 7-day intervals, suggesting use is not overly burdensome.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458520974937","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458520974937&atitle=Use+of+wearable+biosensors+to+collect+real-world+patient+activity+data+in+two+randomized+phase+2+studies+of+elezanumab+in+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=26&issue=3+SUPPL&spage=203&epage=204&aulast=Pfleeger&aufirst=K.&auinit=K.&aufull=Pfleeger+K.&coden=&isbn=&pages=203-204&date=2020&auinit1=K&auinitm=","Embase"

Frequently interrupting sedentary time might help to mitigate the associated detrimental health consequences. The purpose of this article was to describe the process followed in the systematic development and implementation of a theory- and home-based sedentary behavior change intervention for people with stroke. The Intervention Mapping protocol was used to design, develop and implement a ST and Up Frequently From Stroke (STUFFS) program aimed at reducing prolonged sedentary behavior after stroke. A qualitative inquiry with people with stroke (n = 13) informed the development of the intervention. The systematic approach followed in the development process including the theoretical basis, content development, and evaluation planning were described. Program reception was assessed using thematic content analysis of exit-interview data (n = 25). The 8-weeks STUFFS intervention is a home-based sedentary behavior change program that provides education about the risks of prolonged sedentary behavior and facilitates behavior change, including the use of motivational tools to empower people with stroke to reduce sedentary behavior. The program was well-received and acceptable to people with stroke (89% satisfaction). This article provides information that furthers knowledge about theory-based strategies to reduce sedentary behavior in the home environment after stroke and facilitates implementation of this type of intervention.","Article","10.1093/TBM/IBY128","WOS:000548355400011","WoS"

An objective and quantitative means of passively monitoring the impact and response of these interventions at a local level is needed. Objective: We aim to explore the utility of the recently developed open-source mobile health platform Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse (RADAR)–base as a toolbox to rapidly test the effect and response to NPIs intended to limit the spread of COVID-19. Methods: We analyzed data extracted from smartphone and wearable devices, and managed by the RADAR-base from 1062 participants recruited in Italy, Spain, Denmark, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. We derived nine features on a daily basis including time spent at home, maximum distance travelled from home, the maximum number of Bluetooth-enabled nearby devices (as a proxy for physical distancing), step count, average heart rate, sleep duration, bedtime, phone unlock duration, and social app use duration. We performed Kruskal-Wallis tests followed by post hoc Dunn tests to assess differences in these features among baseline, prelockdown, and during lockdown periods. We also studied behavioral differences by age, gender, BMI, and educational background. Results: We were able to quantify expected changes in time spent at home, distance travelled, and the number of nearby Bluetooth-enabled devices between prelockdown and during lockdown periods (P<.001 for all five countries). We saw reduced sociality as measured through mobility features and increased virtual sociality through phone use. People were more active on their phones (P<.001 for Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom), spending more time using social media apps (P<.001 for Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands), particularly around major news events. Furthermore, participants had a lower heart rate (P<.001 for Italy and Spain; P=.02 for Denmark), went to bed later (P<.001 for Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands), and slept more (P<.001 for Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom). We also found that young people had longer homestay than older people during the lockdown and fewer daily steps. Although there was no significant difference between the high and low BMI groups in time spent at home, the low BMI group walked more. Conclusions: RADAR-base, a freely deployable data collection platform leveraging data from wearables and mobile technologies, can be used to rapidly quantify and provide a holistic view of behavioral changes in response to public health interventions as a result of infectious outbreaks such as COVID-19. RADAR-base may be a viable approach to implementing an early warning system for passively assessing the local compliance to interventions in epidemics and pandemics, and could help countries ease out of lockdown.","Article","10.2196/19992","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14388871&id=doi:10.2196%2F19992&atitle=Using+smartphones+and+wearable+devices+to+monitor+behavioral+changes+during+COVID-19&stitle=J.+Med.+Internet+Res.&title=Journal+of+Medical+Internet+Research&volume=22&issue=9&spage=&epage=&aulast=Sun&aufirst=Shaoxiong&auinit=S.&aufull=Sun+S.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2020&auinit1=S&auinitm=","Embase"

However, altered gait patterns may impede valid step detection. We determined step detection accuracy of activity trackers and smartphones among pwMS with and without walking AIDS. Methods: Participants completed three over-ground walking trials (150 or 250 steps) with different walking speeds (comfortable/slow/fast), wearing nine activity trackers (wrist: Fitbit Inspire/Ionic, Garmin Vivofit/Vivomove, Withings Pulse/Steel, Xiaomi Mi Band, Samsung Galaxy Watch Active; waist and ankle: Fitbit Inspire, waist: ActiGraph wGT3X-BT), and three smartphones (Samsung Galaxy S10e, Nokia 8, Sony Xperia 10). Smartphone acceleration data was analyzed using a zero-crossing detection algorithm. Criterion measure was observed steps. Mean percentage of steps detected, and standard deviation were calculated for participants using/not using walking AIDS. Results: 20 pwMS (age=43±13; EDSS median=2.75; 85% female; RRMS/SPMS = 3/1) participated. In participants without walking AIDS (n=15) wrist-worn devices detected between 91.35% (±18.00%, Withings Steel) and 99.19% (±2.29%, Garmin Vivomove) of steps. Waist-worn Fitbit detected 99.08% (±12.35%) and ActiGraph 100.06% (±1.06%), smartphones between 97.61% (±13.03%, Samsung) and 99.37% (±2.81%, Nokia). The ankle-worn Fitbit detected 99.28% (±2.24%) of steps. For pwMS using walking AIDS wrist-worn devices ranged from 46.39% (±46.81%, Garmin Vivofit) to 73.55% (±45.77%, Fitbit Inspire). The waist-worn Fitbit detected 92.38% (±43.05%) and the ActiGraph 104.48% (±11.38%). Smartphones ranged from 104.35% (±13.12%, Nokia) to 98.69% (± 2.61%, Samsung). The ankle-worn Fitbit detected 98.18% (±2.85%) of steps. Results are preliminary. Conclusions: All devices detected steps with satisfactory accuracy in pwMS without walking aid. When using walking AIDS, wrist-worn devices underestimated steps considerably, whereas smartphones and the ankle-worn Fitbit were as accurate as the research-grade ActiGraph. Thus, consumer devices appear promising for valid free-living mobility and activity evaluation, even in severely affected pwMS. Further studies analyzing free-living conditions are warranted.","Conference Abstract","10.1177/1352458520969077","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14770970&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458520969077&atitle=Validity+of+step+detection+in+persons+with+MS%3A+Evaluation+of+activity+trackers+and+a+disease-specific+algorithm+using+smartphone+data&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+J.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+Journal&volume=26&issue=2+SUPPL&spage=38&epage=&aulast=Hartung&aufirst=Verena&auinit=V.&aufull=Hartung+V.&coden=&isbn=&pages=38-&date=2020&auinit1=V&auinitm=","Embase"

Currently approved treatments have several shortcomings. Consequently, new and effective treatments with improved safety and convenience profiles are sought after by patients. Objective: To explore the overall profile of vidofludimus for the treatment of RRMS. Methods: Preclinical investigations were done exploring the species-dependency of DHODH inhibition of vidofludimus. In addition, the preclinical efficacy in a rat experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model and the inhibition of cytokine release from activated PBMC were investigated. Pharmacokinetic data were also obtained in a Phase 1 multiple ascending dose trial of the formulation IMU–838 (vidofludimus calcium). Results: It was shown that vidofludimus is 2.6 times more potent in inhibiting DHO oxidation by human DHODH compared to teriflunomide. Although both compounds increased cell apoptosis, vidofludimus was more efficacious in the inhibition of T-lymphocyte proliferation compared to teriflunomide. The same was also observed for the secretion of IL–17 and IFN–γ. Interestingly, the potency or vidofludimus to inhibit rat or mouse DHODH is 7.5 and 64.4 time lower than the for the human DHODH, respectively. The rat EAE study clearly exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of cumulative disease scores by vidofludimus. In the multiple ascending dose Phase 1 clinical trial, the serum half-life of about 30 h provides a favorable profile for once daily dosing of IMU–838, with quick dosing to steady state through levels within 5 days and the ability to wash out drug quickly, if required. Conclusions: The investigations highlighted that the desired selective immunomodulatory properties can be separated from general antiproliferative effects seen and related adverse events in first-generation DHODH inhibitors. Based on data obtained from a series of pre-clinical as well as phase 1 and phase 2 studies, IMU–838 is a promising next-generation candidate for the oral treatment of RRMS. However, this will need to be confirmed in the currently ongoing Phase 2 study in RRMS patients.","Article","10.1016/J.MSARD.2020.102129","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=22110356&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.msard.2020.102129&atitle=Vidofludimus+calcium%2C+a+next+generation+DHODH+inhibitor+for+the+Treatment+of+relapsing-remitting+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+Relat.+Disord.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+and+Related+Disorders&volume=43&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Muehler&aufirst=Andreas&auinit=A.&aufull=Muehler+A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2020&auinit1=A&auinitm=","Embase"

InertiaLocoGraphy, the quantification of gait with inertial measurement units (IMUs), has been found useful to detect early changes in gait in MS. Still, the potential use of IMUs as a reliable biomarker of disease severity in MS remains unknown. Objective: This systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies aimed to describe IMU protocols used to assess gait in MS patients and calculate the effect sizes of IMU features associated with disease severity scale measures. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, Cochrane Central, EMBASE and grey literature to identify articles published before May 2, 2018 that measured gait in MS patients by using IMUs and correlated IMU parameters with disease severity scale measures. We excluded from the meta-analysis articles that did not provide enough data to evaluate the association between IMU parameters and disease severity scale measures. The study was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews on May 2, 2018 (Registration: CRD42018092651) and the protocol was published in Systematic Reviews on January 8, 2019. Results: We included 36 articles in the systematic review and pooled 12 for the meta-analysis. The risk of bias was moderate, with only 2 articles (none included in the meta-analysis) showing a bias score < 50%. Among protocols tested, 2 were predominant (the Timed Up and Go test and 6-min walk test). Speed, step length and step time with IMUs were significantly correlated with the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score, and speed and step length were significantly correlated with the Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale-12 score. Conclusion: IMU measurement has the potential to increase the sensitivity of clinical and performance tests to identify evolution in gait alteration in MS. Kinematic parameters easily accessible with IMUs, such as speed, step length and step duration, can help follow up disease severity in MS individuals with low to medium EDSS score (1.0–4.5).","Short Survey","10.1016/J.REHAB.2019.07.004","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=18770665&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.rehab.2019.07.004&atitle=Wearable+inertial+sensors+provide+reliable+biomarkers+of+disease+severity+in+multiple+sclerosis%3A+A+systematic+review+and+meta-analysis&stitle=Ann.+Phys.+Rehabil.+Med.&title=Annals+of+Physical+and+Rehabilitation+Medicine&volume=63&issue=2&spage=138&epage=147&aulast=Vienne-Jumeau&aufirst=Ali%C3%A9nor&auinit=A.&aufull=Vienne-Jumeau+A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=138-147&date=2020&auinit1=A&auinitm=","Embase"

This study aims to identify reliable and objective gait-based biomarkers to monitor progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) in clinical settings. During routine clinical visits, 57 people with secondary progressive MS and 24 healthy controls walked for 6 minutes wearing three inertial motion sensors. Fifteen gait measures were computed from the sensor data and tested for between-session reliability, for differences between controls and people with moderate and severe MS disability, and for correlation with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores. The majority of gait measures showed good to excellent between-session reliability when assessed in a subgroup of 23 healthy controls and 25 people with MS. These measures showed that people with MS walked with significantly longer step and stride durations, reduced step and stride regularity, and experienced difficulties in controlling and maintaining a stable walk when compared to controls. These abnormalities significantly increased in people with a higher level of disability and correlated with their EDSS scores. Reliable and objective gait-based biomarkers using wearable sensors have been identified. These biomarkers may allow clinicians to quantify clinically relevant alterations in gait in people with progressive MS within the context of regular clinical visits.","Article","10.1007/S00415-020-09928-8","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14321459&id=doi:10.1007%2Fs00415-020-09928-8&atitle=Wearable+sensors+can+reliably+quantify+gait+alterations+associated+with+disability+in+people+with+progressive+multiple+sclerosis+in+a+clinical+setting&stitle=J.+Neurol.&title=Journal+of+Neurology&volume=267&issue=10&spage=2897&epage=2909&aulast=Angelini&aufirst=Lorenza&auinit=L.&aufull=Angelini+L.&coden=JNRYA&isbn=&pages=2897-2909&date=2020&auinit1=L&auinitm=","Embase"

There has been an increase in solutions that are available and we look to identify next generation wearables. Objectives: To identify all validated wearable solutions for PwMS and identify areas of focus for wearable solutions in multiple sclerosis. Methods: We completed a scoping review (using the PRISMAScR guidelines) to summarise the wearable solutions currently available in MS. Our search strategy utilized subject heading searches: 'Multiple Sclerosis' and 'wearable electronic devices', as well as keywords 'wearable technology', and 'electronic devices'. The literature search was conducted using MEDLINE (via PubMed) and Embase (via OVID) databases. This search included articles published from database inception to 30 May 2019. Additional searches looked at frequently published authors with different devices, as well as forward and backward citation tracking of included papers. Results: We identified 35 validated unique solutions that measure gait, cognition, upper limb function, activity, mood and fatigue with most of these solutions being phone applications. Of these, 51% looked at lower limb function with activity levels being looked at by 37% of the total solutions. There was least focus on visual, and mood solutions at 3%, closely followed by quality of life and balance at 5%. Cognition and fatigue accounted for 14% of the total. Conclusions: Looking forward, there is a change occurring from single measure solutions to multi-measure and multi-sensor solutions, such as the Floodlight Open app, which utilises multiple sensors within a smart-phone to remotely measure gait, cognition and upper limb function. Future research should consider costs and include implementation science as part of their research and design to ensure cost of delivery strategy is also accounted for. As development in wearable technology in MS is still on-going, we can expect to see newer wearables focusing on other areas with technology advancements that allow for more upper body and cognitive measures.

Yet fall prevention interventions are not often prescribed until after a fall has been reported to a healthcare provider. While still nascent, objective fall risk assessments could help in prescribing preventative interventions. To this end, retrospective fall status classification commonly serves as an intermediate step in developing prospective fall risk assessments. Previous research has identified measures of gait biomechanics that differ between PwMS who have fallen and those who have not, but these biomechanical indices have not yet been leveraged to detect PwMS who have fallen. Moreover, they require the use of laboratory-based measurement technologies, which prevent clinical deployment. Here we demonstrate that a bidirectional long short-term (BiLSTM) memory deep neural network was able to identify PwMS who have recently fallen with good performance (AUC of 0.88) based on accelerometer data recorded from two wearable sensors during a one-minute walking task. These results provide substantial improvements over machine learning models trained on spatiotemporal gait parameters (21% improvement in AUC), statistical features from the wearable sensor data (16%), and patient-reported (19%) and neurologist-administered (24%) measures in this sample. The success and simplicity (two wearable sensors, only one-minute of walking) of this approach indicates the promise of inexpensive wearable sensors for capturing fall risk in PwMS.","Article in Press","10.1109/JBHI.2020.3025049","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=21682208&id=doi:10.1109%2FJBHI.2020.3025049&atitle=Wearables+and+Deep+Learning+Classify+Fall+Risk+from+Gait+in+Multiple+Sclerosis&stitle=IEEE+J+Biomed+Health+Inform&title=IEEE+journal+of+biomedical+and+health+informatics&volume=PP&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Meyer&aufirst=Brett+M.&auinit=B.M.&aufull=Meyer+B.M.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2020&auinit1=B&auinitm=M","Embase"

Restrictions in societal participation vary between persons, in frequency, meaningfulness, and strain. Assessment of restrictions and changes in societal participation is important to provide timely and individual-specific treatment aiming at meaningful societal participation for PwMS. However most participation questionnaires are not individual-specific and do not measure meaningfulness of societal participation. Aim: To develop a smartphone app to assess real-time individualspecific meaningful societal participation and to assess its feasibility and face validity in PwMS. Methods: Literature was reviewed to define societal participation domains. Discussions were held within the project group and with the app developer for the content and technological aspects of the app. PwMS were recruited to use the so-called 'Whereabouts' app on their smartphone for the duration of seven consecutive days. Feasibility was tested by analysing usability reports of PwMS. Results: Whereabouts is based on actual GPS locations and means of transport, and creates a day-to-day time line of societal activities. At the end of each activity, PwMS are requested to answer 4 questions about meaningfulness and strain of each activity on a 10-point scale. In total 72 PwMS successfully completed the 7-day assessment. Outdoor participation domains ranged from 1.85 [0.09-12.71] median hours per 7 days for work/education to 0.24 [0.00-4.36] for groceries/gardening. The most meaningful participation domains were work/education, providing care for others, health care use, recreation/leisure/sport and social interactions (median 8 [2-10]), and lowest rated meaningful participation domain was carrying out daily routine (median 6 [2-10]).The majority of the participants (60%) reported that the Whereaboutsapp gives a good overview of their societal participation.

To examine relationships between physical fitness, physical activity level, fatigue, depression and disease activity in MS. Methods: Youth with MS (n=19) and HC (n=21) completed a peak exercise test using a cycle ergometer protocol in order to establish cardiorespiratory-fitness (VO2peak), walking endurance was determined by a two-minute walk test, and musculoskeletal strength by grip strength using a hand dynomometer.

Average weekly minutes of physical activity at sedentary, light, moderate and vigorous intensities were determined by Actigraph(R) accelerometer. Tests of differences and correlational analyses were used to evaluate physical fitness. Results: Youth with MS demonstrated a lower average cardiorespiratory fitness of 24.7 ml/kg/min (SD = 4.4 ml/kg/min) compared with 35.2 ml/kg/min (SD = 7.7 ml/kg/min) in age and sex matched controls (T = 4.6, DF 34, P<0.001, Cohen D=1.5).

Although some biomolecules in serum or cerebrospinal fluid have been suggested as biomarkers for MS diagnosis, following disease activity and monitoring treatment response, most of these potential biomarkers are not currently in clinical use and available for all patients. The reasons behind this are generally related to insufficient robustness of biomarker or technical difficulties, high prices, and requirements for technical personnel for their detection. Point-of-care testing (POCT) is an emerging field of healthcare that can be applied at the hospital as well as at home without the need for a centralized laboratory. Biosensor devices offer a convenient means for POCT. A biosensor is a compact analytical device that uses a bioreceptor, such as an antibody, enzyme, or oligonucleotide, to capture the analyte of interest. The interaction between the analyte and the bioreceptor is sensed and transduced into a suitable signal by the signal transducer. The advantages of using a biosensor for detecting the biomolecule of interest include speed, simplicity, accuracy, relatively lower cost, and lack of requirements for highly qualified personnel to perform the testing. Owing to these advantages and with the help of innovations in biosensor development technologies, there has been a great interest in developing biosensor devices for MS in recent years. Hence, the purpose of this review was to provide researchers with an up-to-date summary of the literature as well as to highlight the challenges and opportunities in this translational research field. In addition, because this is a highly interdisciplinary field of study, potentially concerning MS specialists, neurologists, biomedical researchers, and engineers, another aim of this review was to bridge the gap between these disciplines.","Review","10.1016/J.MSARD.2020.102675","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=22110356&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.msard.2020.102675&atitle=A+literature+review+of+biosensors+for+multiple+sclerosis%3A+Towards+personalized+medicine+and+point-of-care+testing&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+Relat.+Disord.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+and+Related+Disorders&volume=48&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Can+Demird%C3%B6%C4%9Fen&aufirst=Birsen&auinit=B.&aufull=Can+Demird%C3%B6%C4%9Fen+B.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2021&auinit1=B&auinitm=","Embase"

Instrumented gait analysis provides a plethora of metrics for quantifying concurrent factors contributing to gait deterioration. However, a gait model discriminating underlying features contributing to this deterioration is lacking in pwMS. This study aimed at developing and validating such a model. Methods: The gait of 24 healthy controls and 114 pwMS with mild, moderate, or severe disability was measured with inertial sensors on the shanks and lower trunk while walking for 6 minutes along a hospital corridor. Twenty out of thirty-six initially explored metrics computed from the sensor data met the quality criteria for exploratory factor analysis. This analysis provided the sought model, which underwent a confirmatory factor analysis before being used to characterize gait impairment across the three disability groups. Results: A gait model consisting of five domains (rhythm/variability, pace, asymmetry, and forward and lateral dynamic balance) was revealed by the factor analysis, which was able to highlight gait abnormalities across the disability groups: significant alterations in rhythm/variability-, asymmetry-, and pace-based features were present in the mild group, but these were more profound in the moderate and severe groups. Deterioration in dynamic balance-based features was only noted in pwMS with a moderate and severe disability. Conclusion: A conceptual model of gait for disease-specific mobility assessment in pwMS was successfully developed and tested. Significance: The new model, built with metrics that represent gait impairment in pwMS, highlighted clinically relevant changes across different disability levels, including those with no clinically observable walking disability.

Objective: This study aimed to determine whether the use of an App, compared to traditional use through e-mail, telephone, or the national website, increased suspected adverse drug reaction (ADR) reporting by persons with multiple sclerosis receiving a first-line disease-modifying drug. Methods: An open multi-centric, cluster-randomized controlled trial was conducted (VigipSEP study).

Persons with multiple sclerosis initiating or switching to a first-line disease-modifying drug between April 2017 and April 2019 were included. The primary outcome was the mean number of ADR reports per patient for the center-level analysis, and the number of ADR reports per patient for the individual-level analysis using the hierarchical Poisson regression model. Results: Twenty-four centers (12 per arm: six public neurologists from the multiple sclerosis academic expert centers, three public neurologists from general hospitals, and three private practice neurologists) were randomized, including 159 patients. The mean number of ADR reports per patient was significantly higher in centers that used the App: 0.47 vs 0.03 in control centers (p = 0.002).

We evaluate the power of the correlation of motor parameters detected by the accelerometer in the Samsung Gear S2 smartwatch with multiple sclerosis (MS) disability measures and patient reported outcomes (PROs). Methods: We enrolled 25 relapsing remitting MS patients. We assessed disability with the expanded disability status scale, two-minute walking test (2MWT), timed 25-foot walk test (T25FWT), and nine-hole peg test. We collected PROs measuring fatigue, ambulatory ability, depression, quality of life, and bladder/bowel function. Participants were asked to wear the accelerometer for a period of 30 days. Results: The Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient showed a moderate negative correlation between the patient-determined disease steps (PDDS) score with the mean steps/day, a strong negative correlation between the PDDS score with the maximum number of daily steps (MNDS) and a moderate negative correlation between the fatigue severity scale score and MNDS.

Methods: Patients with MS were followed prospectively during routine clinic visits approximately every 6 months. At each visit, participants performed finger and foot taps wearing the MYO-band, which includes accelerometer, gyroscope, and surface electromyogram sensors. Metrics of within-patient limb progression were created by combining the change in signal waveform features over time. The resulting upper (UE) and lower (LE) extremity metrics’ discrimination of progressive versus relapsing MS were evaluated with calculation of AUROC. Comparisons with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores were made with Pearson correlation. Results: Participants included 53 relapsing and 15 progressive MS (72% female, baseline mean age 48 years, median disease duration 11 years, median EDSS 2.5, median 10 months follow-up). The final summary metrics differentiated relapsing from secondary progressive MS with AUROC UE 0.93 and LE 0.96. The metrics were associated with baseline EDSS (UE P = 0.0003, LE P = 0.0007). While most had no change in EDSS during the short follow-up, several had evidence of progression by the multisensor metrics. Interpretation: Within a short follow-up interval, this novel multisensor algorithm distinguished progressive from relapsing MS and captured changes in limb function. Inexpensive, noninvasive and easy to use, this novel outcome is readily adaptable to clinical practice and trials as a MS vital sign. This approach also holds promise to monitor limb dysfunction in other neurological diseases.","Article","10.1002/ACN3.51187","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=23289503&id=doi:10.1002%2Facn3.51187&atitle=Biosensor+vital+sign+detects+multiple+sclerosis+progression&stitle=Ann.+Clin.+Transl.+Neurol.&title=Annals+of+Clinical+and+Translational+Neurology&volume=8&issue=1&spage=4&epage=14&aulast=Krysko&aufirst=Kristen+M.&auinit=K.M.&aufull=Krysko+K.M.&coden=&isbn=&pages=4-14&date=2021&auinit1=K&auinitm=M","Embase"

It is also not known how different definitions of a gait bout in daily life monitoring affects the ability to distinguish pathological gait quality. Specifically, how many seconds of a pause with no walking indicates an end to one gait bout and the start of another bout? In this study, we investigated the effect of 3 gait bout definitions on the discriminative ability to distinguish quality of walking in people with multiple sclerosis (MS) from healthy control subjects (HC) during a week of daily living. Methods: 15 subjects with MS and 16 HC wore instrumented socks on each foot and one Opal sensor over the lower lumbar area for a week of daily activities for at least 8 h/day. Three gait bout definitions were based on the length of the pause between the end of one gait bout and start of another bout (1.25 s, 2.50 s, and 5.0 s pause). Area under the curve (AUC) was used to compare gait quality measures in MS versus HC. Results: Total number of gait bouts over the week were statistically significantly different across bout definitions, as expected. However, AUCs of gait quality measures (such as gait speed, stride length, stride time) discriminating people with MS from HC were not different despite the 3 bout definitions. Significance: Quality of gait measures that discriminate MS from HC during daily life are not influenced by the length of a gait bout, despite large differences in quantity of gait across bout definitions. Thus, gait quality measures in people with MS versus controls can be compared across studies using different gait bout definitions with pause lengths ≤5 s.","Article","10.1016/J.GAITPOST.2020.11.024","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=18792219&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.gaitpost.2020.11.024&atitle=Does+gait+bout+definition+influence+the+ability+to+discriminate+gait+quality+between+people+with+and+without+multiple+sclerosis+during+daily+life%3F&stitle=Gait+Posture&title=Gait+and+Posture&volume=84&issue=&spage=108&epage=113&aulast=Shah&aufirst=Vrutangkumar+V.&auinit=V.V.&aufull=Shah+V.V.&coden=GAPOF&isbn=&pages=108-113&date=2021&auinit1=V&auinitm=V","Embase"

The pathologies which can be linked to the presence of GFAP in blood severely affect the human central nervous system. These pathologies are glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), traumatic brain injuries (TBIs), multiple sclerosis (MS), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and neuromyelitis optica (NMO). Here, we develop three different detection strategies for GFAP, among the most popular in the biosensing field and never examined side by side within the experimental frame. We compare their capability of detecting GFAP in a clean-buffer and serum-matrix by using gold-coated quartz-crystal-microbalance (QCM) sensors. All the three detection strategies are based on antibodies, and each of them focuses on a key aspect of the biosensing process. The first is based on a polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain for antifouling, the second on a protein-G linker for controlling antibody-orientation, and the third on antibody-splitting and direct surface immobilization for high-surface coverage. Then, we select the best-performing protocol and validate its detection performance with an ultra-high-frequency (UHF) surface-acoustic-wave (SAW) based lab-on-chip (LoC). GFAP successful detection is demonstrated in a clean-buffer and serum-matrix at a concentration of 35 pM. This GFAP level is compatible with clinical diagnostics.

The development of objective methods of tremor characterisation to assess intervention efficacy and disease progression is therefore important. The possibility of using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) method for tremor detection was explored. Methods Acceleration from a wrist-worn device was analysed using FFTs to identify and characterise tremor magnitude and frequency. Processing parameters were explored to provide insight into the optimal algorithm. Participants wore a wrist tri-axial accelerometer during 9 tasks. The FAHN clinical assessment of tremor was used as the reference standard. Results Five people with MS and tremor (57.6 +/- 15.3 years, 3 F/2M) and ten disease-free controls (42.4 +/- 10.9 years, 5 M/5F) took part. Using specific algorithm settings tremor identification was possible (peak frequency 3-15Hz; magnitude greater than 0.06 g; 2 s windows with 50% overlap; using 2 of 3 axes of acceleration), giving sensitivity 0.974 and specificity 0.971 (38 tremor occurrences out of 108 tasks, 1 false positive, 2 false negatives).

Objective/Hypothesis: This study reports on the rates, patterns of fitness tracker use in adults with MS who are over 60 years of age. We hypothesized that older adults with MS who use fitness trackers “users” would report significantly more physical activity than those who don't “non-users.” Methods: Participants across the United States completed an online survey that included self-reported demographic and clinical characteristics, fitness tracker use questionnaire, and Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ) for measuring total and health-promoting physical activity (GLTEQ-HCS). Results: Of the 440 participants who completed the full survey, 112 (28%) identified as fitness tracker users. The most common activity monitors were Fitbit®, Smartphone app, Apple® watch, and Garmin®. Fitness tracker users mostly reported having relapsing-remitting MS, less disability (i.e., lower Patient Determined Disability Steps), higher income, and higher rates of employment.

A large number of features (n = 156) showed fair-to-strong (R > 0.3) correlations with clinical outcomes. LASSO feature selection was applied to select and rank subsets of features used for dichotomous classification between subject groups, which were compared using Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) models. Classifications of subject types were compared using data obtained from smartphone, smartwatch and the fusion of features from both devices. Models built on smartphone features alone achieved the highest classification performance, indicating that accurate and remote measurement of the ambulatory characteristics of HC and PwMS can be achieved with only one device. It was observed however that smartphone-based performance was affected by inconsistent placement location (running belt versus pocket). Results show that PwMSmod could be distinguished from HC subjects (Acc. 82.2 ± 2.9%, Sen. 80.1 ± 3.9%, Spec. 87.2 ± 4.2%, F1 84.3 ± 3.8), and PwMSmild (Acc. 82.3 ± 1.9%, Sen. 71.6 ± 4.2%, Spec. 87.0 ± 3.2%, F1 75.1 ± 2.2) using an SVM classifier with a Radial Basis Function (RBF). PwMSmild were shown to exhibit HC-like behaviour and were thus less distinguishable from HC (Acc. 66.4 ± 4.5%, Sen. 67.5 ± 5.7%, Spec. 60.3 ± 6.7%, F1 58.6 ± 5.8). Finally, it was observed that subjects in this study demonstrated low intra-and high inter-subject variability which was representative of subject-specific gait characteristics.","Article","10.1109/JBHI.2020.2998187","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=21682208&id=doi:10.1109%2FJBHI.2020.2998187&atitle=Smartphone-and+Smartwatch-Based+Remote+Characterisation+of+Ambulation+in+Multiple+Sclerosis+during+the+Two-Minute+Walk+Test&stitle=IEEE+J.+Biomedical+Health+Informat.&title=IEEE+Journal+of+Biomedical+and+Health+Informatics&volume=25&issue=3&spage=838&epage=849&aulast=Creagh&aufirst=Andrew+P.&auinit=A.P.&aufull=Creagh+A.P.&coden=ITIBF&isbn=&pages=838-849&date=2021&auinit1=A&auinitm=P","Embase"

Patient-collected digital biomarkers may remedy this, if they provide reliable information. However, psychometric properties of digital tools remain largely un-assessed. We developed a smartphone adaptation of the cognitive test, the Symbol-Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) by randomizing the test’s symbol-number codes and testing sequences. The smartphone SDMT showed comparable psychometric properties in 154 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and 39 healthy volunteers (HV). E.g., smartphone SDMT achieved slightly higher correlations with cognitive subscores of neurological examinations and with brain injury measured by MRI (R(2) = 0.75, Rho = 0.83, p < 0.0001) than traditional SDMT. Mathematical adjustment for motoric disability of the dominant hand, measured by another smartphone test, compensates for the disadvantage of touch-based test. Averaging granular home measurements of the digital biomarker also increases accuracy of identifying true neurological decline.","Article","10.1038/S41746-021-00401-Y","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=23986352&id=doi:10.1038%2Fs41746-021-00401-y&atitle=Smartphone-based+symbol-digit+modalities+test+reliably+captures+brain+damage+in+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=npj+Digit.+Med.&title=npj+Digital+Medicine&volume=4&issue=1&spage=&epage=&aulast=Pham&aufirst=Linh&auinit=L.&aufull=Pham+L.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2021&auinit1=L&auinitm=","Embase"

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants were recruited through a standardised invitation letter distributed among 1000 persons randomly selected from the North American Research Committee on MS registry. Those who volunteered wore an accelerometer for 7 d and provided sociodemographic and clinical information. RESULTS: There were 233 persons with MS who were included in the analyses. Linear regression analyses indicated that age and MS type explained significant variance in total sedentary time per day as well as number of breaks in sedentary time. Only disability status explained significant variance in sedentary bout length, whereas age explained significant variance in both number of long sedentary bouts per day. Both age and disability status explained significant variance total time spent in long sedentary bouts per day. CONCLUSIONS: Persons of older age, progressive MS, and higher disability status spend prolonged, uninterrupted periods of time sedentary. Such results highlight the need for targeted interventions in sub-populations of MS that reduce time spent sedentary and break up the pattern of sedentary behaviour. Implications for Rehabilitation Sedentary behaviour is highly prevalent in multiple sclerosis and may be associated with comorbid conditions. The majority of research on sedentary behaviour in multiple sclerosis has been derived from self-report instruments that only measure the volume of sitting time per day. This study indicates that persons with multiple sclerosis spend a significant amount of time sedentary, and those who are older, have progressive multiple sclerosis, and have higher disability status spend prolonged, uninterrupted periods of time sedentary. Such results highlight the need for targeted behavioural interventions in these sub-populations of multiple sclerosis to reduce time spent sedentary and break the pattern of sedentary behaviour to manage its consequences.","Article","10.1080/09638288.2019.1614683","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14645165&id=doi:10.1080%2F09638288.2019.1614683&atitle=Sociodemographic+and+clinical+correlates+of+device-measured+sedentary+behaviour+in+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Disabil+Rehabil&title=Disability+and+rehabilitation&volume=43&issue=1&spage=42&epage=48&aulast=Jeng&aufirst=Brenda&auinit=B.&aufull=Jeng+B.&coden=&isbn=&pages=42-48&date=2021&auinit1=B&auinitm=","Embase"

Balance symmetry and footstep GRFs are critical indicators of overall gait health and elderly fall risks. Prior works, including direct observation by trained medical personnel, computer vision-, pressure sensor-, and wearable-based sensing, are limited due to operational restrictions. We introduce a nonintrusive balance symmetry monitoring approach, which utilizes sparse structural vibration sensing. The intuition is that footstep-induced floor vibration responses are proportional to footstep GRFs, and balance symmetry can be defined using consecutive GRF pairs. However, GRF-vibration relationships are also influenced by spatially-varying structural properties and gait sampling bias, introducing errors to real-world estimations. We address these challenges first by extracting structural regions to overcome spatially-varying vibration behavior and then by developing a kernel-based robust regression model to overcome biased training data and enable robust GRF and balance symmetry modeling. We evaluate our approach through real-world experiments, achieving a balance symmetry index estimation accuracy as high as 96.5%.

Medical disease-modifying treatments have proven effective, especially when introduced early in the disease course. However, patients still experience disease activity and disability progression, and therefore, supplemental early treatment strategies are warranted. Exercise appear to be one of the most promising supplemental treatment strategies, but a somewhat overlooked ' window of opportunity' exist early in the disease course. The objective of this study is to investigate exercise as a supplementary treatment strategy early in the disease course of MS. Methods and analysis The presented Early Multiple Sclerosis Exercise Study is a 48-week (plus 1-year follow-up) national multicentre single-blinded parallel group randomised controlled trial comparing two groups receiving usual care plus supervised high-intense exercise or plus health education (active control). Additionally, data will be compared with a population-based control group receiving usual care only obtained from the Danish MS Registry. The primary outcomes are annual relapse rate and MRI derived global brain atrophy. The secondary outcomes are disability progression, physical and cognitive function, MS-related symptoms, and exploratory MRI outcomes. All analyses will be performed as intention to treat.

These devices are easily accessible and monitor various aspects of motion such as range, velocity and duration over an extended period of time. In contrast, conventional tools for gait analysis and neurological test consume considerable resources hindering their continuous use. In contrast to costly and time consuming gait analyzing tools and neurologic tests, wearables are easy to use in daily practice and are able to detect different aspects of motion like extent, velocity, and duration also over an extended period of time. Additionally, more specific parameters of gait, like stride length, angle of motion, cadence and physiologic as well as disease-specific patterns of motion can be documented more easily. Accelerometer data show good correlation with overall physical activity but also with cardiorespiratory biomarkers of motion as well as MS-related disability, as measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score. Therefore, in the future, wearables will play a major role in the documentation of physical activity, which is one of the most relevant factors for Quality of Life in persons with MS.","Article","10.1055/A-1351-8552","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14394081&id=doi:10.1055%2Fa-1351-8552&atitle=The+Use+of+Wearable+Devices+in+Multiple+Sclerosis&stitle=Klin.+Neurophysiol.&title=Klinische+Neurophysiologie&volume=52&issue=1&spage=39&epage=43&aulast=Monschein&aufirst=Tobias&auinit=T.&aufull=Monschein+T.&coden=KNEUF&isbn=&pages=39-43&date=2021&auinit1=T&auinitm=","Embase"

We have developed a smartphone-based assessment of ambulation performance, the 5 U-Turn Test (5UTT), a quantitative self-administered test of U-turn ability while walking, for people with MS (PwMS). Research question: What is the test-retest reliability and concurrent validity of U-turn speed, an unsupervised self-assessment of gait and balance impairment, measured using a body-worn smartphone during the 5UTT? Methods: 76 PwMS and 25 healthy controls (HCs) participated in a cross-sectional non-randomised interventional feasibility study. The 5UTT was self-administered daily and the median U-turn speed, measured during a 14-day session, was compared against existing validated in-clinic measures of MS-related disability. Results: U-turn speed, measured during a 14-day session from the 5UTT, demonstrated good-to-excellent test-retest reliability in PwMS alone and combined with HCs (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.87 [95 % CI: 0.80–0.92]) and moderate-to-excellent reliability in HCs alone (ICC = 0.88 [95 % CI: 0.69–0.96]). U-turn speed was significantly correlated with in-clinic measures of walking speed, physical fatigue, ambulation impairment, overall MS-related disability and patients’ self-perception of quality of life, at baseline, Week 12 and Week 24. The minimal detectable change of the U-turn speed from the 5UTT was low (19.42 %) in PwMS and indicates a good precision of this measurement tool when compared with conventional in-clinic measures of walking performance. Significance: The frequent self-assessment of turn speed, as an outcome measure from a smartphone-based U-turn test, may represent an ecologically valid digital solution to remotely and reliably monitor gait and balance impairment in a home environment during MS clinical trials and practice.","Article","10.1016/J.GAITPOST.2020.11.025","http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=18792219&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.gaitpost.2020.11.025&atitle=U-turn+speed+is+a+valid+and+reliable+smartphone-based+measure+of+multiple+sclerosis-related+gait+and+balance+impairment&stitle=Gait+Posture&title=Gait+and+Posture&volume=84&issue=&spage=120&epage=126&aulast=Cheng&aufirst=Wei-Yi&auinit=W.-Y.&aufull=Cheng+W.-Y.&coden=GAPOF&isbn=&pages=120-126&date=2021&auinit1=W&auinitm=-Y","Embase"

This study aimed to verify the existence of possible relationships among PA parameters and the spatio-temporal parameters of gait when both are instrumentally assessed.Thirty-one pwMS (17F, 14 M, mean age 52.5, mean Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score 3.1) were requested to wear a tri-axial accelerometer 24 hours/day for 7 consecutive days and underwent an instrumental gait analysis, performed using an inertial sensor located on the low back, immediately before the PA assessment period. Main spatio-temporal parameters of gait (i.e., gait speed, stride length, cadence and duration of stance, swing, and double support phase) were extracted by processing trunk accelerations. PA was quantified using average number of daily steps and percentage of time spent at different PA intensity, the latter calculated using cut-point sets previously validated for MS. The existence of possible relationships between PA and gait parameters was assessed using Spearman rank correlation coefficient rho.Gait speed and stride length were the parameters with the highest number of significant correlations with PA features. In particular, they were found moderately to largely correlated with number of daily steps (rho 0.62, P< .001), percentage of sedentary activity (rho = -0.44, P < .001) and percentage of moderate-to-vigorous activity (rho = 0.48, P < .001). Small to moderate significant correlations were observed between PA intensity and duration of stance, swing and double support phases.The data obtained suggest that the most relevant determinants associated with higher and more intense levels of PA in free-living conditions are gait speed and stride length. The simultaneous quantitative assessment of gait parameters and PA levels might represent a useful support for physical therapists in tailoring optimized rehabilitative and training interventions.","Journal Article","10.1097/MD.0000000000024931",NA,"PubMed"

Materials & methods: This prospective, observational, noninterventional, 3-month follow-up pilot study assessed the evolution of patient-selected goal attainment scale (GAS) item scores and of MS spasticity and associated symptoms during nabiximols treatment. Results: In the full analysis set (n = 21), the mean (SD) overall unweighted GAS score increased from 32.1 (3.4) at baseline to 43.6 (14.6) at month 3 (p = 0.0060), constituting a clinically meaningful change. Slight improvements were observed in MS spasticity and most associated symptoms. Nabiximols improved walking ability and was well tolerated. Conclusion: The study provides proof-of-concept that GAS methodology can be applied to MS management in daily practice. Lay abstract: Many people with multiple sclerosis (MS) have muscle stiffness in their arms and legs that hinders their ability to perform usual daily activities such as walking or using a smartphone. This study followed 21 people with MS to see whether adding nabiximols (Sativex(R)) spray to usual medications for muscle stiffness might help them to achieve goals (e.g., 'less fatigue', 'better walking') which had been selected individually as most important before starting treatment. After 3 months of treatment, the higher average score on the Goal Attainment Scale suggested that, overall, nabiximols can improve MS spasticity-related patient goals although outcomes varied considerably among patients. Patients also perceived improvements in muscle stiffness, other symptoms of MS and walking ability.","Article; Early Access","10.2217/NMT-2020-0060","WOS:000623227700001","WoS"
