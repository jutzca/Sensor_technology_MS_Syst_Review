Materials & methods: This prospective, observational, noninterventional, 3-month follow-up pilot study assessed the evolution of patient-selected goal attainment scale (GAS) item scores and of MS spasticity and associated symptoms during nabiximols treatment. Results: In the full analysis set (n = 21), the mean (SD) overall unweighted GAS score increased from 32.1 (3.4) at baseline to 43.6 (14.6) at month 3 (p = 0.0060), constituting a clinically meaningful change. Slight improvements were observed in MS spasticity and most associated symptoms. Nabiximols improved walking ability and was well tolerated. Conclusion: The study provides proof-of-concept that GAS methodology can be applied to MS management in daily practice. Lay abstract: Many people with multiple sclerosis (MS) have muscle stiffness in their arms and legs that hinders their ability to perform usual daily activities such as walking or using a smartphone. This study followed 21 people with MS to see whether adding nabiximols (Sativex(R)) spray to usual medications for muscle stiffness might help them to achieve goals (e.g., 'less fatigue', 'better walking') which had been selected individually as most important before starting treatment. After 3 months of treatment, the higher average score on the Goal Attainment Scale suggested that, overall, nabiximols can improve MS spasticity-related patient goals although outcomes varied considerably among patients. Patients also perceived improvements in muscle stiffness, other symptoms of MS and walking ability.;"[Paul, Friedemann] Max Delbrueck Ctr Mol Med, Expt & Clin Res Ctr, Berlin, Germany; [Paul, Friedemann] Max Delbrueck Ctr Mol Med, NeuroCure Clin Res Ctr, Berlin, Germany; [Paul, Friedemann] Charite Univ Med Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Silvan, Carlos Vila] Almirall SA, Global Med Affairs, Barcelona, Spain";"Paul, F (corresponding author), Max Delbrueck Ctr Mol Med, Expt & Clin Res Ctr, Berlin, Germany.; Paul, F (corresponding author), Max Delbrueck Ctr Mol Med, NeuroCure Clin Res Ctr, Berlin, Germany.; Paul, F (corresponding author), Charite Univ Med Berlin, Berlin, Germany.";friedemann.paul@charite.de;;;"Almirall S.A.

It is also not known how different definitions of a gait bout in daily life monitoring affects the ability to distinguish pathological gait quality. Specifically, how many seconds of a pause with no walking indicates an end to one gait bout and the start of another bout? In this study, we investigated the effect of 3 gait bout definitions on the discriminative ability to distinguish quality of walking in people with multiple sclerosis (MS) from healthy control subjects (HC) during a week of daily living. Methods: 15 subjects with MS and 16 HC wore instrumented socks on each foot and one Opal sensor over the lower lumbar area for a week of daily activities for at least 8 h/day. Three gait bout definitions were based on the length of the pause between the end of one gait bout and start of another bout (1.25 s, 2.50 s, and 5.0 s pause). Area under the curve (AUC) was used to compare gait quality measures in MS versus HC. Results: Total number of gait bouts over the week were statistically significantly different across bout definitions, as expected. However, AUCs of gait quality measures (such as gait speed, stride length, stride time) discriminating people with MS from HC were not different despite the 3 bout definitions. Significance: Quality of gait measures that discriminate MS from HC during daily life are not influenced by the length of a gait bout, despite large differences in quantity of gait across bout definitions. Thus, gait quality measures in people with MS versus controls can be compared across studies using different gait bout definitions with pause lengths <= 5 s.;"[Shah, Vrutangkumar V.; Harker, Graham; Carlson-Kuhta, Patricia; Spain, Rebecca, I; Mancini, Martina; Horak, Fay B.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Neurol, 3181 Sw Sam Jackson Pk Rd, Portland, OR 97239 USA; [McNames, James] Portland State Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Portland, OR 97207 USA; [McNames, James; El-Gohary, Mahmoud; Horak, Fay B.] APDM Inc, Portland, OR USA; [Curtze, Carolin] Univ Nebraska, Dept Biomech, Omaha, NE 68182 USA; [Spain, Rebecca, I] Vet Affairs Portland Hlth Care Syst, Portland, OR USA";Shah, VV (corresponding author), Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Neurol, 3181 Sw Sam Jackson Pk Rd, Portland, OR 97239 USA.;shahvr@ohsu.edu;;Curtze, Carolin/0000-0001-5394-4628;"National Multiple Sclerosis Society Mentor Fellowship [MB0027]; National Institutes of Health (National Institute on Aging)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA) [R44AG055388]";"We thank our participants for generously donating their time to participate in this study.

Lab-based technology to measure posture is precise but expensive, and clinical tests may not capture underlying impairments. An alternative solution is to leverage smartphone accelerometry as it is affordable, ubiquitous, and portable. Research question: : Can smartphone accelerometry measure postural control compared to a force plate and research grade accelerometer in pwMS, and can smartphone accelerometry discriminate between assisted device and non-assisted device users? Methods: 27 pwMS (12 assisted device users, 15 non-assisted device users) stood on a force plate while holding a smartphone with an attached research grade accelerometer against their chest. Participants performed two, 30 s trials of: eyes open, eyes closed, semi-tandem, tandem, and single leg. Acceleration and center of pressure were extracted, and Root Mean Square (RMS) and 95 % confidence ellipse were calculated. Spearman's correlations were performed, and receiving operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) were calculated. Results: There were moderate to high correlations between the smartphone and accelerometer for RMS (rho = 0.85 - 1.0; p = 0.001 - <0.001) and 95 % area ellipse (rho = 0.92 - 0.99; p = <0.001). There were weak to moderate correlations between the smartphone and force plate for RMS (rho = 0.38 - 0.92; p = 0.06 - <0.001) and 95 % area ellipse (rho = 0.69 - 0.90 p = 0.002 - <0.001). To discriminate between assisted device usage, ROC curves for smartphone outputs were constructed, the AUC was high and statistically significant (p < 0.001 - 0.02). Significance: There is potential to leverage smartphone accelerometery to measure postural control in pwMS. These finding provide preliminary results to support the development of a mobile health application to measure fall risk for pwMS.";"[Hsieh, Katherine L.; Sosnoff, Jacob J.] Univ Illinois, Dept Kinesiol & Community Hlth, 906 S Goodwin Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Hsieh, Katherine L.; Sosnoff, Jacob J.] Univ Illinois, Illinois Multiple Sclerosis Res Collaborat, 901 W Univ Ave,Suite 201, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Hsieh, Katherine L.] Wake Forest Sch Med, Dept Internal Med Geriatr & Gerontol, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA";Hsieh, KL (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Kinesiol & Community Hlth, 906 S Goodwin Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.;klhsieh3@illinois.edu;;;;;;30;0;0;0;0;ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD;CLARE;ELSEVIER HOUSE, BROOKVALE PLAZA, EAST PARK SHANNON, CO, CLARE, 00000, IRELAND;0966-6362;1879-2219;;GAIT POSTURE;Gait Posture;FEB;2021;84;;;;;;114;119;;10.1016/j.gaitpost.2020.11.011;;;6;"Neurosciences; Orthopedics; Sport Sciences";"Neurosciences & Neurology; Orthopedics; Sport Sciences";QL0QW;WOS:000620787200017;33307327;;;;2021-03-18;

We have developed a smartphone-based assessment of ambulation performance, the 5 U-Turn Test (5UTT), a quantitative self-administered test of U-turn ability while walking, for people with MS (PwMS). Research question: What is the test-retest reliability and concurrent validity of U-turn speed, an unsupervised self-assessment of gait and balance impairment, measured using a body-worn smartphone during the 5UTT? Methods: 76 PwMS and 25 healthy controls (HCs) participated in a cross-sectional non-randomised interventional feasibility study. The 5UTT was self-administered daily and the median U-turn speed, measured during a 14-day session, was compared against existing validated in-clinic measures of MS-related disability. Results: U-turn speed, measured during a 14-day session from the 5UTT, demonstrated good-to-excellent testretest reliability in PwMS alone and combined with HCs (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.87 [95 % CI: 0.80-0.92]) and moderate-to-excellent reliability in HCs alone (ICC = 0.88 [95 % CI: 0.69-0.96]). U-turn speed was significantly correlated with in-clinic measures of walking speed, physical fatigue, ambulation impairment, overall MS-related disability and patients' self-perception of quality of life, at baseline, Week 12 and Week 24. The minimal detectable change of the U-turn speed from the 5UTT was low (19.42 %) in PwMS and indicates a good precision of this measurement tool when compared with conventional in-clinic measures of walking performance. Significance: The frequent self-assessment of turn speed, as an outcome measure from a smartphone-based U-turn test, may represent an ecologically valid digital solution to remotely and reliably monitor gait and balance impairment in a home environment during MS clinical trials and practice.;"[Cheng, Wei-Yi; Bourke, Alan K.; Lipsmeier, Florian; Bernasconi, Corrado; Belachew, Shibeshih; Gossens, Christian; Lindemann, Michael] F Hoffmann La Roche Ltd, 124 Grenzacherstr, CH-4070 Basel, Switzerland; [Graves, Jennifer S.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Neurosci, San Diego, CA 92093 USA; [Graves, Jennifer S.] Univ Calif San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Montalban, Xavier] Univ Toronto, Div Neurol, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada; [Montalban, Xavier] Vall dHebron Univ Hosp, Multiple Sclerosis Ctr Catalonia CEMCAT, Dept Neurol Neuroimmunol, Barcelona 08035, Spain; [Lindemann, Michael] Baden Wuerttemberg Cooperat State Univ, Dept Econ, D-79539 Lorrach, Germany; [Belachew, Shibeshih] Biogen, Cambridge, MA USA";Gossens, C (corresponding author), F Hoffmann La Roche Ltd, 124 Grenzacherstr, CH-4070 Basel, Switzerland.;"wei-yi.cheng@roche.com; alan.bourke@roche.com; florian.lipsmeier@roche.com; corrado.bernasconi@roche.com; belachew@me.com; christian.gossens@roche.com; jgraves@ucsd.edu; xavier.montalban@cem-cat.org; michael.lindemann@roche.com";"Belachew, Shibeshih/V-9185-2019; Montalban, Xavier/J-5938-2016";"Belachew, Shibeshih/0000-0003-3976-1950; Montalban, Xavier/0000-0002-0098-9918";"F.

Balance symmetry and footstep GRFs are critical indicators of overall gait health and elderly fall risks. Prior works, including direct observation by trained medical personnel, computer vision-, pressure sensor-, and wearable-based sensing, are limited due to operational restrictions. We introduce a nonintrusive balance symmetry monitoring approach, which utilizes sparse structural vibration sensing. The intuition is that footstep-induced floor vibration responses are proportional to footstep GRFs, and balance symmetry can be defined using consecutive GRF pairs. However, GRF-vibration relationships are also influenced by spatially-varying structural properties and gait sampling bias, introducing errors to real-world estimations. We address these challenges first by extracting structural regions to overcome spatially-varying vibration behavior and then by developing a kernel-based robust regression model to overcome biased training data and enable robust GRF and balance symmetry modeling. We evaluate our approach through real-world experiments, achieving a balance symmetry index estimation accuracy as high as 96.5%.

The pathologies which can be linked to the presence of GFAP in blood severely affect the human central nervous system. These pathologies are glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), traumatic brain injuries (TBIs), multiple sclerosis (MS), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and neuromyelitis optica (NMO). Here, we develop three different detection strategies for GFAP, among the most popular in the biosensing field and never examined side by side within the experimental frame. We compare their capability of detecting GFAP in a clean buffer and serum-matrix by using gold-coated quartz-crystal-microbalance (QCM) sensors. All the three detection strategies are based on antibodies, and each of them focuses on a key aspect of the biosensing process. The first is based on a polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain for antifouling, the second on a protein-G linker for controlling antibody-orientation, and the third on antibody-splitting and direct surface immobilization for high-surface coverage. Then, we select the best-performing protocol and validate its detection performance with an ultrahigh-frequency (UHF) surface-acoustic-wave (SAW) based lab-on-chip (LoC). GFAP successful detection is demonstrated in a clean-buffer and serum-matrix at a concentration of 35 pM. This GFAP level is compatible with clinical diagnostics. This result suggests the use of our technology for the realization of a point-of-care biosensing platform for the detection of multiple brain-pathology biomarkers.;"[Agostini, M.; Amato, F.; Vieri, M.

Objective To investigate the causal effect of PA on MS by Mendelian randomization (MR) approaches. Methods Through a genome-wide association study including 91,105 participants from UK Biobank, we obtained 5 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with accelerometer-measured PA (P < 5 x 10(-8)). Summary-level data for MS were obtained from a meta-analysis, incorporating 14,802 subjects with MS and 26,703 healthy controls of European ancestry. MR analyses were performed using the inverse-variance-weighted method, weighted median estimator, and MR-PRESSO method. Additional analyses were further performed using MR-Egger intercept and Cochran's Q statistic to verify the robustness of our findings. Results We failed to detect a causal effect of PA on MS (OR, 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.30-1.20; P = 0.15) per in the random-effects IVW analysis. Additional MR methods yielded consistent results. MR-Egger regression suggested no evidence of horizontal pleiotropy (Intercept = 0.14, P = 0.21) and there seemed no substantial heterogeneity (I-2 = 29.8%, P = 0.22) among individual SNPs.

There are established methods and models for data collection and interpretation of gait assessment within different pathologies. This narrative review aims to depict the evolution of gait assessment from observation and rating scales to wearable sensors and laboratory technologies and provide limitations and possible future directions in the field of gait assessment. In this context, we first present an extensive review of current clinical outcomes and gait models. Then, we demonstrate commercially available wearable technologies with their technical capabilities along with their use in gait assessment studies for various neurological conditions. In the next sections, a descriptive knowledge for existing inertial and EMG based algorithms and a sign based guide that shows the outcomes of previous neurological gait assessment studies are presented. Finally, we state a discussion for the use of wearables in gait assessment and speculate the possible research directions by revealing the limitations and knowledge gaps in the literature.

The development of objective methods of tremor characterisation to assess intervention efficacy and disease progression is therefore important. The possibility of using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) method for tremor detection was explored. Methods Acceleration from a wrist-worn device was analysed using FFTs to identify and characterise tremor magnitude and frequency. Processing parameters were explored to provide insight into the optimal algorithm. Participants wore a wrist tri-axial accelerometer during 9 tasks. The FAHN clinical assessment of tremor was used as the reference standard. Results Five people with MS and tremor (57.6 +/- 15.3 years, 3 F/2M) and ten disease-free controls (42.4 +/- 10.9 years, 5 M/5F) took part. Using specific algorithm settings tremor identification was possible (peak frequency 3-15Hz; magnitude greater than 0.06 g; 2 s windows with 50% overlap; using 2 of 3 axes of acceleration), giving sensitivity 0.974 and specificity 0.971 (38 tremor occurrences out of 108 tasks, 1 false positive, 2 false negatives). Tremor had frequency 3.5-13.0 Hz and amplitude 0.07-2.60g.

Twenty-one adults with multiple sclerosis, stratified by age and gender, are randomly allocated to either a tailored pacing or control group. Participants wear an accelerometer for seven days that measures physical activity behaviours, and self-report fatigue at the baseline and four-week follow-up. Physical activity behaviours are assessed by examining activity level (seven-day average activity counts per minute) and activity variability (seven-day average highest activity counts each day divided by activity counts on that day). The intervention improves activity levels (Mean difference = 40.91; 95% Confidence Interval [CI] (3.84-77.96); p = 0.03) and lessens activity variability (Mean difference = -0.63; 95% CI (-1.25-0.02); p = 0.04).

It has been demonstrated that suitable job accommodation plans play a beneficial role in the overall quality of life of pathological subjects. A well-designed return-to-work program should consider several recent innovations in the clinical and ergonomic fields. One of the instrument-based methods used to monitor the effectiveness of ergonomic interventions is surface electromyography (sEMG), a multi-channel, non-invasive, wireless, wearable tool, which allows in-depth analysis of motor coordination mechanisms. Although the scientific literature in this field is extensive, its use remains significantly underexploited and the state-of-the-art technology lags expectations. This is mainly attributable to technical and methodological (electrode-skin impedance, noise, electrode location, size, configuration and distance, presence of crosstalk signals, comfort issues, selection of appropriate sensor setup, sEMG amplitude normalization, definition of correct sEMG-related outcomes and normative data) and cultural limitations. The technical and methodological problems are being resolved or minimized also thanks to the possibility of using reference books and tutorials. Cultural limitations are identified in the traditional use of qualitative approaches at the expense of quantitative measurement-based monitoring methods to design and assess ergonomic interventions and train operators. To bridge the gap between the return-to-work rehabilitation and other disciplines, several teaching courses, accompanied by further electrodes and instrumentations development, should be designed at all Bachelor, Master and PhD of Science levels to enhance the best skills available among physiotherapists, occupational health and safety technicians and ergonomists.;"[Ranavolo, Alberto; Draicchio, Francesco] INAIL, Dept Occupat & Environm Med, Epidemiol & Hyg, Rome, Italy; [Serrao, Mariano] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Med & Surg Sci & Biotechnol, Rome, Italy; [Serrao, Mariano] Policlin Italia, Movement Anal LAB, Rome, Italy";Ranavolo, A (corresponding author), INAIL, Dept Occupat & Environm Med, Epidemiol & Hyg, Rome, Italy.;a.ranavolo@inail.it;Serrao, Mariano/K-6972-2016;Serrao, Mariano/0000-0003-3031-680X;European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [871237];The research presented in this article was carried out as part of the SOPHIA project, which has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under Grant Agreement No. 871237.;;96;0;0;3;3;FRONTIERS MEDIA SA;LAUSANNE;AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND;1664-2295;;;FRONT NEUROL;Front.

Fatigue is the most common symptom in MS with a prevalence of 80%. Previous research studied the relation between fatigue and gait impairment using stationary gait analysis systems and short gait tests (e.g. timed 25 ft walk). However, wearable inertial sensors providing gait data from longer and continuous gait bouts have not been used to assess the relation between fatigue and gait parameters in MS. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the association between fatigue and spatio-temporal gait parameters extracted from wearable foot-worn sensors and to predict the degree of fatigue. Methods Forty-nine patients with MS (32 women; 17 men; aged 41.6 years, EDSS 1.0-6.5) were included where each participant was equipped with a small Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) on each foot. Spatio-temporal gait parameters were obtained from the 6-min walking test, and the Borg scale of perceived exertion was used to represent fatigue. Gait parameters were normalized by taking the difference of averaged gait parameters between the beginning and end of the test to eliminate inter-individual differences. Afterwards, normalized parameters were transformed to principle components that were used as input to a Random Forest regression model to formulate the relationship between gait parameters and fatigue. Results Six principal components were used as input to our model explaining more than 90% of variance within our dataset. Random Forest regression was used to predict fatigue. The model was validated using 10-fold cross validation and the mean absolute error was 1.38 points. Principal components consisting mainly of stride time, maximum toe clearance, heel strike angle, and stride length had large contributions (67%) to the predictions made by the Random Forest. Conclusions The level of fatigue can be predicted based on spatio-temporal gait parameters obtained from an IMU based system. The results can help therapists to monitor fatigue before and after treatment and in rehabilitation programs to evaluate their efficacy. Furthermore, this can be used in home monitoring scenarios where therapists can monitor fatigue using IMUs reducing time and effort of patients and therapists.";"[Ibrahim, Alzhraa A.; Kuederle, Arne; Eskofier, Bjoern M.; Kluge, Felix] Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nurnberg FAU, Machine Learning & Data Analyt Lab, Erlangen, Germany; [Ibrahim, Alzhraa A.] Assiut Univ, Fac Comp & Informat, Comp Sci Dept, Asyut, Egypt; [Gassner, Heiko; Klucken, Jochen] Univ Hosp Erlangen, Dept Mol Neurol, Erlangen, Bavaria, Germany; [Klucken, Jochen] Fraunhofer Inst Integrated Circuits, Erlangen, Bavaria, Germany; [Klucken, Jochen] Med Valley Digital Hlth Applicat Ctr, Bamberg, Bavaria, Germany";"Ibrahim, AA (corresponding author), Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nurnberg FAU, Machine Learning & Data Analyt Lab, Erlangen, Germany.; Ibrahim, AA (corresponding author), Assiut Univ, Fac Comp & Informat, Comp Sci Dept, Asyut, Egypt.";Alzhraa.ahmed@fau.de;;Kluge, Felix/0000-0003-4921-6104;"Medical Faculty, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nurnberg; IMI Mobilise-D [820820]; Ministry of High Education, EgyptMinistry of Higher Education & Scientific Research (MHESR); Projekt DEAL";Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.

The purpose of this study was to determine how relationships between trunk and foot acceleration variability relate to physiological impairments, clinical disability scales, and mobility questionnaires in persons with multiple sclerosis. Methods: 15 fallers and 25 non-fallers with multiple sclerosis walked on a treadmill at normal walking speed while trunk and foot accelerations were recorded with wireless accelerometers and variability measures were extracted and used to calculate the gait stability index metrics as a ratio of trunk acceleration variability divided foot acceleration variability. Subjects' sensorimotor delays and lower extremity vibration sensitivity were tested. Subjects also completed clinical disability scales (Guy's Neurological Disability Scale and Patient Reported Expanded Disability Status Scale) and mobility questionnaires (Falls Efficacy Scale, Activities Balance Confidence Scale, 12 Item Multiple Sclerosis Walk Scale). Findings: Multiple gait stability index metrics were significantly correlated with clinical measures of disability and mobility in multiple sclerosis subjects (r = 0.354-0.528), but no correlations were found for sensorimotor delays or lower extremity sensation. Multiple gait stability indices performed at least as well as clinical questionnaires for separating fallers from non-fallers. Interpretation: The gait stability indices can potentially be used outside of a laboratory setting to measure walking characteristics related to fall history and disability level in people with multiple sclerosis.;"[Craig, Jordan J.; Bruetsch, Adam P.] Univ Kansas, Med Ctr, Landon Ctr Aging, 3901 Rainbow Blvd,Mail Stop 1005, Kansas City, KS 66160 USA; [Craig, Jordan J.] Univ Kansas, Bioengn Grad Program, 3135A Learned Hall,1530 W 15th St, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Lynch, Sharon G.] Dept Neurol, 3901 Rainbow Blvd, Kansas City, KS 66160 USA; [Huisinga, Jessie M.] Dept Phys Therapy & Rehabil Sci, 3901 Rainbow Blvd,Mail Stop 2002, Kansas City, KS 66160 USA";Huisinga, JM (corresponding author), Univ Kansas, Med Ctr, 3901 Rainbow Blvd,Mail Stop 1005, Kansas City, KS 66160 USA.;jhuisinga@kumc.edu;;;"National Multiple Sclerosis SocietyNational Multiple Sclerosis Society [RG 4914A1/2]; NIH National Center for Advancing Translational Science [1KL2TR00011]; NIH Ruth L.

Women with MS spent more time in sedentary behavior and exhibited a reduced amount of light intensity activity with respect to men, while MVPA was similar across sexes. However, in comparison with unaffected individuals, the overall PA patterns appear significantly modified mostly in women who, in presence of the disease, present increased sedentary behavior, reduced MVPA, number of daily steps and VM counts.

Methods: Patients with MS were followed prospectively during routine clinic visits approximately every 6 months. At each visit, participants performed finger and foot taps wearing the MYO-band, which includes accelerometer, gyroscope, and surface electromyogram sensors. Metrics of within-patient limb progression were created by combining the change in signal waveform features over time. The resulting upper (UE) and lower (LE) extremity metrics' discrimination of progressive versus relapsing MS were evaluated with calculation of AUROC. Comparisons with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores were made with Pearson correlation. Results: Participants included 53 relapsing and 15 progressive MS (72% female, baseline mean age 48 years, median disease duration 11 years, median EDSS 2.5, median 10 months follow-up). The final summary metrics differentiated relapsing from secondary progressive MS with AUROC UE 0.93 and LE 0.96. The metrics were associated with baseline EDSS (UE P = 0.0003, LE P = 0.0007). While most had no change in EDSS during the short follow-up, several had evidence of progression by the multisensor metrics. Interpretation: Within a short follow-up interval, this novel multisensor algorithm distinguished progressive from relapsing MS and captured changes in limb function. Inexpensive, noninvasive and easy to use, this novel outcome is readily adaptable to clinical practice and trials as a MS vital sign. This approach also holds promise to monitor limb dysfunction in other neurological diseases.;"[Krysko, Kristen M.; Arjona, Jennifer; Waubant, Emmanuelle; Graves, Jennifer S.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Neurol, UCSF Weill Inst Neurosci, San Francisco, CA USA; [Akhbardeh, Alireza] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Radiol & Radiol Sci, Baltimore, MD USA; [Nourbakhsh, Bardia] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Neurol, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Antoine Gourraud, Pierre] Nantes Univ, CHU Nantes, Ctr Rech Transplantat & Immunol, INSERM,ATIP Avenir,UMR 1064, Nantes, France; [Antoine Gourraud, Pierre] CHU Nantes, Pole Hosp Univ Sante Publ 11, Clin Donnees, INSERM,CIC 1413, Nantes, France; [Graves, Jennifer S.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Neurosci, San Diego, CA 92103 USA";Graves, JS (corresponding author), UCSD ACTRI, 9452 Med Ctr Dr,Box 0841, San Diego, CA 92037 USA.;jgraves@health.ucsd.edu;;"Waubant, Emmanuelle/0000-0001-5188-0157; Krysko, Kristen/0000-0003-0090-597X; Graves, Jennifer/0000-0003-1539-1940";"UCSF CTSI pilot grants program; GenentechRoche HoldingGenentech; Sylvia Lawry Physician Fellowship through the National Multiple Sclerosis Society [FP-1605-08753]";To the dedicated patients who participated in this study.

Methods The sample included 30 persons with mild-to-moderate PD (Hoehn and Yahr stages 2-3) and 30 adults without PD matched by sex and age. All participants completed 5 minutes of quiet, seated rest and then underwent three, 6-minute bouts of walking on a treadmill at three different speeds relative to the individual's self-selected pace. Activity counts were measured using an ActiGraph accelerometer worn at the waist level on the least affected side for persons with PD and the dominant side for controls. The rate of oxygen consumption, or energy expenditure, was measured using a portable, open-circuit spirometry system. Results Our results indicated a strong association between activity counts and energy expenditure for persons with PD (R-2 = 0.87) and controls (R-2 = 0.89). However, the significant difference in slopes resulted in a lower cut-point of 1,354 counts center dot min(-1) for persons with PD than the cut-point of 2,010 counts center dot min(-1) for controls. Conclusion Our results support the application of the disease-specific cut-point for quantifying the amount of time spent in MVPA using ActiGraph accelerometers among persons with mild-to-moderate PD. Such an application may provide accurate estimates of MVPA in this population, and better inform future research examining the possible determinants and consequences of physical activity as well as testing of interventions for changing MVPA in PD.;"[Jeng, Brenda; Cederberg, Katie L.

Migraine prevalence is three times higher in the MS clinic population compared to the general population, and patients with MS and migraine are more symptomatic than patients with MS without migraine. Objective: We sought to conduct a pilot feasibility and acceptability study of the RELAXaHEAD app in MS Migraine patients and to assess whether there was any change in migraine disability and MS pain-related disability. Methods: Randomized controlled study of patients with MS-migraine ages 18-80 years with 4+ headache days/ month who were willing to engage in smartphone based behavioral therapy. Half received the RELAXaHEAD app with progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) and the other half received the app without the PMR. Data was collected for 90 days on measures of recruitment, retention, engagement, and adherence to RELAXaHEAD. Preliminary data was also collected on migraine disability (MIDAS) and MS pain (PES). Results: Sixty-two subjects with MS-migraine were enrolled in the study (34 in PMR arm, 28 in monitored usual care arm). On average, during the 90 days, participants played the PMR on average 1.8 times per week, and for 12.9 min on days it was played. Forty-one percent (14/34) of the participants played the PMR two or more times weekly on average. Data was entered into the daily diaries, on average, 49% (44/90) of the days. There were major challenges in reaching subjects in follow-up for the efficacy data, and there was no significant change in migraine disability (MIDAS) scores or MS Pain (PES) scores from baseline to the endpoints. During the six-month follow-up, most patients felt either positively or neutral about the relaxation therapy. Conclusion: There was interest in scalable accessible forms of behavioral therapy to treat migraine and MSrelated pain in patients with MS and comorbid migraine. Similar to prior studies, a significant minority were willing to practice the PMR at least twice weekly. In the societal shift from telephone to more text and internetbased interactions, follow up was challenging, but those reached indicated that they appreciated the PMR and would recommend it to others. Future work should focus on engagement and efficacy.;"[Minen, Mia T.] NYU Langone Hlth, Dept Neurol, 222 E 41st,Ninth Floor, New York, NY 10017 USA; [Schaubhut, Kathryn B.; Morio, Kaitlyn] Columbia Univ, Postbaccalaureate Premed Program, 408 Lewisohn Hall,2970 Broadway, New York, NY 10027 USA";Minen, MT (corresponding author), NYU Langone Hlth, Dept Neurol, 222 E 41st,Ninth Floor, New York, NY 10017 USA.;mia.minen@nyulangone.org;;;"National Multiple Sclerosis SocietyNational Multiple Sclerosis Society; NYU CTSI; Doris Duke Charitable FoundationDoris Duke Charitable Foundation (DDCF); New York University Clinical Translational Science Institute (NYU CTSI); National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) [K23 AT009706-01]";"The authors would like to thank the MS clinicians in the NYU Langone Multiple Sclerosis Center, especially Drs.

Twenty patients with axSpa performed a 10-m walk test in single- and dual-task conditions, three times for each condition. Spatiotemporal, symmetry, and DTE gait parameters were calculated from foot-worn inertial sensors. The relative reliability (intraclass correlation coefficients-ICC) and absolute reliability (standard error of measurement-SEM and minimum detectable change-MDC) were calculated for these parameters in each condition. Spatiotemporal gait parameters showed good to excellent reliability in both conditions (0.59 < ICC < 0.90). The reliability of symmetry and DTE parameters was low. ICC, SEM, and MDC were better when using the mean of the second and the third trials. Spatiotemporal gait parameters obtained from foot-worn inertial sensors assessed in patients with axSpA in single- and dual-task conditions are reliable. However, symmetry and DTE parameters seem less reliable and need to be interpreted with caution. Finally, better reliability of gait parameters was found when using the mean of the 2nd and the 3rd trials.;"[Soulard, Julie; Vaillant, Jacques; Balaguier, Romain; Vuillerme, Nicolas] Univ Grenoble Alpes, AGEIS, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Soulard, Julie] CHU Grenoble Alpes, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Baillet, Athan; Gaudin, Philippe] Univ Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, CHU Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble INP,TIMC IMAG UMR5525, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Vuillerme, Nicolas] Inst Univ France, F-75000 Paris, France; [Vuillerme, Nicolas] Univ Grenoble Alpes, LabCom Telecom4Health, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Vuillerme, Nicolas] Orange Labs, F-38000 Grenoble, France";"Soulard, J (corresponding author), Univ Grenoble Alpes, AGEIS, F-38000 Grenoble, France.; Soulard, J (corresponding author), CHU Grenoble Alpes, F-38000 Grenoble, France.";"jsoulard@chu-grenoble.fr; jacques.vaillant@gmail.com; Romain.balaguier@hotmail.fr; abaillet@chu-grenoble.fr; pgaudin@chu-grenoble.fr; nicolas.vuillerme@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr";"Balaguier, Romain/ABD-8496-2020; VUILLERME, Nicolas/U-5767-2019";"VUILLERME, Nicolas/0000-0003-3773-393X; Balaguier, Romain/0000-0001-6393-1556; Soulard, Julie/0000-0001-8138-1447";"French Ministry of Health and Solidarity; Nursing and Paramedical Hospital Research Program year 2016 [PHRIP-16-0528]; French National Research AgencyFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-10-AIRT-05, ANR-15-IDEX-02]";This study is part of the Ph.D. thesis of the first author Julie Soulard (University Grenoble Alpes, AGEIS, France & Grenoble Alps University Hospital, Grenoble, France).

As most gold standards measure infrequently and require clinician presence, fluctuations in the daily progression are not accounted for. Due to the underlying conditions of homogeneity and stationarity (the main tenets of ergodicity) not being met for the majority of the statistical methods employed in the clinical setting, alternative approaches should be investigated. A solution is to use a non-linear time series analysis approach. Here, Early-Warning Signals (EWS) in the form of critical fluctuations in Keystroke Dynamics (KD), collected using participant's smartphones, are investigated as indicators for a clinical change in three groups. These are patients with MS and changes in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), patients with MS but without changes in MRI, and healthy controls (HCs). Here, we report examples of EWS and changes in KD coinciding with clinically relevant changes in outcome measures in both patients with and without differences in the amount of MRI enhancing lesions. We also report no clinically relevant changes in EWS in the HC population. This study is a first promising step toward using EWS to identify periods of instability as measured by a continuous objective measure as a proxy for outcome measures in the field of MS.;"[Twose, J.; Licitra, G.; McConchie, H.] Neurocast BV, NL-1097 DN Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Lam, K.

Technological advances in biomechanics offer objective assessments of gait disabilities in clinical settings. Here we employed wearable sensors to measure electromyography (EMG) and body acceleration during walking and to quantify the altered gait pattern between people with progressive MS (PwPMS) and healthy controls (HCs). Forty consecutive patients attending our department as in-patients were examined together with fifteen healthy controls. All subjects performed the timed 10 min walking test (T10MW) using a wearable accelerator and 8 electrodes attached to bilateral thighs and legs so that body acceleration and EMG activity were recorded. The T10MWs were recorded under three conditions: standard (wearing shoes), reduced grip (wearing socks) and increased cognitive load (backward-counting dual-task). PwPMS showed worse kinematics of gait and increased muscle coactivation than controls at both the thigh and leg levels. Both reduced grip and increased cognitive load caused a reduction in the cadence and velocity of the T10MW, which were correlated with one another. A higher coactivation index at the thigh level of the more affected side was positively correlated with the time of the T10MW (r = 0.5, p < 0.01), Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) (r = 0.4, p < 0.05), and negatively correlated with the cadence (r = -0.6, p < 0.001). Our results suggest that excessive coactivation at the thigh level is the major determinant of the gait performance as the disease progresses. Moreover, demanding walking conditions do not influence gait in controls but deteriorate walking performances in PwPMS, thus those conditions should be prevented during hospital examinations as well as in homecare environments.;"[Huang, Su-Chun; Dalla Costa, Gloria; Pisa, Marco; Congiu, Martina; Comi, Giancarlo; Leocani, Letizia] Osped San Raffaele, INSPE Inst Expt Neurol, Neurorehabil Dept, I-20132 Milan, Italy; [Huang, Su-Chun; Dalla Costa, Gloria; Pisa, Marco; Congiu, Martina; Comi, Giancarlo; Leocani, Letizia] Osped San Raffaele, INSPE Inst Expt Neurol, Expt Neurophysiol Unit, I-20132 Milan, Italy; [Dalla Costa, Gloria; Pisa, Marco; Gregoris, Lorenzo; Leccabue, Giulia; Comi, Giancarlo; Leocani, Letizia] Univ Vita Salute San Raffaele, Via Olgettina 58, I-20132 Milan, Italy";"Leocani, L (corresponding author), Osped San Raffaele, INSPE Inst Expt Neurol, Neurorehabil Dept, I-20132 Milan, Italy.; Leocani, L (corresponding author), Osped San Raffaele, INSPE Inst Expt Neurol, Expt Neurophysiol Unit, I-20132 Milan, Italy.; Leocani, L (corresponding author), Univ Vita Salute San Raffaele, Via Olgettina 58, I-20132 Milan, Italy.";"huang.suchun@hsr.it; dallacosta.gloria@hsr.it; pisa.marco@hsr.it; gregorislorenzo96@gmail.com; giulialeccabue95@gmail.com; congiu.martina@hsr.it; comi.giancarlo@hsr.it; letizia.leocani@hsr.it";"Leocani, Letizia/ABH-4703-2020; Dalla Costa, Gloria/F-6440-2017";"Dalla Costa, Gloria/0000-0002-8761-9337; Pisa, Marco/0000-0001-9409-6864; Huang, Su-Chun/0000-0002-7359-6736";"senior research fellowship FISM-Fodazione Italiana Sclerosi Multipla [2018/B/4]; 5 per mille public funding";This research received no external funding, while S.C.H. is supported by a senior research fellowship FISM-Fodazione Italiana Sclerosi Multipla-cod. 2018/B/4, and FISM is financed or co-financed with the `'5 per millepublic funding.;;29;1;1;0;0;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;1424-8220;;SENSORS-BASEL;Sensors;NOV;2020;20;21;;;;;;;6160;10.3390/s20216160;;;11;"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation";"Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation";OR2BW;WOS:000589281000001;33138057;DOAJ Gold, Green Published;;;2021-03-18;

For example, an increase of the concentration of circulating miR-17 has been linked to lung cancer and metastatic breast cancer, while its decrease has been found in multiple sclerosis and gastric cancer. Consequently, techniques for the fast, specific and simple quantitation of microRNAs are becoming crucial enablers of early diagnosis and therapeutic follow-up. DNA based biosensors can serve this purpose, overcoming some of the drawbacks of conventional lab-based techniques. Herein, we report a costeffective, simple and robust biosensor based on localized surface plasmon resonance and hybridization chain reaction. Immobilized gold nanoparticles are used for the detection of miR-17. Specificity of the detection was achieved by the use of hairpin surface-tethered probes and the hybridization chain reaction was used to amplify the detection signal and thus extend the dynamic range of the quantitation. Less than 1 h is needed for the entire procedure that achieved a limit of detection of about 1 pM or 50 amol/measurement, well within the reported useful range for diagnostic applications. We suggest that this technology could be a promising substitute of traditional lab-based techniques for the detection and quantification of miRNAs after these are extracted from diagnostic specimens and their analysis is thus made possible.;"[Miti, Andrea; Zuccheri, Giampaolo] Univ Bologna, Dept Pharm & Biotechnol, Via San Giacomo 11, Bologna, Italy; [Miti, Andrea; Zuccheri, Giampaolo] Univ Bologna, Interdept Ctr Ind Res Life & Hlth Sci, Via San Giacomo 11, Bologna, Italy; [Zuccheri, Giampaolo] Inst Nanosci Italian CNR, S3 Ctr, Pisa, Italy; [Thamm, Sophie; Mueller, Philipp; Csaki, Andrea; Fritzsche, Wolfgang] Leibniz Inst Photon Technol, Albert Einstein Str 9, D-07745 Jena, Germany";"Zuccheri, G (corresponding author), Univ Bologna, Dept Pharm & Biotechnol, Via San Giacomo 11, Bologna, Italy.; Zuccheri, G (corresponding author), Univ Bologna, Interdept Ctr Ind Res Life & Hlth Sci, Via San Giacomo 11, Bologna, Italy.; Fritzsche, W (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Photon Technol, Albert Einstein Str 9, D-07745 Jena, Germany.";giampaolo.zuccheri@unibo.it;"; Zuccheri, Giampaolo/I-7378-2012";"Csaki, Andrea/0000-0002-2414-4100; Miti, Andrea/0000-0002-2730-1861; Zuccheri, Giampaolo/0000-0003-4777-5391";DFGGerman Research Foundation (DFG)European Commission [FKZ: FR 1348/31-1, FKZ: 02WIL1521];We thankfully acknowledge Desiree Braun for assistance in the preparation of the sensor chips.

Current monitoring practices predominantly rely on brief and infrequent assessments, which may not be representative of the real-world patient experience. Smartphone technology provides an opportunity to assess people's daily-lived experience of MS on a frequent, regular basis outside of episodic clinical evaluations. Objective: The objectives of this study were to evaluate the feasibility and utility of capturing real-world MS-related health data remotely using a smartphone app, elevateMS, to investigate the associations between self-reported MS severity and sensor-based active functional tests measurements, and the impact of local weather conditions on disease burden. Methods: This was a 12-week, observational, digital health study involving 3 cohorts: self-referred participants who reported an MS diagnosis, clinic-referred participants with neurologist-confirmed MS, and participants without MS (controls). Participants downloaded the elevateMS app and completed baseline assessments, including self-reported physical ability (Patient-Determined Disease Steps [PDDS]), as well as longitudinal assessments of quality of life (Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders [Neuro-QoL] Cognitive, Upper Extremity, and Lower Extremity Function) and daily health (MS symptoms, triggers, health, mobility, pain). Participants also completed functional tests (finger-tapping, walk and balance, voice-based Digit Symbol Substitution Test [DSST], and finger-to-nose) as an independent assessment of MS-related cognition and motor activity. Local weather data were collected each time participants completed an active task. Associations between self-reported baseline/longitudinal assessments, functional tests, and weather were evaluated using linear (for cross-sectional data) and mixed-effects (for longitudinal data) regression models. Results: A total of 660 individuals enrolled in the study; 31 withdrew, 495 had MS (n=359 self-referred, n=136 clinic-referred), and 134 were controls. Participation was highest in clinic-referred versus self-referred participants (median retention: 25.5 vs 7.0 days). The top 5 most common MS symptoms, reported at least once by participants with MS, were fatigue (310/495, 62.6%), weakness (222/495, 44.8%), memory/attention issues (209/495, 42.2%), and difficulty walking (205/495, 41.4%), and the most common triggers were high ambient temperature (259/495, 52.3%), stress (250/495, 50.5%), and late bedtime (221/495, 44.6%). Baseline PDDS was significantly associated with functional test performance in participants with MS (mixed model-based estimate of most significant feature across functional tests [beta]: finger-tapping: beta=-43.64, P<.001; DS ST: beta=-5.47, P=.005; walk and balance: beta=-.39, P=.001; finger-to-nose: beta=.01, P=.01). Longitudinal Neuro-QoL scores were also significantly associated with functional tests (finger-tapping with Upper Extremity Function: beta=.40, P<.001; walk and balance with Lower Extremity Function: beta=-99.18, P=.02; DSST with Cognitive Function: beta=1.60, P=.03). Finally, local temperature was significantly associated with participants' test performance (finger-tapping: beta-.14, P<.001; DSST: beta-.06, P=.009; finger-to-nose: beta=-53.88, P<.001). Conclusions: The elevateMS study app captured the real-world experience of MS, characterized some MS symptoms, and assessed the impact of environmental factors on symptom severity. Our study provides further evidence that supports smartphone app use to monitor MS with both active assessments and patient-reported measures of disease burden. App based tracking may provide unique and timely real-world data for clinicians and patients, resulting in improved disease insights and management.";"[Pratap, Abhishek; Tummalacherla, Meghasyam; Mangravite, Lara; Omberg, Larsson] Sage Bionetworks, 2901 Third Ave,Suite 330, Seattle, WA 98121 USA; [Grant, Daniel; Vegesna, Ashok; Deshpande, Chinmay] Novartis Pharmaceut, E Hanover, NJ USA; [Cohan, Stanley] Providence St Vincent Med Ctr, Providence Multiple Sclerosis Ctr, Portland, OR USA";Omberg, L (corresponding author), Sage Bionetworks, 2901 Third Ave,Suite 330, Seattle, WA 98121 USA.;larsson.omberg@sagebionetworks.org;;"Pratap, Abhishek/0000-0002-5289-6932; Tummalacherla, Meghasyam/0000-0002-0741-8683; Omberg, Larsson/0000-0002-4719-9120; Shah, Roshani/0000-0002-5695-5717";Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East Hanover, NJ, USA;The authors thank all MS patient advisors for their time and feedback during the design of the elevateMS app, as well as the clinicians and staff of the clinical sites that helped recruit participants to the elevateMS study.

It is important to detect even slightest walking impairments in order to start and optimize necessary interventions in time to counteract further progression of the disability. For this reason, a regular monitoring through gait analysis is highly necessary. At advanced stages of MS with significant walking impairment, this assessment is also necessary to optimize symptomatic treatment, choose the most suitable walking aid and plan individualized rehabilitation. In clinical practice, walking impairment is only assessed at higher levels of the disease using e.g., the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). In contrast to the EDSS, standardized functional tests such as walking speed, walking endurance and balance as well as walking quality and gait-related patient-reported outcomes allow a more holistic and sensitive assessment of walking impairment. In recent years, the MS Center Dresden has established a standardized monitoring procedure for the routine multidimensional assessment of gait and balance disorders. In the following protocol, we present the techniques and procedures for the analysis of gait and balance of people with MS at the MS Center Dresden. Patients are assessed with a multidimensional gait analysis at least once a year. This enables long-term monitoring of walking impairment, which allows early active intervention regarding further progression of disease and improves the current standard clinical practice.;"[Trentzsch, Katrin; Weidemann, Marie Luise; Torp, Charlotte; Inojosa, Hernan; Scholz, Maria; Haase, Rocco; Schriefer, Dirk; Akgun, Katja; Ziemssen, Tjalf] Tech Univ Dresden, Univ Hosp Carl Gustav Carus, Ctr Clin Neurosci, Dept Neurol,MS Ctr Dresden,Neurol Clin, Dresden, Germany";Ziemssen, T (corresponding author), Tech Univ Dresden, Univ Hosp Carl Gustav Carus, Ctr Clin Neurosci, Dept Neurol,MS Ctr Dresden,Neurol Clin, Dresden, Germany.;Tjalf.Ziemssen@uniklinikum-dresden.de;;Haase, Rocco/0000-0003-2465-4909;;;;110;0;0;3;3;FRONTIERS MEDIA SA;LAUSANNE;AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND;;1662-453X;;FRONT NEUROSCI-SWITZ;Front.

Methods: MS participants were recruited for a double-blind, parallel-arm, randomized, sham-controlled trial and assigned to 10 sessions (5 d/wk for 2 weeks) of either active or sham tDCS paired with unloaded cycling for 20 minutes. Stimulation was administered over the left M1 cortex (2.5 mA; anode over C3/cathode over FP2). Gait spatiotemporal parameters were assessed using a wearable inertial sensor (10-meter and 2-minute walking tests). Measurements were collected at baseline, end of tDCS intervention, and 4-week postintervention to test for duration of any benefits. Results: A total of 15 participants completed the study, nine in the active and six in the sham condition. The active and sham groups were matched according to gender (50% vs. 40% female), neurologic disability (median EDSS 5.5 vs. 5), and age (mean 52.1 +/- 12.9 vs. 53.7 +/- 9.8 years).

Methods We developed a smartphone application called MS Screen Test (MSST) to explore several dimensions of the neurological exam such as finger tapping speed, agility, hand synchronization, low contrast vision and cognition during a short evaluation. This app was tested on a cohort of healthy volunteers including a subset of subjects who underwent two evaluations on the same day to assess reproducibility. In a second step, the app was tested on a cohort of RIS subjects. Performances of RIS subjects were compared with age and genre-matched HC. Results HC underwent two consecutive evaluations on MSST. The analysis showed good reproducibility for all measures. Then 21 RIS subjects were compared to 32 matched HC. Compared to HC, we found that RIS subjects had a lower finger tapping speed on the dominant hand (5.6 versus 6.5 taps per second;p = 0.005), a longer inter hand interval during the hand synchronization task (14.4 versus 11.3 ms;p = 0.03) and significantly poorer scores on the low contrast vision and cognition tests. Conclusion MSST only requires a smartphone to obtain digital biomarkers relative to several dimensions of the neurological examination. Our results highlighted subtle differences between HC and RIS subjects. We plan to evaluate this tool in MS patients, which will allow us to get a much larger sample of subjects, to determine whether digital biomarkers can predict disease course.";"[Cohen, Mikael; Fakir, Salim; Landes, Cassandre; Lebrun, Christine] Ctr Hosp Univ Pasteur 2, Unite Rech Clin Cote DAzur URRIS UR2CA, CRC SEP, Serv Neurol, 30 Voie Romaine, F-06002 Nice, France; [Mondot, Lydiane] Ctr Hosp Univ Pasteur 2, Unite Rech Clin Cote DAzur URRIS UR2CA, Serv Radiol, 30 Voie Romaine, F-06002 Nice, France";Cohen, M (corresponding author), Ctr Hosp Univ Pasteur 2, Unite Rech Clin Cote DAzur URRIS UR2CA, CRC SEP, Serv Neurol, 30 Voie Romaine, F-06002 Nice, France.;cohen.m@chu-nice.fr;;Cohen, Mikael/0000-0002-3985-1297;;;;21;0;0;0;0;SPRINGER HEIDELBERG;HEIDELBERG;TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY;0340-5354;1432-1459;;J NEUROL;J.

The Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) is widely used to formally quantify CPS. We implemented a variant of the SDMT in MS sherpa, a smartphone app for persons with MS. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the construct validity and test-retest reliability of the MS sherpa smartphone variant of the SDMT (sSDMT). Methods: We performed a validation study with 25 persons with relapsing-remitting MS and 79 healthy control (HC) subjects. In the HC group, 21 subjects were matched to the persons with MS with regard to age, gender, and education and they followed the same assessment schedule as the persons with MS (the HC matched group) and 58 subjects had a less intense assessment schedule to determine reference values (the HC normative group). Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were determined between the paper-and-pencil SDMT and its smartphone variant (sSDMT) on 2 occasions, 4 weeks apart. Other ICCs were determined for test-retest reliability, which were derived from 10 smartphone tests per study participant, with 3 days in between each test. Seven study participants with MS were interviewed regarding their experiences with the sSDMT. Results: The SDMT scores were on average 12.06% higher than the sSDMT scores, with a standard deviation of 10.68%. An ICC of 0.838 was found for the construct validity of the sSDMT in the combined analysis of persons with MS and HC subjects. Average ICCs for test-retest reliability of the sSDMT for persons with MS, the HC matched group, and the HC normative group were 0.874, 0.857, and 0.867, respectively. The practice effect was significant between the first and the second test of the persons with MS and the HC matched group and trivial for all other test-retests. The interviewed study participants expressed a positive attitude toward the sSDMT, but they also discussed the importance of adapting a smartphone cognition test in accordance with the needs of the individual persons with MS. Conclusions: The high correlation between sSDMT and the conventional SDMT scores indicates a very good construct validity. Similarly, high correlations underpin a very good test-retest reliability of the sSDMT. We conclude that the sSDMT has the potential to be used as a tool to monitor CPS in persons with MS, both in clinical studies and in clinical practice.;"[van Oirschot, Pim; den Teuling, Bram] Orikami Digital Hlth Prod, Ridderstr 29, NL-6511 TM Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Heerings, Marco] Dutch Natl MS Fdn, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Heerings, Marco] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Med Ctr, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Wendrich, Karine] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Fac Sci, Inst Sci Soc, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Martens, Marijn B.] Drug Target ID, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Martens, Marijn B.] NeuroDrug Res BV, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Jongen, Peter J.] Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Community & Occupat Med, Groningen, Netherlands; [Jongen, Peter J.] MS4 Res Inst, Nijmegen, Netherlands";van Oirschot, P (corresponding author), Orikami Digital Hlth Prod, Ridderstr 29, NL-6511 TM Nijmegen, Netherlands.;pim@mssherpa.nl;;"Jongen, Peter/0000-0002-9202-6309; den Teuling, Bram/0000-0001-9084-5645";"European Regional Development Fund (EFRO OP Oost Project) [00217]; NMSF, Rotterdam, the NetherlandsNetherlands Government";The study received financial support from the European Regional Development Fund (EFRO OP Oost Project 00217) and the NMSF, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.

The purpose of this study is to determine the test-retest reliability, standard error of measurement (SEM) and minimum detectable change (MDC) of features calculated on gait characteristics, harvested during a self-administered 2MWT in a home environment, in 51 PwMS and 11 healthy control (HC) subjects over 24 weeks, using a single waist-worn inertial sensor-based smartphone. Excellent, or good to excellent test-retest reliability were observed in 58 of the 92 temporal, spatial and spatiotemporal gait features in PwMS. However, these were less reliable for HCs. Low SEM% and MDC% values were observed for most of the distribution measures for all gait characteristics for PwMS and HCs. This study demonstrates the inter-session test-retest reliability and provides an indication of clinically important change estimates, for interpreting the outcomes of gait characteristics measured using a body-worn smartphone, during a self-administered 2MWT. This system thus provides a reliable measure of gait characteristics in PwMS, supporting its application for the longitudinal assessment of gait deficits in this population.;"[Bourke, Alan K.; Lipsmeier, Florian; Gossens, Christian; Lindemann, Michael] F Hoffmann La Roche Ltd, Roche Innovat Ctr Basel, pRED Informat, Roche Pharma Res & Early Dev, Grenzacherstr 124, CH-4070 Basel, Switzerland; [Scotland, Alf] Inovigate, Aeschenvorstadt 55, CH-4051 Basel, Switzerland";Gossens, C (corresponding author), F Hoffmann La Roche Ltd, Roche Innovat Ctr Basel, pRED Informat, Roche Pharma Res & Early Dev, Grenzacherstr 124, CH-4070 Basel, Switzerland.;"alan.bourke@roche.com; alf.scotland@inovigate.com; florian.lipsmeier@roche.com; christian.gossens@roche.com; michael.lindemann@roche.com";;"Scotland, Alf/0000-0001-9590-8617; Bourke, Alan/0000-0002-7111-422X";F Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., Basel, SwitzerlandHoffmann-La Roche;This research was funded by F Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., Basel, Switzerland.;;42;1;1;0;0;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;1424-8220;;SENSORS-BASEL;Sensors;OCT;2020;20;20;;;;;;;5906;10.3390/s20205906;;;17;"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation";"Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation";ON9VP;WOS:000587039000001;33086734;DOAJ Gold, Green Published;;;2021-03-18;

This project examined the utility of a head-worn inertial measurement unit (IMU) to quantify head movement frequency, velocity, and amplitude during gaze stability exercises. Methods: Twenty-eight individuals with multiple sclerosis and complaints of dizziness or a history of falls were randomly assigned to either a strength and aerobic exercise (SAE) or gaze and postural stability (GPS) group. During a 6-week intervention, participants wore a head-mounted IMU 3 times (early, middle, and late). For aim 1, the frequency, mean peak velocity, and mean peak amplitude of head turns during equivalent duration components of group-specific exercises were compared using general linear models. For aim 2, the progression of treatment in the GPS group was examined using general linear regression models for each outcome. Results: Aim 1 revealed the GPS group demonstrated significantly greater velocity and amplitude head turns during treatment than the SAE group. The frequency of head turns did not significantly differ between the 2 groups. The aim 2 analyses demonstrated that the yaw and pitch frequency of head turns significantly increased during gaze stability exercises over the 6-week intervention. Velocity and amplitude of head turns during yaw and pitch gaze stability exercises did not significantly change. Discussion and Conclusions: A head-worn IMU during rehabilitation distinguished between groups. Furthermore, within the GPS group, the IMU quantified the progression of the frequency of head movements during gaze stability exercises over time.

Methods: Twenty-four individuals with CP (4-14 years) and 24 gender- and age-matched controls were evaluated with a new test based on IMU technology to identify and measure any movement in the three spatial planes while the individual is seated watching a two-minute video. An ellipse was obtained encompassing 95% of the flexion/extension and rotation movements in the sagittal and transversal planes. The protocol was repeated on two occasions separated by 3 to 5 days. Construct and concurrent validity were assessed by determining the discriminant capacity of the new test and by identifying associations between functional measures and the new test outcomes. Relative reliability was determined using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for test-retest data. Absolute reliability was obtained by the standard error of measurement (SEM) and the Minimum Detectable Change at a 90% confidence level (MDC90). Results: The discriminant capacity of the area and both dimensions of the new test was high (Area Under the Curve approximate to 0.8), and consistent multiple regression models were identified to explain functional measures with new test results and sociodemographic data. A consistent trend of ICCs higher than 0.8 was identified for CP individuals. Finally, the SEM can be considered low in both groups, although the high variability among individuals determined some high MDC90 values, mainly in the CP group. Conclusions: The new test, based on IMU data, is valid and reliable for evaluating posture and motor control in children with CP.;"[Carmona-Perez, Cristina] Ctr Recuperac Neurol Cordoba CEDANE, Cordoba 14005, Spain; [Carmona-Perez, Cristina; Alcaraz-Clariana, Sandra; Garcia-Luque, Lourdes] Univ Cordoba, Doctoral Program Biomed, Cordoba 14004, Spain; [Perez-Ruiz, Alberto; Alcaraz-Clariana, Sandra; Rodrigues-de-Souza, Daiana Priscila; Alburquerque-Sendin, Francisco] Univ Cordoba, Fac Med & Nursing, Dept Nursing Pharmacol & Phys Therapy, Cordoba 14004, Spain; [Garrido-Castro, Juan L.; Vidal, Francisco Torres] Univ Cordoba, Dept Comp Sci & Numer Anal, Rabanales Campus, Cordoba 14071, Spain; [Garrido-Castro, Juan L.; Alburquerque-Sendin, Francisco] Maimonides Biomed Res Inst Cordoba IMIBIC, Cordoba 14004, Spain";Rodrigues-de-Souza, DP (corresponding author), Univ Cordoba, Fac Med & Nursing, Dept Nursing Pharmacol & Phys Therapy, Cordoba 14004, Spain.;"mcarperes@yahoo.es; n62perua@uco.es; cc0juanl@uco.es; frantorresvidal@gmail.com; m72alcls@uco.es; lgarcial05@hotmail.com; drodrigues@uco.es; falburquerque@uco.es";Alburquerque-Sendin, Francisco/L-1539-2016;"Alburquerque-Sendin, Francisco/0000-0002-3892-8440; Garcia-Luque, Lourdes/0000-0002-1735-5946; Garrido-Castro, Juan L./0000-0002-0871-3780; Rodrigues-de-Souza, Daiana Priscila/0000-0002-3651-3276; ALCARAZ, SANDRA/0000-0002-4138-9142";"Consejeria de Salud (Andalusian Government, Spain) [PI-0324-2017, PIN-0079-2016]; Instituto de Salud Carlos IIIInstituto de Salud Carlos IIIEuropean Commission [DTS18/00046]";"This research was funded by Consejeria de Salud (Andalusian Government, Spain), grants PI-0324-2017 and PIN-0079-2016, and Instituto de Salud Carlos III grant DTS18/00046.

However, gait data collected in non-controlled settings are often fragmented and may not provide enough information for reliable measures. This paper evaluates a novel approach to (1) determine the effects of the length of the walking task on the reliability of calculated measures and (2) identify digital biomarkers for gait assessments from fragmented data. Thirty-seven participants (37) diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS (EDSS range 0 to 4.5) executed two trials, walking 20 m each, with inertial sensors attached to their right and left shanks. Gait events were identified from the medio-lateral angular velocity, and short bouts of gait data were extracted from each trial, with lengths varying from 3 to 9 gait cycles. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) evaluate the degree of agreement between the two trials of each participant, according to the number of gait cycles included in the analysis. Results show that short bouts of gait data, including at least six gait cycles of bilateral data, can provide reliable gait measurements for persons with MS, opening new perspectives for gait assessment using fragmented data (e.g., wearable devices, community assessments).

This study aimed at gathering preliminary wrist-based PA adherence data in free-living and relate these to the influencing factors. Methods: Ten healthy older adults (4 females, aged 70-78 years) provided health, fatigue, activity levels, attitude towards pacing, and self-efficacy information and performed a 6 min-walk test to assess their fitness. After a baseline week they followed a two-week walking and exercise intervention. Participants saw their progress via a purposely designed mobile application. Results: Walking and exercise adherence did not increase during the intervention (p= 0.38,p= 0.65). Self-efficacy decreased (p= 0.024). The baseline physical component of the Short Form Health Survey was the most predictive variable of walking adherence. Baseline perceived risk of over-activity and resting heart rate (HRrest) were the most predictive variables of exercise adherence. When the latter two were used to cluster participants according to their exercise adherence, the fitness gap between exercise-adherent and non-adherent increased after the intervention (p= 0.004). Conclusions: Risk of over-activity and HR(rest)profiled short-term exercise adherence in older adults.

However, one overarching limitation of this research is that researchers have not recruited samples who have the actual problem of being studied (i.e., cognitive processing speed impairment). This study examined associations between device-measured PA and cognitive processing speed in a large sample of persons with MS overall and between those with and without cognitive processing speed impairment. Method: Three hundred eighty-five persons with MS underwent the oral Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) and wore an accelerometer for 7 days for PA measurement. We divided the overall sample into subsamples with (n= 140) and without (n= 245) cognitive processing speed impairment based on age, sex, and education-adjusted SDMTZ-scores. Results: After controlling for age and disability status, higher levels of device-measured PA were significantly associated with faster cognitive processing speed overall, and the association was significantly stronger among persons with MS who presented with cognitive processing speed impairment. Conclusions: This examination provides initial cross-sectional support for informing the development of PA interventions as a possible approach for managing MS-related cognitive processing speed impairment. This highlights the importance of developing purposefully designed trials involving PA interventions for targeting cognitive processing speed as a primary end point among persons with MS with impaired cognitive processing speed.;"[Sandroff, Brian M.; Motl, Robert W.] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Phys Therapy, SHP 389,1720 2nd Ave S, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA";Sandroff, BM (corresponding author), Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Phys Therapy, SHP 389,1720 2nd Ave S, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA.;sandroff@uab.edu;;Sandroff, Brian/0000-0002-2013-7632;"National Multiple Sclerosis SocietyNational Multiple Sclerosis Society; OSF Foundation";This study was funded, in part, by grants from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society and OSF Foundation.;;43;0;0;1;2;CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS;NEW YORK;32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA;1355-6177;1469-7661;;J INT NEUROPSYCH SOC;J.

Identifying potential fallers and giving them proper attention could reduce their chance of a fall that results in severe injuries and decreased quality of life. In this study, we introduced a novel approach for fall risk prediction that evaluates Short-form Berg Balance Scale scores via inertial measurement unit data measured from a 3-meter timed-up-and-go test. This approach used sensor technology and was thus easy to implement, and allowed a quantitative analysis of both gait and balance. The results showed that elastic net logistic regression achieved the best performance with 85% accuracy and 88% area under the curve compared with support vector machine, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and stepwise logistic regression. This paper provides a framework for using sensor-based features together with a feature-selection strategy for screening and predicting the fall risk of post-stroke patients in a convenient setup with high accuracy. The findings of this study will not only enable the assessment of fall risk among post-stroke patients in a cost-effective manner but also provide decision-making support for community care providers and medical professionals in the form of sensor-based data on gait performance.;"[Hsu, Yu-Cheng; Zhao, Yang; Tsui, Kwok-Leung] City Univ Hong Kong, Sch Data Sci, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Huang, Kuang-Hui; Wu, Ya-Ting] Minist Hlth & Welf, Tao Yuan Gen Hosp, Taoyuan 33004, Taiwan; [Cabrera, Javier] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Stat, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; [Sun, Tien-Lung] Yuan Ze Univ, Dept Ind Engn & Management, Taoyuan 32003, Taiwan";Zhao, Y (corresponding author), City Univ Hong Kong, Sch Data Sci, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;yangzhao9-c@my.cityu.edu.hk;;"Sun, Tien-Lung/0000-0002-8408-404X; Zhao, Yang/0000-0003-1571-5394; HSU, Yu Cheng/0000-0002-3722-664X";"RGC Theme-Based Research Scheme [T32-102/14-N]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71901188]; CityU GrantCity University of Hong Kong [9610406]";This work was supported in part by the RGC Theme-Based Research Scheme under Grant T32-102/14-N, in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 71901188, and in part by CityU Grant under Grant 9610406.;;54;1;1;4;4;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;1530-437X;1558-1748;;IEEE SENS J;IEEE Sens.

Commercial research-based accelerometers are considered to be more valuable as they measure real-life mobility. Smartphone accelerometry might be an easily accessible alternative. Objective:To explore smartphone accelerometry in comparison to clinical tests, surveys, and a wrist-worn ActiGraph in pwMS and controls. Methods:Sixty-seven pwMS and 70 matched controls underwent mobility tests and surveys. Real-life data were collected with a smartphone and an ActiGraph over 7 days. We explored different smartphone metrics in a technical validation course and computed afterward correlation between ActiGraph (steps per minute), smartphone accelerometry (variance of vector magnitude), clinical tests, and surveys. We also determined the ability to separate between patients and controls as well as between different disability groups. Results:Based on the technical validation, we found the variance of the vector magnitude as a reliable estimate to discriminate wear time and no wear-time of the smartphone. Due to a further association with different activity levels, it was selected for real-life analyses. In the cross-sectional study, ActiGraph correlated moderately (r= 0.43,p< 0.05) with the smartphone but less with clinical tests (rho between |0.211| and |0.337|). Smartphone data showed stronger correlations with age (rho = -0.487) and clinical tests (rho between |0.565| and |0.605|). ActiGraph only differed between pwMS and controls (p< 0.001) but not between disability groups. At the same time, the smartphone showed differences between pwMS and controls, between RRMS and PP-/SPMS, and between participants with/without ambulatory impairment (allp< 0.001). Conclusions:Smartphone accelerometry provides better estimates of mobility and disability than a wrist-worn standard accelerometer in a free-living context for both controls and pwMS. Given the fact that no additional device is needed, smartphone accelerometry might be a convenient outcome of real-life ambulation in healthy individuals and chronic diseases such as MS.;"[Zhai, Yuyang; Nasseri, Navina; Poettgen, Jana; Gezhelbash, Eghbal; Heesen, Christoph; Stellmann, Jan-Patrick] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Inst Neuroimmunol & Multiple Sclerosis, Hamburg, Germany; [Poettgen, Jana; Heesen, Christoph; Stellmann, Jan-Patrick] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Dept Neurol, Hamburg, Germany; [Gezhelbash, Eghbal] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Acad Training & Career, Hamburg, Germany; [Stellmann, Jan-Patrick] Hop La Timone, AP HM, CEMEREM, Marseille, France; [Stellmann, Jan-Patrick] Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, CRMBM, UMR 7339, Marseille, France";"Stellmann, JP (corresponding author), Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Inst Neuroimmunol & Multiple Sclerosis, Hamburg, Germany.; Stellmann, JP (corresponding author), Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Dept Neurol, Hamburg, Germany.; Stellmann, JP (corresponding author), Hop La Timone, AP HM, CEMEREM, Marseille, France.; Stellmann, JP (corresponding author), Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, CRMBM, UMR 7339, Marseille, France.";jan-patrick.stellmann@univ-amu.fr;Stellmann, Jan-Patrick/ABA-7132-2020;Stellmann, Jan-Patrick/0000-0003-2565-2833;BiogenBiogen;Parts of this study were funded by a grant from Biogen.;;45;0;0;1;1;FRONTIERS MEDIA SA;LAUSANNE;AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND;1664-2295;;;FRONT NEUROL;Front.

MS-related fatigue directly impacts on the quality of life and activity levels of people with MS. Self-management strategies are used to support them in the care of their health. Mobile health (mHealth) solutions can offer tools to help symptom management. Following a user-centered design and evidence-based process, an mHealth solution called More Stamina was created to help persons with MS manage their fatigue. Objective: The overall study aims are to explore the feasibility, acceptability, and usability of More Stamina, a mobile app for fatigue self-management for persons with MS. Methods: A mixed-methods, multicenter study will be used to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and usability of More Stamina. The study will take place during the third and fourth quarters of 2020 (Q3-Q4 2020) in 3 locations: Argentina, Spain, and Switzerland.

The awareness of MAP appears to be low in many places and its research is at infant stage in many countries. The lack of worldwide coverage of the MAP research landscape calls for urgent research attention and prioritization. This present study aimed to assess MAP global research productivity with an emphasis on its implications in ADs via bibliometric and growth analytic frameworks from authors, countries, institutions, international, disciplines and collaboration network perspectives. MAP primary articles were retrieved from the Scopus database and the Web of Science from 1911 to 2019 via title-specific algorithm. Analytic results of dataset yielded a total of 3889 articles from 581 journals and 20.65 average citations per documents. The annual growth rate of MAP research for the period was 6.31%. Based on a country's productivity (articles (%), freq. of publication (%)), the USA (887 (22.81%), 26.72%), and Australia (236 (6.07%), 6.07%) ranked the top 2 countries but Egypt and Germany had the highest average growth rate (AGR, 170%) in the last 3 years.

Methods The study enrolled 6 participants with SCA with varying degrees of balance impairment. After adjustment for individual fining, wearable BCS with up to 3% body weight was placed in a garment on the trunk Sway direction and magnitude were measured with sensors placed posteriorly at the lumbosacral junction, immediately before and after, and at day 1, day 2, and day 7 after wearing the BCS. Timed Up & Go test (TUG) and 25-foot timed walk test were performed, and static foot pressure was measured. Results A significant improvement in static and dynamic balance was found during the 25-foot timed walk and in static foot pressure measurement results after wearing the BCS, when compared with that at baseline (p=0.044 vs. p=0.011). Anterior and posterior sway showed improvements from baseline after wearing the BCS. Improvement in the lateral swaying movement control was also seen. Conclusion Application of the BCS might be beneficial in the improvement ofthe static and dynamic balance in patients with SCA.

In order to mitigate its effects, proper rehabilitation therapy is mandatory, in which individualisation is a key factor. Technological solutions can provide the information required for this purpose, by monitoring patients and extracting relevant indicators. In this work, a novel Sensorized Tip is proposed for monitoring People with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS) that require Assistive Devices for Walking (ADW) such as canes or crutches. The developed Sensorized Tip can be adapted to the personal ADW of each patient to reduce its impact, and provides sensor data while naturally walking in the everyday activities. This data that can be processed to obtain relevant indicators that helps assessing the status of the patient. Different from other approaches, a full validation of the proposed processing algorithms is carried out in this work, and a preliminary study-case is carried out with PwMS considering a set of indicators obtained from the Sensorized Tip's processed data. Results of the preliminary study-case demonstrate the potential of the device to monitor and characterise patient status.;"[Brull, Asier; Zubizarreta, Asier; Cabanes, Itziar] Univ Basque Country, Fac Engn Bilbao, Dept Automat & Control Syst, UPV EHU, Ingeniero Torres Quevedo Sq, Bilbao 48013, Biscay, Spain; [Rodriguez-Larrad, Ana] Univ Basque Country, Fac Med & Nursing, Dept Physiol, UPV EHU, Barrio Sarriena S-N, Leioa 48940, Spain";Zubizarreta, A (corresponding author), Univ Basque Country, Fac Engn Bilbao, Dept Automat & Control Syst, UPV EHU, Ingeniero Torres Quevedo Sq, Bilbao 48013, Biscay, Spain.;"asier.brull@ehu.eus; asier.zubizarreta@ehu.eus; itziar.cabanes@ehu.eus; ana.rodriguez@ehu.eus";"Zubizarreta, Asier/O-1200-2019; Cabanes, Itziar/Y-6479-2019";"Zubizarreta, Asier/0000-0001-6049-2308; Cabanes, Itziar/0000-0002-1949-953X; Rodriguez Larrad, Ana/0000-0003-0923-0788; BRULL MESANZA, ASIER/0000-0003-4639-970X";"University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU)University of Basque Country [PIF18/067]; UPV/EHUUniversity of Basque Country [GIU19/045 (GV/EJ IT1381-19)]; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion (MCI)Spanish Government [DPI2017-82694-R]";This research was funded by the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU) grants number PIF18/067, by the UPV/EHU under project number GIU19/045 (GV/EJ IT1381-19) and by the Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion (MCI) under grant number DPI2017-82694-R (AEI/FEDER, UE).;;38;1;1;1;2;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;1424-8220;;SENSORS-BASEL;Sensors;AUG;2020;20;15;;;;;;;4329;10.3390/s20154329;;;20;"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation";"Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation";MZ4BP;WOS:000559067000001;32756509;DOAJ Gold, Green Published;;;2021-03-18;

Currently approved treatments have several shortcomings. Consequently, new and effective treatments with improved safety and convenience profiles are sought after by patients. Objective: To explore the overall profile of vidofludimus for the treatment of RRMS. Methods: Preclinical investigations were done exploring the species-dependency of DHODH inhibition of vidofludimus. In addition, the preclinical efficacy in a rat experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model and the inhibition of cytokine release from activated PBMC were investigated. Pharmacokinetic data were also obtained in a Phase 1 multiple ascending dose trial of the formulation IMU-838 (vidofludimus calcium). Results: It was shown that vidofludimus is 2.6 times more potent in inhibiting DHO oxidation by human DHODH compared to teriflunomide. Although both compounds increased cell apoptosis, vidofludimus was more efficacious in the inhibition of T-lymphocyte proliferation compared to teriflunomide. The same was also observed for the secretion of IL-17 and IFN-gamma. Interestingly, the potency or vidofludimus to inhibit rat or mouse DHODH is 7.5 and 64.4 time lower than the for the human DHODH, respectively. The rat EAE study clearly exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of cumulative disease scores by vidofludimus. In the multiple ascending dose Phase 1 clinical trial, the serum half-life of about 30 h provides a favorable profile for once daily dosing of IMU-838, with quick dosing to steady state through levels within 5 days and the ability to wash out drug quickly, if required. Conclusions: The investigations highlighted that the desired selective immunomodulatory properties can be separated from general antiproliferative effects seen and related adverse events in first-generation DHODH inhibitors. Based on data obtained from a series of pre-clinical as well as phase 1 and phase 2 studies, IMU-838 is a promising next-generation candidate for the oral treatment of RRMS. However, this will need to be confirmed in the currently ongoing Phase 2 study in RRMS patients.;"[Muehler, Andreas; Peelen, Evelyn; Kohlhof, Hella; Groeppel, Manfred; Vitt, Daniel] Immunic AG, Klopferspitz 19, D-82152 Planegg Martinsried, Germany";Muehler, A (corresponding author), Immunic AG, Klopferspitz 19, D-82152 Planegg Martinsried, Germany.;andreas.muehler@imux.com;;;;;;26;5;5;3;3;ELSEVIER SCI LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND;2211-0348;2211-0356;;MULT SCLER RELAT DIS;Mult.

The University of California San Francisco MS BioScreen is a web-based precision medicine tool initially designed to be clinician facing. We aimed to design a second, openly available tool, Open MS BioScreen, that would be accessible, understandable, and actionable by people with MS. Objective: This study aimed to describe the human-centered design and development approach (inspiration, ideation, and implementation) for creating the Open MS Bio Screen platform. Methods: We planned an iterative and cyclical development process that included stakeholder engagement and iterative feedback from users. Stakeholders included patients with MS along with their caregivers and family members, MS experts, generalist clinicians, industry representatives, and advocacy experts. Users consisted of anyone who wants to track MS measurements over time and access openly available tools for people with MS. Phase I (inspiration) consisted of empathizing with users and defining the problem. We sought to understand the main challenges faced by patients and clinicians and what they would want to see in a web-based app. In phase II (ideation), our multidisciplinary team discussed approaches to capture, display, and make sense of user data. Then, we prototyped a series of mock-ups to solicit feedback from clinicians and people with MS. In phase III (implementation), we incorporated all concepts to test and iterate a minimally viable product. We then gathered feedback through an agile development process. The design and development were cyclical-many times throughout the process, we went back to the drawing board. Results: This human-centered approach generated an openly available, web-based app through which patients with MS, their clinicians, and their caregivers can access the site and create an account. Users can enter information about their MS (basic level as well as more advanced concepts), visualize their data longitudinally, access a series of algorithms designed to empower them to make decisions about their treatments, and enter data from wearable devices to encourage realistic goal setting about their ambulatory activity. Agile development will allow us to continue to incorporate precision medicine tools, as these are validated in the clinical research arena. Conclusions: After engaging intended users into the iterative human-centered design of the Open MS Bio Screen, we will now monitor the adaptation and dissemination of the tool as we expand its functionality and reach. The insights generated from this approach can be applied to the development of a number of self-tracking, self-management, and user engagement tools for patients with chronic conditions.;"[Schleimer, Erica; Barnecut, Andrew; Rowles, William; Lizee, Antoine; Block, Valerie J.; Santaniello, Adam; Renschen, Adam; Gomez, Refujia; Keshavan, Anisha; Gelfand, Jeffrey M.; Henry, Roland G.; Hauser, Stephen L.; Bove, Riley] UCSF Weill Inst Neurosci, Dept Neurol, 675 Nelson Rising Lane, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Pearce, Jennifer] Plain Language Hlth, San Francisco, CA USA; [Klein, Arno] Child Mind Inst, New York, NY USA";Bove, R (corresponding author), UCSF Weill Inst Neurosci, Dept Neurol, 675 Nelson Rising Lane, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA.;Riley.bove@ucsf.edu;;"Lizee, Antoine/0000-0002-1073-3190; Rowles, William/0000-0002-5613-0483; Barnecut, Andrew/0000-0003-1003-272X; Pearce, Jennifer/0000-0001-6766-6323; Klein, Arno/0000-0002-0707-2889; Schleimer, Erica/0000-0001-5040-6306";Conrad N.

Currently clinicians rely on self-report measures or simple functional assessments, administered at discrete time points, to assess fall risk. Wearable inertial sensors are a promising technology for increasing the sensitivity of clinical assessments to accurately predict fall risk, but current accelerometer-based approaches are limited. Research question: Will metrics derived from wearable accelerometers during a 30-second chair stand test (30CST) correlate with clinical measures of disease severity, balance confidence and fatigue in PwMS, and can these metrics be used to accurately discriminate fallers from non-fallers? ' Methods: Thirty-eight PwMS (21 fallers) completed self-report outcome measures then performed the 30CST while triaxial acceleration data were collected from inertial sensors adhered to the thigh and chest. Accelerometer metrics were derived for the sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit transitions and relationships with clinical metrics were assessed. Finally, the metrics were used to develop a logistic regression model to classify fall status. Results: Accelerometer-derived metrics were significantly associated with multiple clinical metrics that capture disease severity, balance confidence and fatigue. Performance of a logistic regression for classifying fall status was enhanced by including accelerometer features (accuracy 74%, AUC 0.78) compared to the standard of care (accuracy 68%, AUC 0.74) or patient reported outcomes (accuracy 71%, AUC 0.75). Significance: Accelerometer derived metrics were associated with clinically relevant measures of disease severity, fatigue and balance confidence during a balance challenging task. Inertial sensors could feasibly be utilized to enhance the accuracy of functional assessments to identify fall risk in PwMS. Simplicity of these accelerometer-based metrics could facilitate deployment for community-based monitoring.;"[Tulipani, Lindsey J.; Meyer, Brett; Larie, Dale; McGinnis, Ryan S.] Univ Vermont, Dept Elect & Biomed Engn, M Sense Res Grp, Burlington, VT USA; [Solomon, Andrew J.] Univ Vermont, Dept Neurol Sci, Burlington, VT USA";McGinnis, RS (corresponding author), Dept Elect & Biomed Engn, 33 Colchester Ave, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.;"lindsey.tulipani@uvm.edu; brett.meyer@uvm.edu; dale.larie@uvm.edu; ryan.mcginnis@uvm.edu";;;"UVM College of Engineering and Mathematical Sciences; UVM Medical Center";We gratefully acknowledge UVM Medical Center and UVM College of Engineering and Mathematical Sciencesfor funding to support this study.;;39;0;0;2;3;ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD;CLARE;ELSEVIER HOUSE, BROOKVALE PLAZA, EAST PARK SHANNON, CO, CLARE, 00000, IRELAND;0966-6362;1879-2219;;GAIT POSTURE;Gait Posture;JUL;2020;80;;;;;;361;366;;10.1016/j.gaitpost.2020.06.014;;;6;"Neurosciences; Orthopedics; Sport Sciences";"Neurosciences & Neurology; Orthopedics; Sport Sciences";MK0CT;WOS:000548455400025;32615409;;;;2021-03-18;

These changes in gait have been well studied in laboratory and clinical settings. A thorough investigation of gait alterations during community ambulation and their contributing factors, however, is lacking. The aim of the present study was to evaluate community ambulation and physical activity in pwMS and healthy controls and to compare in-lab gait to community ambulation. To this end, 104 subjects were studied: 44 pwMS and 60 healthy controls (whose age was similar to the controls). The subjects wore a tri-axial, lower back accelerometer during usual-walking and dual-task walking in the lab and during community ambulation (1 week) to evaluate the amount, type, and quality of activity. The results showed that during community ambulation, pwMS took fewer steps and walked more slowly, with greater asymmetry, and larger stride-to-stride variability, compared to the healthy controls (p < 0.001). Gait speed during most of community ambulation was significantly lower than the in-lab usual-walking value and similar to the in-lab dual-tasking value. Significant group (pwMS /controls)-by-walking condition (in-lab/community ambulation) interactions were observed (e.g., gait speed). Greater disability was associated with fewer steps and reduced gait speed during community ambulation. In contrast, physical fatigue was correlated with sedentary activity, but was not related to any of the measures of community ambulation gait quality including gait speed. This disparity suggests that more than one mechanism contributes to community ambulation and physical activity in pwMS. Together, these findings demonstrate that during community ambulation, pwMS have marked gait alterations in multiple gait features, reminiscent of dual-task walking measured in the laboratory.

Indeed, single-molecule detection technologies are foreseen to enable clinicians to associate the tiniest increase in a biomarker with the progression of a disease, particularly at its early stage. Bioelectronic organic transistors represent an extremely powerful tool to achieve label-free and single-molecule detection of clinically relevant biomarkers. These electronic devices are millimetric in size and in the future could be mass-produced at low cost. The core of the single molecule with a large transistor (SiMoT) platform, based on an electrolyte-gated field-effect transistor, is a gold gate electrode biofunctionalized with a self-assembled monolayer, a densely packed layer of recognition elements. So far, only the SiMoT detection of proteins, using the corresponding antibodies as recognition elements, has been reported. In this study, the SiMoT sensing response toward genomic biomarkers is proposed. Herein, the gate is functionalized with a genomic biomarker for multiple sclerosis (miR-182). This is relevant, not only because a limit of detection of a single molecule is achieved but also because it proves that the SiMoT label-free, single-molecule detection principle is the only one of its kind that can detect, by means of the same platform, both protein and genomic markers.;"[Macchia, Eleonora; Osterbacka, Ronald; Torsi, Luisa] Abo Akad Univ, Fac Sci & Engn, Turku 20500, Finland; [Manoli, Kyriaki; Di Franco, Cinzia; Picca, Rosaria Anna; Palazzo, Gerardo; Torsi, Luisa] Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Dipartimento Chim, I-70125 Bari, Italy; [Palazzo, Gerardo; Torsi, Luisa] CSGI Ctr Colloid & Surface Sci, I-70125 Bari, Italy; [Di Franco, Cinzia; Scamarcio, Gaetano] CNR, Ist Foton & Nanotecnol, I-70125 Bari, Italy; [Torricelli, Fabrizio] Univ Brescia, Dipartimento Ingn Informaz, I-25121 Brescia, Italy; [Scamarcio, Gaetano] Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Dipartimento Interateneo Fis M Merlin, I-70125 Bari, Italy";"Torsi, L (corresponding author), Abo Akad Univ, Fac Sci & Engn, Turku 20500, Finland.; Torsi, L (corresponding author), Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Dipartimento Chim, I-70125 Bari, Italy.; Torsi, L (corresponding author), CSGI Ctr Colloid & Surface Sci, I-70125 Bari, Italy.";luisa.torsi@uniba.it;"Osterbacka, Ronald/N-7773-2019; Palazzo, Gerardo/G-9030-2011; Picca, Rosaria Anna/E-7341-2015";"Osterbacka, Ronald/0000-0003-0656-2592; Palazzo, Gerardo/0000-0001-5504-2177; Picca, Rosaria Anna/0000-0001-8033-098X; Macchia, eleonora/0000-0002-1534-7336; Torsi, Luisa/0000-0002-0798-0780";"OrgBIO Organic Bioelectronics [PITN-GA-2013-607896]; PON SISTEMA (MIUR)Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR); H2020-Electronic Smart Systems-SiMBiT: Single molecule bio-electronic smart system array for clinical testing [824946]; Future in Research APQ Ricerca Regione Puglia Programma regionale a sostegno della specializzazione intelligente e della sostenibilita sociale ed ambientale-FutureInResearch-BEND Biosensori elettronici intelligenti per la diagnosi precoce di malattie n [B164PG8]; PMGB-Sviluppo di piattaforme meccatroniche, genomiche e bioinformatiche per l'oncologia di precisione RICERCA E INNOVAZIONE 2014-2020 projects [ARS01_01195-PON]; CSGI";OrgBIO Organic Bioelectronics (PITN-GA-2013-607896), PON SISTEMA (MIUR), H2020-Electronic Smart Systems-SiMBiT: Single molecule bio-electronic smart system array for clinical testing (Grant agreement no. 824946), Future in Research APQ Ricerca Regione Puglia Programma regionale a sostegno della specializzazione intelligente e della sostenibilita sociale ed ambientale-FutureInResearch-BEND Biosensori elettronici intelligenti per la diagnosi precoce di malattie neurodegenerative (B164PG8), PMGB-Sviluppo di piattaforme meccatroniche, genomiche e bioinformatiche per l'oncologia di precisione-ARS01_01195-PON RICERCA E INNOVAZIONE 2014-2020 projects and CSGI are acknowledged for partial financial support.;;50;5;5;5;13;AMER CHEMICAL SOC;WASHINGTON;1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;2379-3694;;;ACS SENSORS;ACS Sens.;JUN 26;2020;5;6;;;;;1822;1830;;10.1021/acssensors.0c00694;;;9;"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Chemistry, Analytical; Nanoscience & Nanotechnology";"Chemistry; Science & Technology - Other Topics";MF9YX;WOS:000545694100039;32495625;Bronze;;;2021-03-18;

Enhancing physical activity (PA) might promote neuroregeneration in multiple sclerosis (MS) and positively influence disability, thus providing an alternative to medical treatment. Previous studies indicate that evidence-based patient information (EBPI) is essential for inducing behavioral change, e.g. enhancing PA. Objective: To investigate feasibility of a smartphone app providing EBPI about the benefit of PA and a simple activity feedback to enhance PA in people with CPMS in a pilot randomized controlled trial over 3 months. Methods: Thirty-eight people with CPMS (mean age 51 years, median Expanded Disability Status Scale 4.0) were 1:1 randomized into either a control group (n = 20) or an intervention group (n = 18). The intervention group received access to a multimedia EBPI app including activity feedback, texts, figures and videos. In the control group, participants received a leaflet with unspecific information about exercising in general. The EPBI itself was designed based on a systematic review. At baseline and after 3 months, all participants underwent clinical performance tests, filled in questionnaires and received an activity monitor (Actigraph (R)) for 7 days. The primary endpoint was the rate of responders defined as participants with a 20% increase of physical acitivity (time of moderate or vigiorous PA-MVPA) or 20% increase of the number of steps, both assessed with the activity monitor. As secondary endpoints, we compared accelerometry, performance and questionnaires adjusted for baseline measurments between the groups (ANCOVA). Moreover, we used questionnaires to compare knowledge about exercise (activity requiring physical effort, carried out to improve or improve health and fitness) in MS, usability of the app in general and motivation towards a more active lifestyle after 3 months in both groups. Results: The groups showed significant differences in disease duration and PA according to the Godin-Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire at baseline. After 3 months, we detected no difference in the rate of responders, which was an overall 22%. However, MVPA significantly increased in both groups (p < 0.001) and the intervention group tended to have a higher motivation towards a more active lifestyle (Cohens D = 0.7, p = 0.09) as measured by the questionnaire. Reponses also showed, that participants appreciated the app but claimed a lack of interactivity as a short-coming. Conclusion: Just providing information in a multimedia smartphone app did not enhance physical activitiy more than a simple leaflet in this small pilot trial in CPMS. However, the group of app users tended to have a higher motivation towards a more active lifestyle. Overall, the concept of a smartphone app to support an active lifestyle in MS is highly appreciated by participants.;"[Nasseri, Navina N.; Ghezelbash, Eghbal; Zhai, Yuyang; Riemann-Lorenz, Karin; Heesen, Christoph; Rahn, Anne C.; Stellmann, Jan-Patrick] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Inst Neuroimmunol & Multiple Sclerosis INIMS, Hamburg, Germany; [Ghezelbash, Eghbal] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Acad Training & Career, Hamburg, Germany; [Patra, Stefan] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Univ Kompetenzzentrum Sport & Bewegungsmed Athlet, Hamburg, Germany; [Patra, Stefan] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Inst & Poliklin Med Psychol, Hamburg, Germany; [Heesen, Christoph; Stellmann, Jan-Patrick] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Dept Neurol, Hamburg, Germany; [Stellmann, Jan-Patrick] Hop La Timone, AP HM, CEMEREM, Marseille, France; [Stellmann, Jan-Patrick] Aix Marseille Univ, CRMBM, CNRS, UMR 7339, Marseille, France";"Stellmann, JP (corresponding author), Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Inst Neuroimmunol & Multiple Sclerosis INIMS, Hamburg, Germany.; Stellmann, JP (corresponding author), Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Dept Neurol, Hamburg, Germany.; Stellmann, JP (corresponding author), Hop La Timone, AP HM, CEMEREM, Marseille, France.; Stellmann, JP (corresponding author), Aix Marseille Univ, CRMBM, CNRS, UMR 7339, Marseille, France.";jan-patrick.stellmann@univ-amu.fr;Stellmann, Jan-Patrick/ABA-7132-2020;"Stellmann, Jan-Patrick/0000-0003-2565-2833; Rahn, Anne/0000-0002-9051-3621";BiogenBiogen;The study was supported by a grant from Biogen.

In order to establish the benefits of this approach, we need to operationalize what is expected in terms of a successful measurement. We focused on three clinical long-term conditions where a novel case has been made for the benefits of RMT: major depressive disorder (MDD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and epilepsy. Objective: The aim of this study was to conduct a consultation exercise on the clinical end point or outcome measurement priorities for RMT studies, drawing on the experiences of people with chronic health conditions. Methods: A total of 24 participants (16/24 women, 67%), ranging from 28 to 65 years of age, with a diagnosis of one of three chronic health conditions - MDD, MS, or epilepsy - took part in six focus groups. A systematic thematic analysis was used to extract themes and subthemes of clinical end point or measurement priorities. Results: The views of people with MDD, epilepsy, and MS differed. Each group highlighted unique measurements of importance, relevant to their specific needs. Although there was agreement that remote measurement could be useful for tracking symptoms of illness, some symptoms were specific to the individual groups. Measuring signs of wellness was discussed more by people with MDD than by people with MS and epilepsy. However, overlap did emerge when considering contextual factors, such as life events and availability of support (MDD and epilepsy) as well as ways of coping (epilepsy and MS). Conclusions: This is a unique study that puts patients' views at the forefront of the design of a clinical study employing novel digital resources. In all cases, measuring symptom severity is key; people want to know when their health is getting worse. Second, symptom severity needs to be placed into context. A holistic approach that, in some cases, considers signs of wellness as well as illness, should be the aim of studies employing RMT to understand the health of people with chronic conditions.";"[Simblett, Sara; Matcham, Faith; Curtis, Hannah; Greer, Ben; Hotopf, Matthew; Wykes, Til] Kings Coll London, Inst Psychiat Psychol & Neurosci, London, England; [Polhemus, Ashley; Novak, Jan; Ferrao, Jose; Gamble, Peter] Merck Sharpe & Dohme, Merck Res Labs IT, Prague, Czech Republic; [Narayan, Vaibhav] Janssen Pharmaceut LLC, Titusville, NJ USA; [Remote Assessment Dis Relapse-Cent] RADAR CNS, London, England";Simblett, S (corresponding author), Kings Coll London, Inst Psychiat Psychol & Neurosci, Psychol Dept, Henry Wellcome Bldg,2nd Floor, London, England.;sara.simblett@kcl.ac.uk;"Hotopf, Matthew/E-4971-2010; Wykes, Til/B-3812-2011";"Wykes, Til/0000-0002-5881-8003; Hotopf, Matthew/0000-0002-3980-4466; Curtis, Hannah/0000-0001-8322-869X; Gamble, Peter/0000-0003-1851-6681; Greer, Ben/0000-0002-8687-4002; Novak, Jan/0000-0001-5545-2723; Matcham, Faith/0000-0002-4055-904X";"Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) 2 Joint Undertaking [115902]; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme; European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA); National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centre at South London and Maudsley National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust; King's College London; NIHRNational Institute for Health Research (NIHR)";This paper was written as part of the development of useful mHealth and RMT systems in the Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse - Central Nervous System (RADAR-CNS) project.

Overground robotic (OR) wearable exoskeletons are promising tools for gait rehabilitation, but currently there is no evidence of their clinical effects on patients with MS. The present study aims to determine the effects of an OR intervention in people with MS and moderate to severe walking disabilities and ascertain if benefits are maintained over a follow-up period of 3 months. This randomized controlled trial will include 36 participants with MS. Inclusion criteria are: older than 18 years, definitive diagnosis of MS, 4.5-7 points on the EDSS (Expanded Disability Status Scale), and needing one or two canes or crutches for walking outdoors. Subjects in the control group will receive conventional physiotherapy sessions at ADEMBI (Asociacion de Esclerosis Multiple de Bizkaia) provided to control spasticity, maintain articular range and exercise balance. Subjects in the intervention group will receive the same physiotherapy but also participate in a progressive OR gait training program assisted by the Ekso (TM) exoskeleton. The program consists of twice a week individually supervised sessions in two setting modalities:PreGaitandProStepPlus. The training parameters (duration, speed, cadence, length of steps) will be set during the first session and the progression and intensity of the intervention will be adapted to the tolerance of each participant. The primary outcome of this study is gait speed. Secondary outcomes will include physical and cognitive performance tests, clinical, fatigue and quality of life assessments, and changes in the plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines. The present trial is the first analyzing the effectiveness of an OR intervention for gait training in patients with MS. It will help clarify the applicability of robotic technologies to clinical practice, extending the functionality and quality of life of people with MS to face a successful aging process.

Recent findings The digitization of most clinical data, along with developments in communication technologies, miniaturization of sensors and computational advances are enabling aggregation and clinically meaningful analyses of real-world data from patient registries, digital patient-reported outcomes and electronic health records (EHR). These data are allowing more confident descriptions of prognoses for multiple sclerosis patients and the long-term relative benefits and safety of disease-modifying treatments (DMT). Registries allow detailed, multiple sclerosis-specific data to be shared between clinicians more easily, provide data needed to improve the impact of DMT and, with EHR, characterize clinically relevant interactions between multiple sclerosis and other diseases. Wearable sensors provide continuous, long-term measures of performance dynamics in relevant ecological settings.

Under physiological conditions, ageing leads to a progressive decline in balance control per se. Moreover, various neurological disorders further increase the risk of falls by deteriorating specific nervous system functions contributing to balance. Over the last 15 years, significant advancements in technology have provided wearable solutions for balance evaluation and the management of postural instability in patients with neurological disorders. This narrative review aims to address the topic of balance and wireless sensors in several neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, stroke, and other neurodegenerative and acute clinical syndromes. The review discusses the physiological and pathophysiological bases of balance in neurological disorders as well as the traditional and innovative instruments currently available for balance assessment. The technical and clinical perspectives of wearable technologies, as well as current challenges in the field of teleneurology, are also examined.;"[Zampogna, Alessandro; Suppa, Antonio] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Human Neurosci, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Mileti, Ilaria; Palermo, Eduardo] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, I-00184 Rome, Italy; [Celletti, Claudia; Paoloni, Marco; Camerota, Filippo] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Phys Med & Rehabil, I-00161 Rome, Italy; [Manoni, Alessandro; Mazzetta, Ivan; Irrera, Fernanda] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Informat Engn Elect & Telecommun, I-00184 Rome, Italy; [Dalla Costa, Gloria; Leocani, Letizia] Univ Vita Salute, INSPE Inst Expt Neurol, Dept Neurorehabil, I-20132 Milan, Italy; [Dalla Costa, Gloria; Leocani, Letizia] Univ Vita Salute, INSPE Inst Expt Neurol, Expt Neurophysiol Unit, I-20132 Milan, Italy; [Dalla Costa, Gloria; Leocani, Letizia] Hosp San Raffaele, I-20132 Milan, Italy; [Perez-Lopez, Carlos; Cabestany, Joan] Univ Politecn Cataluna, Tech Res Ctr Dependency Care & Autonomous Living, Barcelona 08800, Spain; [Perez-Lopez, Carlos; Cabestany, Joan] Sense4Care, Cornelia De Llobregat 08940, Spain; [Suppa, Antonio] IRCCS Neuromed, I-86077 Pozzilli, IS, Italy";"Suppa, A (corresponding author), Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Human Neurosci, I-00185 Rome, Italy.; Suppa, A (corresponding author), IRCCS Neuromed, I-86077 Pozzilli, IS, Italy.";"alessandro.zampogna@uniroma1.it; ilaria.mileti@uniroma1.it; eduardo.palermo@uniroma1.it; clacelletti@gmail.com; marco.paoloni@uniroma1.it; alessandro.manoni@uniroma1.it; ivan.mazzetta@uniroma1.it; dallacosta.gloria@hsr.it; carlos.perez-lopez@upc.edu; filippo.camerota@uniroma1.it; leocani.letizia@hsr.it; joan.cabestany@upc.edu; fernanda.irrera@uniroma1.it; antonio.suppa@uniroma1.it";"Leocani, Letizia/ABH-4703-2020; Costa, Gloria Dalla/F-6440-2017; Cabestany, Joan/F-2281-2015; Suppa, Antonio/K-4803-2016";"Costa, Gloria Dalla/0000-0002-8761-9337; Zampogna, Alessandro/0000-0002-0227-1993; Paoloni, Marco/0000-0002-0947-9711; Manoni, Alessandro/0000-0003-1232-0354; PALERMO, Eduardo/0000-0002-3213-8261; Perez Lopez, Carlos/0000-0001-7400-4360; Irrera, Fernanda/0000-0003-1831-6786; Cabestany, Joan/0000-0002-6926-3322; Celletti, Claudia/0000-0001-7154-5882; MILETI, ILARIA/0000-0002-1064-7962; Suppa, Antonio/0000-0001-9903-5550";;;;224;5;5;4;4;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;1424-8220;;SENSORS-BASEL;Sensors;JUN;2020;20;11;;;;;;;3247;10.3390/s20113247;;;32;"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation";"Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation";MQ2OZ;WOS:000552737900240;32517315;DOAJ Gold, Green Published;;;2021-03-18;

To successfully perform rapid repetitive movements such as tapping, a person must be able to consistently turn on and off motor units to switch between the up and down movement phases. However, it is not clear which specific movement phase that occurs during tapping is different between MS subtypes. The objective of this study was to quantify and characterize performance differences during rapid hand- and foot-tapping tests between relapsing-remitting (RRMS) and progressive (PMS) forms of MS, as well as how both subtypes differ from non-MS controls. Methods: Participants in this study included 30 non-MS controls, 32 RRMS, and 31 PMS. Participants wore inertial sensors on all hands and feet and were instructed to tap as fast as possible for 10 s. Angular velocity from the gyroscope was used to quantify inter-tap interval (ms), coefficient of variation of inter-tap interval (COV), and up- and down-movement characteristics (duration (ms), COV, peak angular velocity (rad/s)). Differences between groups were examined with ANOVA and independent t-tests. Inter-tap interval was examined for its ability to distinguish between RRMS and PMS by a binary logistic regression analysis. Up-down movement characteristics were further evaluated for within-group directional differences (up- vs. down-phase movement components) with paired-sample t-tests. Results: Inter-tap interval for both hand- and foot-tapping differed between controls and MS, but only foot tapping was different between RRMS and PMS (RRMS = 286.7 +/- 83.0 ms; PMS = 379.5 +/- 170.9 ms; mean difference (d) = -92.8 ms). Logistic regression analysis showed foot-tap interval but not hand-tap interval has the potential to distinguish between RRMS and PMS (Area under the ROC = 0.71). Both up- and down-movement duration differences were consistent with the results for inter-tap interval, but up-movement duration showed larger mean group differences than down-movement differences. No significant group differences in overall inter-tap interval COV were detected for either hand- or foot-tapping; however, up-movement foot-tapping variation (CON = 18.7 +/- 6.1; RRMS = 25.5 +/- 11.2; PMS = 23.3 +/- 8.6; CON vs RRMS d = -6.8; CON vs PMS d = -4.7), but not down-movement variation was different between controls and MS. Up- and down-peak angular velocity during foot-tapping were different between controls and PMS (CON Up = 1.4 +/- 0.5 rad/s; PMS Up = 1.0 +/- 0.4 rad/s; Up d = 0.4 rad/s; CON Down= 1.5 +/- 0.6 rad/s; PMS Down = 1.2 +/- 0.5 rad/s; Down d = 0.3 rad/s), and up-movement peak angular velocity differences showed larger mean group differences than the down-movement peak angular velocity between controls and PMS. Conclusion: Foot-tapping differs between MS disease subtypes and has greater potential than hand-tapping to distinguish between subtypes. Performance in the up-movement showed larger group differences than the down-movement, suggesting that the anti-gravity up-movement during tapping may be more important diagnostically. Future studies should be conducted on the nature of the physiological mechanisms underlying impairments in anti-gravity movements in people with MS.";"[Sato, Sumire; van Emmerik, Richard E.

This study aims to identify reliable and objective gait-based biomarkers to monitor progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) in clinical settings. During routine clinical visits, 57 people with secondary progressive MS and 24 healthy controls walked for 6 minutes wearing three inertial motion sensors. Fifteen gait measures were computed from the sensor data and tested for between-session reliability, for differences between controls and people with moderate and severe MS disability, and for correlation with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores. The majority of gait measures showed good to excellent between-session reliability when assessed in a subgroup of 23 healthy controls and 25 people with MS. These measures showed that people with MS walked with significantly longer step and stride durations, reduced step and stride regularity, and experienced difficulties in controlling and maintaining a stable walk when compared to controls. These abnormalities significantly increased in people with a higher level of disability and correlated with their EDSS scores. Reliable and objective gait-based biomarkers using wearable sensors have been identified. These biomarkers may allow clinicians to quantify clinically relevant alterations in gait in people with progressive MS within the context of regular clinical visits.;"[Angelini, Lorenza; Mazza, Claudia] Univ Sheffield, Dept Mech Engn, Pam Liversidge Bldg,Mappin St, Sheffield S1 3JD, S Yorkshire, England; [Angelini, Lorenza; Mazza, Claudia] Univ Sheffield, Insigneo Inst Silico Med, Pam Liversidge Bldg,Mappin St, Sheffield S1 3JD, S Yorkshire, England; [Hodgkinson, William; Smith, Craig; Dodd, Jessie Moorman] Univ Sheffield, Med Sch, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Sharrack, Basil] Sheffield Teaching Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, Acad Dept Neurosci, Sheffield NIHR Neurosci BRC, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Paling, David] Sheffield Teaching Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, Sheffield Inst Translat Neurosci, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England";"Angelini, L (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Dept Mech Engn, Pam Liversidge Bldg,Mappin St, Sheffield S1 3JD, S Yorkshire, England.; Angelini, L (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Insigneo Inst Silico Med, Pam Liversidge Bldg,Mappin St, Sheffield S1 3JD, S Yorkshire, England.";"L.Angelini@sheffield.ac.uk; drwillhodg@gmail.com; craigsmxth@gmail.com; jefamd@gmail.com; basil.sharrack@nhs.net; c.mazza@sheffield.ac.uk; david.paling@nhs.net";;"Mazza, Claudia/0000-0002-5215-1746; Angelini, Lorenza/0000-0002-4763-7717";"NIHR through the Sheffield Biomedical Research Centre (BRC) [IS-BRC-1215-20017]; European UnionEuropean Commission; EFPIA via the Innovative Medicine Initiative 2 (Mobilise-D project) [IMI22017-13-7-820820]; UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/K03877X/1, EP/S032940/1]";This study was co-funded by the NIHR through the Sheffield Biomedical Research Centre (BRC, grant number IS-BRC-1215-20017), by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme and EFPIA via the Innovative Medicine Initiative 2 (Mobilise-D project, grant number IMI22017-13-7-820820), and the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (Multisim and MultiSim2 projects, grant numbers EP/K03877X/1 and EP/S032940/1, respectively).

Accurate and repeatable measures of cognition have the potential to be used as markers of disease activity. Methods We developed a 5-min computerized test to measure cognitive dysfunction in patients with MS. The proposed test - named the Integrated Cognitive Assessment (ICA) - is self-administered and language-independent. Ninety-one MS patients and 83 healthy controls (HC) took part in Substudy 1, in which each participant took the ICA test and the Brief International Cognitive Assessment for MS (BICAMS). We assessed ICA's test-retest reliability, its correlation with BICAMS, its sensitivity to discriminate patients with MS from the HC group, and its accuracy in detecting cognitive dysfunction. In Substudy 2, we recruited 48 MS patients, 38 of which had received an 8-week physical and cognitive rehabilitation programme and 10 MS patients who did not. We examined the association between the level of serum neurofilament light (NfL) in these patients and their ICA scores and Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) scores pre- and post-rehabilitation. Results The ICA demonstrated excellent test-retest reliability (r = 0.94), with no learning bias, and showed a high level of convergent validity with BICAMS. The ICA was sensitive in discriminating the MS patients from the HC group, and demonstrated high accuracy (AUC = 95%) in discriminating cognitively normal from cognitively impaired participants. Additionally, we found a strong association (r = - 0.79) between ICA score and the level of NfL in MS patients before and after rehabilitation. Conclusions The ICA has the potential to be used as a digital marker of cognitive impairment and to monitor response to therapeutic interventions. In comparison to standard cognitive tools for MS, the ICA is shorter in duration, does not show a learning bias, and is independent of language.;"[Khaligh-Razavi, Seyed-Mahdi; Kalafatis, Chris] Cognetivity Ltd, London, England; [Khaligh-Razavi, Seyed-Mahdi; Khanbagi, Mahdiyeh; Nabavi, Seyed Massood] ACECR, Royan Inst Stem Cell Biol & Technol, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Cell Sci Res Ctr, Tehran, Iran; [Sadeghi, Maryam] Univ Tehran, Tehran, Iran; [Kalafatis, Chris] South London & Maudsley NHS Fdn Trust, London, England; [Kalafatis, Chris] Kings Coll London, Dept Old Age Psychiat, London, England";"Khaligh-Razavi, SM (corresponding author), Cognetivity Ltd, London, England.; Khaligh-Razavi, SM (corresponding author), ACECR, Royan Inst Stem Cell Biol & Technol, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Cell Sci Res Ctr, Tehran, Iran.";seyed@cognetivity.com;;"Kalafatis, Chris/0000-0002-7171-5391; Khaligh-Razavi, Seyed-Mahdi/0000-0002-5700-1704";Iranian National Elite Foundation;"SMKR was funded by a return home fellowship grant from the Iranian National Elite Foundation.

Many health care programs that use RMT rely on commercially available, off-the-shelf devices to collect patient data. However, validation of these devices is sparse, the technology landscape is constantly changing, relative benefits between device options are often unclear, and research on patient and health care provider preferences is often lacking. Objective: To address these common challenges, we propose a novel device selection framework extrapolated from human-centered design principles, which are commonly used in de novo digital health product design. We then present a case study in which we used the framework to identify, test, select, and implement off-the-shelf devices for the Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse-Central Nervous System (RADAR-CNS) consortium, a research program using RMT to study central nervous system disease progression. Methods: The RADAR-CNS device selection framework describes a human-centered approach to device selection for mobile health programs. The framework guides study designers through stakeholder engagement, technology landscaping, rapid proof of concept testing, and creative problem solving to develop device selection criteria and a robust implementation strategy. It also describes a method for considering compromises when tensions between stakeholder needs occur. Results: The framework successfully guided device selection for the RADAR-CNS study on relapse in multiple sclerosis. In the initial stage, we engaged a multidisciplinary team of patients, health care professionals, researchers, and technologists to identify our primary device-related goals. We desired regular home-based measurements of gait, balance, fatigue, heart rate, and sleep over the course of the study. However, devices and measurement methods had to be user friendly, secure, and able to produce high quality data. In the second stage, we iteratively refined our strategy and selected devices based on technological and regulatory constraints, user feedback, and research goals. At several points, we used this method to devise compromises that addressed conflicting stakeholder needs. We then implemented a feedback mechanism into the study to gather lessons about devices to improve future versions of the RADAR-CNS program. Conclusions: The RADAR device selection framework provides a structured yet flexible approach to device selection for health care programs and can be used to systematically approach complex decisions that require teams to consider patient experiences alongside scientific priorities and logistical, technical, or regulatory constraints.;"[Polhemus, Ashley Marie; Novak, Jan; Ferrao, Jose; Temesi, Gergely] Merck Sharpe & Dohme, Merck Res Labs Informat Technol, Svornosti 3321-2, Prague 15000, Czech Republic; [Polhemus, Ashley Marie] Univ Zurich, Epidemiol Biostat & Prevent Inst, Zurich, Switzerland; [Novak, Jan] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Anthropol & Human Genet, Prague, Czech Republic; [Simblett, Sara; Matcham, Faith; Kerz, Maximilian; Wykes, Til; Folarin, Amos; Dobson, Richard; Hotopf, Matthew] Kings Coll London, Inst Psychiat Psychol & Neurosci, London, England; [Radaelli, Marta; Comi, Giancarlo] Osped San Raffaele, Neurol Serv, Multiple Sclerosis Ctr, Milan, Italy; [Locatelli, Patrick] Univ Bergamo, Dept Engn & Appl Sci, Bergamo, Italy; [Matcham, Faith; Wykes, Til; Folarin, Amos; Hotopf, Matthew] South London & Maudsley NHS Fdn Trust, Maudsley Biomed Res Ctr, Natl Inst Hlth Res, London, England; [Weyer, Janice; Burke, Patrick] Kings Coll London, Remote Assessment Dis & Relapse Res Program, Patient Advisory Board, London, England; [Huang, Vincy] Merck Sharpe & Dohme, Merck Res Labs Informat Technol, Singapore, Singapore; [Dockendorf, Marissa Fallon] Merck & Co Inc, Pharmacokinet Pharmacodynam & Drug Metab, Kenilworth, NJ USA; [Myin-Germeys, Inez] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Contextual Psychiat, Dept Neurosci, Leuven, Belgium; [Manyakov, Nikolay, V] Janssen Pharmaceut NV, Beerse, Belgium; [Narayan, Vaibhav A.] Janssen Res & Dev LLC, Res & Dev Informat Technol, Titusville, NJ USA";Polhemus, AM (corresponding author), Merck Sharpe & Dohme, Merck Res Labs Informat Technol, Svornosti 3321-2, Prague 15000, Czech Republic.;ashley.polhemus@merck.com;"Hotopf, Matthew/E-4971-2010; Wykes, Til/B-3812-2011; dobson, richard/C-9269-2011";"Wykes, Til/0000-0002-5881-8003; Manyakov, Nikolay/0000-0001-9037-1400; Folarin, Amos/0000-0002-0333-1927; Hotopf, Matthew/0000-0002-3980-4466; Locatelli, Patrick/0000-0002-3796-8512; Matcham, Faith/0000-0002-4055-904X; Huang, Vincy/0000-0002-2569-0701; dobson, richard/0000-0003-4224-9245; Novak, Jan/0000-0001-5545-2723";"RADAR-CNS program; RADAR-CNS consortium; Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 Joint Undertaking [115902]; European UnionEuropean Commission; European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA); National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centre at South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust and King's College London";"This paper was written in support of the RADAR-CNS program, a collaborative research effort focusing on the development of RMT for monitoring central nervous system disease progression.

The management of motor symptoms in those with MS remains a therapeutic challenge. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a type of non-invasive brain stimulation that is emerging as a promising rehabilitative tool but requires further characterization to determine its optimal therapeutic use. In this randomized, sham-controlled proof-of-concept study, we tested the immediate effects of a single tDCS session on walking and functional mobility in those with MS. Seventeen participants with MS completed one 20-min session of aerobic exercise, randomly assigned to be paired with either active (2.5 mA, n = 9) or sham (n = 8) tDCS over the primary motor cortex (M1). The groups (active vs. sham) were matched according to gender (50% vs. 60% F), age (52.1 +/- 12.85 vs. 54.2 +/- 8.5 years), and level of neurological disability (median Expanded Disability Status Scale score 5.5 vs. 5). Gait speed on the 10-m walk test and the Timed Up and Go (TUG) time were measured by a wearable inertial sensor immediately before and following the 20-min session, with changes compared between conditions and time. There were no significant differences in gait speed or TUG time changes following the session in the full sample or between the active vs. sham groups. These findings suggest that a single session of anodal tDCS over M1 is not sufficient to affect walking and functional mobility in those with MS. Instead, behavioral motor response of tDCS is likely to be cumulative, and the effects of multiple tDCS sessions require further study.;"[Pilloni, Giuseppina; Krupp, Lauren B.; Charvet, Leigh E.] NYU Langone Hlth, Dept Neurol, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Pilloni, Giuseppina; Pau, Massimiliano] Univ Cagliari, Dept Mech Chem & Mat Engn, Cagliari, Italy; [Choi, Claire] SUNY Downstate, Dept Med, New York, NY USA; [Coghe, Giancarlo; Cocco, Eleonora] Univ Cagliari, Dept Med Sci & Publ Hlth, Cagliari, Italy";"Pilloni, G (corresponding author), NYU Langone Hlth, Dept Neurol, New York, NY 10016 USA.; Pilloni, G (corresponding author), Univ Cagliari, Dept Mech Chem & Mat Engn, Cagliari, Italy.";Giuseppina.Pilloni@nyulangone.org;Cocco, Eleonora/G-5064-2012;"Cocco, Eleonora/0000-0002-3878-8820; Charvet, Leigh/0000-0003-4429-9713; krupp, lauren/0000-0001-7003-807X";Lourie Foundation, Inc.;This study was supported by the Lourie Foundation, Inc.;;65;3;3;1;3;FRONTIERS MEDIA SA;LAUSANNE;AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND;1664-2295;;;FRONT NEUROL;Front.

In this context, this method has long been an integral part solely in neurological disorders such as cerebral palsy. However, in the meantime the benefits have also become apparent in other medical areas, such as foot surgery, orthopaedic technology, or in patients after lower limb amputation. These procedures proved to better understand, objectify and quantify the individual causes of gait and movement disorders in order to optimize patient-specific therapy. Currently we are able to rely on a multitude of available measurement systems. These can either be used in everyday life for simple monitoring of one's own activity or to complement therapeutic approaches in the clinical and scientific environment. The following review highlights the various fields of movement analysis, including markerless motion capture, marker-based analysis, pedobarography and wearable sensors. Each of these areas presents its own field of application and potential usage as well as the advantages and disadvantages arising in this context. The following article will give an overview of the type of measurement technology used, the respective fields of application, and the selected parameters and their interpretation possibilities for each of the areas mentioned.

Data collected in these ecologically valid, patient-relevant settings can overcome limitations of conventional clinical assessments, as they capture fluctuating and rare events. These data could support clinical decision making and could also serve as outcomes in clinical trials. However, studies that directly compared assessments made in unsupervised and supervised (eg, in the laboratory or hospital) settings point to large disparities, even in the same parameters of mobility. These differences appear to be affected by psychological, physiological, cognitive, environmental, and technical factors, and by the types of mobilities and diagnoses assessed. To facilitate the successful adaptation of the unsupervised assessment of mobility into clinical practice and clinical trials, clinicians and researchers should consider these disparities and the multiple factors that contribute to them.;"[Warmerdam, Elke; Hansen, Clint; Maetzler, Walter] Univ Kiel, Dept Neurol, Kiel, Germany; [Warmerdam, Elke; Schmidt, Gerhard] Univ Kiel, Fac Engn, Kiel, Germany; [Hausdorff, Jeffrey M.; Mirelman, Anat] Tel Aviv Sourasky Med Ctr, Ctr Study Movement Cognit & Mobil, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Hausdorff, Jeffrey M.; Mirelman, Anat] Tel Aviv Univ, Sackler Fac Med, Dept Phys Therapy, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Hausdorff, Jeffrey M.; Mirelman, Anat] Tel Aviv Univ, Sagol Sch Neurosci, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Hausdorff, Jeffrey M.] Rush Univ, Med Ctr, Alzheimers Dis Ctr, Chicago, IL 60612 USA; [Hausdorff, Jeffrey M.] Rush Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Chicago, IL 60612 USA; [Atrsaei, Arash; Aminian, Kamiar] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Lab Movement Anal & Measurement, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Zhou, Yuhan; Lamoth, Claudine] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Ctr Human Movement Sci, Groningen, Netherlands; [Evers, Luc J.

We describe the Draw a Shape (DaS) Test, a smartphone-based and remotely administered test of Upper Extremity (UE) function developed for people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). This work introduces DaS-related features that characterise UE function and impairment, and aims to demonstrate how multivariate modelling of these metrics can reliably predict the 9-Hole Peg Test (9HPT), a clinician-administered UE assessment in PwMS.Approach: The DaS Test instructed PwMS and healthy controls (HC) to trace predefined shapes on a smartphone screen. A total of 93 subjects (HC,n= 22; PwMS,n= 71) contributed both dominant and non-dominant handed DaS tests. PwMS subjects were characterised as those with normal (nPwMS,n= 50) and abnormal UE function (aPwMS,n= 21) with respect to their average 9HPT time (<= or > 22.7 (s), respectively).L-1-regularization techniques, combined with linear least squares (OLS, IRLS), or non-linear support vector (SVR) or random forest (RFR) regression were investigated as functions to map relevant DaS features to 9HPT times.Main results: It was observed that average non-dominant handed 9HPT times were more accurately predicted by DaS features (r(2)= 0.41,P<<i0.05; MAE: 2.08 +/- 0.34 (s)) than average dominant handed 9HPTs (r(2)= 0.39,P<<i0.05; MAE: 2.32 +/- 0.43 (s)), using simple linear IRLS (P<<i0.01). Moreover, it was found that the Mean absolute error (MAE) in predicted 9HPTs was comparable to the variability of actual 9HPT times within HC, nPwMS and aPwMS groups respectively. The 9HPT however exhibited large heteroscedasticity resulting in less stable predictions of longer 9HPT times.Significance: This study demonstrates the potential of the smartphone-based DaS Test to reliably predict 9HPT times and remotely monitor UE function in PwMS.";"[Creagh, A.

MS results in declines in physical activity and peak oxygen consumption that might be independently associated with declines in walking performance. Therefore our purpose was to evaluate the association between physical activity and peak oxygen consumption with walking performance in individuals with MS. Methods: Fifty individuals with MS between the ages of 18-70 yrs. (Female: 38; 46 +/- 12 yrs.; BMI: 28.5 +/- 6.4; EDSS: 3.3 [IQR: 2.5-4]) performed a maximal incremental cycle test to assess peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak), and wore an accelerometer for one week to measure moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Subjects further completed a timed 25-foot walk test (T25FW) and 6-minute walk (6MW) to measure walking performance. Results: MVPA and VO2peak were correlated with 6MW and T25FW (p < 0.05). When combined in multivariate regression analyses, VO2peak and MVPA were both significant contributors of T25FW speed and 6MW, but after controlling for sex and age, MVPA was the only significant contributor (beta = 0.32 and beta = 0.44, respectively). Conclusion: Both higher MVPA and VO2peak were associated with better walking performance and in a combined model physical activity, but not peak oxygen consumption, remained an independent contributor to walking performance in individuals with MS. These results suggest that improving MVPA is a potential target for interventions to improve walking performance in persons with MS.";"[Hibner, Brooks A.; Schroeder, Elizabeth C.; Grigoriadis, Georgios; Baynard, Tracy; Fernhall, Bo] Univ Illinois, Integrat Physiol Lab, Chicago, IL USA; [Hilgenkamp, Thessa I.

Fatigue is a debilitating symptom in multiple sclerosis (MS) that may be associated with reduced physical activity and increased sedentary behavior. Objective. This study examined the associations among fatigue and device-measured physical activity and sedentary behavior in people with MS. Methods. The participants (n = 252) completed the Patient Determined Disease Steps (PDDS) and Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and wore a waist-mounted accelerometer for 7 days. Participants were divided into 2 groups based on fatigue severity as measured by the FSS scale. We compared percentage of wear time spent in sedentary, light physical activity (LPA), and moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) between the 2 groups. Results. Persons in the fatigued group (FSS score >= 4) spent a greater percentage of time in sedentary behavior (P = .004) and a lower percentage of time in LPA (P = .035). Persons in the fatigued group further spent a lower percentage of time in nontransformed MVPA (P < .001) and square-root-transformed MVPA (P < .001) than persons in the nonfatigued group. When controlling for PDDS scores and years of education, there were no longer significant differences between groups in sedentary behavior, LPA, or transformed MVPA values; the difference in nontransformed MVPA was still statistically significant but likely the result of nonnormally distributed data. Conclusion. The present study suggests that factors other than fatigue might be associated with physical activity and sedentary behavior in MS, and this group might benefit from focal behavioral interventions that take into account mobility status in persons with MS who have fatigue.";"[Neal, Whitney N.; Cederberg, Katie L.; Jeng, Brenda; Motl, Robert W.] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Birmingham, AL USA; [Sasaki, Jeffer E.] Univ Fed Triangulo Mineiro, Uberaba, MG, Brazil";Motl, RW (corresponding author), Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Phys Therapy, 336 SHPB,1716 9th Ave South, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA.;robmotl@uab.edu;;Neal, Whitney/0000-0002-8019-3759;"National Multiple Sclerosis SocietyNational Multiple Sclerosis Society [PP 1412, MB 0011]; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI) [T32HL105349]";The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The research was supported, in part, by a pilot grant from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (PP 1412), a mentor-based postdoctoral fellowship from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (MB 0011), and a predoctoral fellowship from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health (T32HL105349).

Materials and Methods The sample consisted of 30 persons with mild-to-moderate PD and 30 controls matched by age and sex. Participants performed a 6-minute bout of over-ground walking at comfortable speed, and then completed three, 6-minute bouts of treadmill walking at 13.4 m/min slower, comfortable, and 13.4 m/min faster than comfortable speeds. The three treadmill speeds were based on the initial over-ground walking speed. The total number of steps per treadmill walking bout was recorded using a hand-tally counter, and energy expenditure was measured using a portable, indirect spirometry system. Results The results indicated a strong association between step-rate and energy expenditure for persons with PD (R-2 = .92) and controls (R-2 = .92). The analyses further indicated a steeper slope of the association for persons with PD compared with controls (t(58) = -1.87, P .05), resulting in a lower step-rate threshold (t(58) = 2.19, P < .05) for persons with PD (similar to 80 steps center dot per minutes) than controls (similar to 93 steps center dot per minutes). Conclusion Collectively, these results support the application of this disease-specific step-rate threshold for MVPA among persons with PD.

Inertial measurement units (IMUs) provide reliable and yet easy quantitative gait assessment in routine clinical settings. However, to the best of our knowledge, no automated step-detection algorithm performs well in detecting severely altered pMS gait. Method: This article elaborates on a step-detection method based on personalized templates tested against a gold standard. Twenty-two individuals with pMS and 10 young healthy subjects (HSs) were instructed to walk on an electronic walkway wearing synchronized IMUs. Templates were derived from the IMU signals by using Initial and Final Contact times given by the walkway. These were used to detect steps from other gait trials of the same individual (intra-individual template-based detection, IITD) or another participant from the same group (pMS or HS) (intra-group template-based detection, IGTD). All participants were seen twice with a 6-month interval, with two measurements performed at each visit. Performance and accuracy metrics were computed, along with a similarity index (SId), which was computed as the mean distance between detected steps and their respective closest template. Results: For HS participants, both the IITD and the IGTD algorithms had precision and recall of 1.00 for detecting steps. For pMS participants, precision and recall ranged from 0.94 to 1.00 for IITD and 0.85 to 0.95 for IGTD depending on the level of disability. The SId was correlated with performance and the accuracy of the result. An SId threshold of 0.957 (IITD) and 0.963 (IGTD) could rule out decreased performance (F-measure <= 0.95), with negative predictive values of 0.99 and 0.96 with the IITD and IGTD algorithms. Also, the SId computed with the IITD and IGTD algorithms could distinguish individuals showing changes at 6-month follow-up. Conclusion: This personalized step-detection method has high performance for detecting steps in pMS individuals with severely altered gait. The algorithm can be self-evaluating with the SI, which gives a measure of the confidence the clinician can have in the detection. What is more, the SId can be used as a biomarker of change in disease severity occurring between the two measurement times.;"[Vienne-Jumeau, Alienor; Oudre, Laurent; Quijoux, Flavien; Vidal, Pierre Paul; Ricard, Damien] Univ Paris 05, Serv Sante Armees, UMR 8257, COGNAC G,CNRS, Paris, France; [Oudre, Laurent] Univ Paris 13, L2TI, Villetaneuse, France; [Oudre, Laurent] ENS Paris Saclay, UMR 8536, CNRS, CMLA, Cachan, France; [Moreau, Albane; Edmond, Sebastien; Dandrieux, Melanie; Legendre, Eva; Ricard, Damien] Hop Instruct Armees Percy, Serv Neurol, Serv Sante Armees, Clamart, France; [Quijoux, Flavien] ORPEA Grp, Puteaux La Defense, France; [Vidal, Pierre Paul] Hangzhou Dianzi Univ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Ricard, Damien] Ecole Sante Armees, Ecole Val de Grace, Paris, France";Vienne-Jumeau, A (corresponding author), Univ Paris 05, Serv Sante Armees, UMR 8257, COGNAC G,CNRS, Paris, France.;alienor.vienne@parisdescartes.fr;;;"SATT-IDF INNOV; Institut pour la Recherche sur la Moelle epiniere et l'Encephale (IRME)";This work was supported by SATT-IDF INNOV and Institut pour la Recherche sur la Moelle epiniere et l'Encephale (IRME).

The efficacy of SVT has never been examined in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS), therefore, our aim was to examine the immediate effect of SVT on cognitive function, gait and static balance performance in PwMS. This assessor-blinded, randomized crossover study included 26 PwMS, 16 females, mean age 47.9 and median EDSS score 4.5. Participants attended two sessions: SVT and control training. Exercises for both the SVT and control sessions were based on ball-catching tasks. Training sessions were identical in length (40-50 min) and type of exercise drills. The difference between the two practice regimes was that the SVT session was performed wearing stroboscopic glasses and the control training was performed with similar glasses without lenses. Cognition was evaluated by a computerized software (Mindstreams(R), NeuroTrax Corp., NY). Gait and balance were evaluated via wearable accelerometers (APDM, Oregon, USA). Outcome measures were collected twice during a single session, prior to training and immediately afterward. Information processing speed (p = 0.003) increased at the post-evaluation compared with baseline, solely in the SVT session. No differences between pre-post evaluations were observed for other cognitive scores following the SVT session. No differences between pre-post measurements were noted for gait and balance following the SVT session. The present study's results justify performing future RCT studies to examine the effects of a longer SVT program on cognition in PwMS.;"[Shalmoni, Nov; Kalron, Alon] Tel Aviv Univ, Sackler Fac Med, Sch Hlth Profess, Dept Phys Therapy, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Shalmoni, Nov] Sheba Med Ctr, Multiple Sclerosis Ctr, Tel Hashomer, Israel; [Kalron, Alon] Tel Aviv Univ, Sagol Sch Neurosci, Tel Aviv, Israel";"Kalron, A (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Univ, Sackler Fac Med, Sch Hlth Profess, Dept Phys Therapy, Tel Aviv, Israel.; Kalron, A (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Univ, Sagol Sch Neurosci, Tel Aviv, Israel.";alonkalr@post.tau.ac.il;;;;;;31;1;1;1;7;SPRINGER WIEN;WIEN;SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA;0300-9564;1435-1463;;J NEURAL TRANSM;J.

Objectives: We investigated whether sensor-based gait analysis is able to detect gait impairments in patients with MS (PwMS). Methods: A foot-worn sensor-based gait analysis system was used in 102 PwMS and 22 healthy controls (HC) that were asked to perform the 25-foot walking test (25FWT) two times in a self-selected speed (25FWT_pref), followed by two times in a speed as fast as possible (25FWT_fast). The Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS-12) was used as a subjective measure of patient mobility. Patients were divided into EDSS and functional system subgroups. Results: Datasets between two consecutive measurements (test-retest-reliability) were highly correlated in all analysed mean gait parameters (e.g. 25FWT_fast: stride length r = 0.955, gait speed r = 0.969) Subgroup analysis between HC and PwMS with lower (EDSS <= 3.5) and higher (EDSS 4.0-7.0) disability showed significant differences in mean stride length, gait speed, toe off angle, stance time and swing time (e.g. stride length of EDSS subgroups 25FWT_fast p <= 0.001, 25FWT_pref p = 0.003). The differences between EDSS subgroups were more pronounced in fast than in self-selected gait speed (e.g. stride length 25FWT_fast 33.6 cm vs. 25FWT_pref 16.3 cm). Stride length (25FWT_fast) highly correlated to EDSS (r=-0.583) and MSWS-12 (r=-0.668). We observed significant differences between HC and PwMS with (FS 0-1) and without (FS >= 2) pyramidal or cerebellar disability (e.g. gait speed of FS subgroups p <= 0.001). Conclusion: Sensor-based gait analysis objectively supports the clinical assessment of gait abnormalities even in the lower stages of MS, especially when walking with fast speed. Stride length and gait speed where identified as the most clinically relevant gait measures. Thus, it may be used to support the assessment of PwMS with gait impairment in the future, e.g. for more objective classification of disability. Its role in home-monitoring scenarios need to be evaluated in further studies.;"[Flachenecker, Felix] Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nurnberg FAU, Dept Neurol, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany; [Gassner, Heiko; Winkler, Juergen; Klucken, Jochen] Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nurnberg FAU, Dept Mol Neurol, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany; [Hannik, Julius] Portabiles HealthCare Technol GmbH, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany; [Lee, De-Hyung; Linker, Ralf A.] Univ Regensburg, Dept Neurol, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany; [Flachenecker, Peter] Neurol Rehabil Ctr Quellenhof, Bad Wildbad, Germany; [Eskofier, Bjoern] Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nurnberg FAU, Machine Learning & Data Analyt Lab, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany; [Klucken, Jochen] Fraunhofer Inst Integrierte Schaltungen, Erlangen, Germany";Klucken, J (corresponding author), Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nurnberg FAU, Dept Mol Neurol, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany.;jochen.klucken@uk-erlangen.de;;;"Emerging Fields Initiative of the Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nurnberg, Germany (EFI Moves) [2 Med 03]; Bavarian State Ministry for Education, Science and the Arts, Munich, Germany; Bavarian Ministry of Economic Affairs and Media, Energy and Technology; MoveIT, an EIT Health innovation project; Mobilise-D (IMI H2020 project)";The study was supported by the Emerging Fields Initiative of the Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nurnberg, Germany (EFI Moves, 2 Med 03), the Bavarian State Ministry for Education, Science and the Arts, Munich, Germany (MotionLab@Home, E|Home-Center), the Bavarian Ministry of Economic Affairs and Media, Energy and Technology (Medical Valley Award 2016, Risk-e-Gait) MoveIT, an EIT Health innovation project, and Mobilise-D (IMI H2020 project).

InertiaLocoGraphy, the quantification of gait with inertial measurement units (IMUs), has been found useful to detect early changes in gait in MS. Still, the potential use of IMUs as a reliable biomarker of disease severity in MS remains unknown. Objective: This systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies aimed to describe IMU protocols used to assess gait in MS patients and calculate the effect sizes of IMU features associated with disease severity scale measures. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, Cochrane Central, EMBASE and grey literature to identify articles published before May 2, 2018 that measured gait in MS patients by using IMUs and correlated IMU parameters with disease severity scale measures. We excluded from the meta-analysis articles that did not provide enough data to evaluate the association between IMU parameters and disease severity scale measures. The study was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews on May 2, 2018 (Registration: CRD42018092651) and the protocol was published in Systematic Reviews on January 8, 2019. Results: We included 36 articles in the systematic review and pooled 12 for the meta-analysis. The risk of bias was moderate, with only 2 articles (none included in the meta-analysis) showing a bias score < 50%. Among protocols tested, 2 were predominant (the Timed Up and Go test and 6-min walk test). Speed, step length and step time with IMUs were significantly correlated with the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score, and speed and step length were significantly correlated with the Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale-12 score. Conclusion: IMU measurement has the potential to increase the sensitivity of clinical and performance tests to identify evolution in gait alteration in MS. Kinematic parameters easily accessible with IMUs, such as speed, step length and step duration, can help follow up disease severity in MS individuals with low to medium EDSS score (1.0-4.5).

Eduardo Cofre; Bruijn, Sjoerd M.; Galea, Mary P.";;;Gait stability at early stages of multiple sclerosis using different data sources;GAIT & POSTURE;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Divergence; Location; Multiple sclerosis; Stability";;Background: People at early stages of multiple sclerosis have subtle balance problems that may affect gait stability. However, differences in methods of determining stability such as sensor type and placements, may lead to different results and affect their interpretation when comparing to controls and other studies. Questions: Do people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) exhibit lower gait stability? Do location and type of data used to calculate stability metrics affect comparisons? Methods: 30 PwMS with no walking impairments as clinically measured and 15 healthy controls walked on a treadmill at 1.2 ms(-1) while 3D acceleration data was obtained from sacrum, shoulder and cervical markers and from an accelerometer placed at the sacrum. The local divergence exponent was calculated for the four data sources. An ANOVA with group (multiple sclerosis and control) and data source as main factors was used to determine the effect of disease, data source and their interaction on stability metrics. Results: PwMS walked with significantly less stability according to all sensors (no interaction). A significant effect of data source on stability was also found, indicating that the local divergence exponent derived from sacrum accelerometer was lower than that derived from the other 3 sensor locations. Significance: PwMS with no evident gait impairments are less stable than healthy controls when walking on a treadmill. Although different data sources can be used to determine MS-related stability deterioration, a consensus about location and data source is needed. The local divergence exponent can be a useful measure of progression of gait instability at early stages of MS.;"[Lizama, L.

Frequently interrupting sedentary time might help to mitigate the associated detrimental health consequences. The purpose of this article was to describe the process followed in the systematic development and implementation of a theory- and home-based sedentary behavior change intervention for people with stroke. The Intervention Mapping protocol was used to design, develop and implement a ST and Up Frequently From Stroke (STUFFS) program aimed at reducing prolonged sedentary behavior after stroke. A qualitative inquiry with people with stroke (n = 13) informed the development of the intervention. The systematic approach followed in the development process including the theoretical basis, content development, and evaluation planning were described. Program reception was assessed using thematic content analysis of exit-interview data (n = 25). The 8-weeks STUFFS intervention is a home-based sedentary behavior change program that provides education about the risks of prolonged sedentary behavior and facilitates behavior change, including the use of motivational tools to empower people with stroke to reduce sedentary behavior. The program was well-received and acceptable to people with stroke (89% satisfaction). This article provides information that furthers knowledge about theory-based strategies to reduce sedentary behavior in the home environment after stroke and facilitates implementation of this type of intervention.;"[Ezeugwu, Victor E.; Manns, Patricia J.] Univ Alberta, Fac Rehabil Med, Dept Phys Therapy, Edmonton, AB T6G 2G4, Canada";Ezeugwu, VE (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Fac Rehabil Med, Dept Phys Therapy, Edmonton, AB T6G 2G4, Canada.;ezeugwu@ualberta.ca;;Ezeugwu, Victor/0000-0002-7528-1228;"Alberta Innovates -Health Solutions [201600292]; Clinical Research Innovation Fund; Physiotherapy Foundation of Canada through the Ann Collins Whitmore Memorial Scholarship; Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital Clinical Research Grant";"The authors thank the clinicians with the stroke unit at the rehabilitation hospital for assistance with recruitment.

Some factors that may cause reduced BMD in PwMS have been understudied, including physical activity, inflammation, cortisol, symptomatic fatigue, and depression. The aim of this study was to investigate factors that may uniquely contribute to reduced BMD in PwMS as compared to people without MS. We hypothesized that physical activity would be the primary determinant of low BMD in PwMS, with additional contributions from inflammation and sympathetic nervous system activation. Methods: We tested 23 PwMS (16 women; median EDSS: 2) and 22 control participants (16 women). BMD was measured from the femoral neck and lumbar spine with dual x-ray absorptiometry. Disability was measured with the Expanded Disability Status Scale, and functional capacity was measured with the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite. Questionnaires measured symptomatic fatigue and depression. A blood draw was used to measure calcium, phosphate, vitamin D, N-terminal telopeptide, osteopontin, and cytokine markers of inflammation. Physical activity was measured with accelerometry. Salivary cortisol and cardiac heart rate variability also were obtained. All outcome variables were compared between groups with independent samples t-tests. Variables that were different between groups and significantly correlated (Pearson product-moment) with femoral neck BMD, were included in a theoretical model to explain femoral neck BMD. The expected direction of relations in the theoretical model were developed based upon the results of previous research. A Bayesian path analysis was used to test the relations of predictive variables with femoral neck BMD and interrelations among predictive variables, as detailed in the theoretical model. Results: PwMS had lower BMD at the femoral neck than controls (p = = 0.04; mean difference: -0.09; 95% CI: -0.2, -0.004; Cohen's d = = 0.65), and there was a smaller, statistically non-significant difference in BMD at the lumbar spine (p = =0.07; mean difference: -0.08; 95% CI: -0.17, 0.007; Cohen's d = = 0.59). PwMS also had lower functional capacity (p <= 0.001; Cohen's d = =1.50), greater fatigue (p <0.001; Cohen's d = =1.88), greater depression (p <0.001; d = =1.31), and decreased physical activity (p = = 0.03; Cohen's d = = 0.62). Using path analysis to test our theoretical model, we found that disability (standardized estimate = -0.17), physical activity (standardized estimate = 0.39), symptomatic fatigue (standardized estimate = -0.36), depression (standardized estimate = -0.30), and inflammatory markers (standardized estimate = 0.27) explained 51% of the variance in femoral neck BMD. Inflammatory markers were also predictive of disability (standardized estimate = 0.44) and physical activity (standardized estimate = -0.40). Symptomatic fatigue and depression were correlated (r = = 0.64). Conclusion: Physical activity, symptomatic fatigue, depression, disability, and inflammation all contributed in- dependently to decreased femoral neck BMD in PWMS. Bone metabolism in PwMS is complex. Efforts to increase physical activity and address symptomatic fatigue and depression may improve bone mineral density in PwMS. Future research should investigate the mechanisms through which symptomatic fatigue and depression contribute to reduced BMD in PwMS.";"[Cleland, Brice T.; Papanek, Paula; Ingraham, Benjamin A.; Harkins, April; Garnier-Villarreal, Mauricio; Ng, Alexander V.] Marquette Univ, Milwaukee, WI 53233 USA; [Woo, Douglas; Csuka, M.

The ALICE platform includes a robotics wearable exoskeleton and an on-board muscle driven simulator to estimate the user's kinetic parameters. Background: Even when the kinematics patterns of the human gait are well studied and reported in the literature, there exists a considerable intra-subject variability in the kinetics of the movements. ALICE aims to be an advanced mechanical sensor that allows us to compute real-time information of both kinetic and kinematic data, opening up a new personalized rehabilitation concept. Methodology: We developed a full muscle driven simulator in an open source environment and validated it with real gait data obtained from patients diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. After that, we designed, modeled, and controlled a 6 DoF lower limb exoskeleton with inertial measurement units and a position/velocity sensor in each actuator. Significance: This novel concept aims to become a tool for improving the diagnosis of pathological gait and to design personalized robotics rehabilitation therapies.

In this paper, we focus on the estimation of the step length using machine learning techniques that could be used in an indoor positioning system. Previous step length algorithms tried to model the length of a step based on measurements from the accelerometer and some tuneable (user-specific) parameters. Machine-learning-based step length estimation algorithms eliminate these parameters to be tuned. Instead, to adapt these algorithms to different users, it suffices to provide examples of the length of multiple steps for different persons to the machine learning algorithm, so that in the training phase the algorithm can learn to predict the step length for different users. Until now, these machine learning algorithms were trained with features that were chosen intuitively. In this paper, we consider a systematic feature selection algorithm to be able to determine the features from a large collection of features, resulting in the best performance. This resulted in a step length estimator with a mean absolute error of 3.48 cm for a known test person and 4.19 cm for an unknown test person, while current state-of-the-art machine-learning-based step length estimators resulted in a mean absolute error of 4.94 cm and 6.27 cm for respectively a known and unknown test person.;"[Vandermeeren, Stef; Bruneel, Herwig; Steendam, Heidi] Univ Ghent, Dept Telecommun & Informat Proc IMEC, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium";Vandermeeren, S (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Dept Telecommun & Informat Proc IMEC, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.;"stef.vandermeeren@ugent.be; herwig.bruneel@ugent.be; Heidi.Steendam@UGent.be";;;"Belgian Research Council FWO [30452698]; Belgian Research Council FNRSFonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS [30452698]";This research was funded by the EOS grant 30452698 from the Belgian Research Councils FWO and FNRS.;;16;1;2;0;4;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;1424-8220;;SENSORS-BASEL;Sensors;FEB;2020;20;3;;;;;;;778;10.3390/s20030778;;;17;"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation";"Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation";KR7HH;WOS:000517786200202;32023938;DOAJ Gold, Green Published;;;2021-03-18;

Methods: twenty-three subjects with CP and 23 controls, aged between 4 and 14 years, were evaluated on two occasions, separated by 3 to 5 days. An IMU and a Cervical Range of Motion device (CROM) were used to assess craniocervical ROM in the three spatial planes. Validity was assessed by comparing IMU and CROM data using the Pearson correlation coefficient, the paired t-test and Bland-Altman plots. Intra-day and inter-day relative reliability were determined using the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC). The Standard Error of Measurement (SEM) and the Minimum Detectable Change at a 90% confidence level (MDC90) were obtained for absolute reliability. Results: High correlations were detected between methods in both groups on the sagittal and frontal planes (r > 0.9), although this was reduced in the case of the transverse plane. Bland-Altman plots indicated bias below 5 degrees, although for the range of cervical rotation in the CP group, this was 8.2 degrees. The distance between the limits of agreement was over 23.5 degrees in both groups, except for the range of flexion-extension in the control group. ICCs were higher than 0.8 for both comparisons and groups, except for inter-day comparisons of rotational range in the CP group. Absolute reliability showed high variability, with most SEM below 8.5 degrees, although with worse inter-day results, mainly in CP subjects, with the MDC90 of rotational range achieving more than 20 degrees. Conclusions: IMU application is highly correlated with CROM for the assessment of craniocervical movement in CP and healthy subjects; however, both methods are not interchangeable. The IMU error of measurement can be considered clinically acceptable; however, caution should be taken when this is used as a reference measure for interventions.";"[Carmona-Perez, Cristina] Ctr Recuperac Neurol Cordoba CEDANE, Cordoba 14005, Spain; [Carmona-Perez, Cristina; Alcaraz-Clariana, Sandra; Garcia-Luque, Lourdes] Univ Cordoba, Doctoral Program Biomed, E-14004 Cordoba, Spain; [Luis Garrido-Castro, Juan; Torres Vidal, Francisco] Univ Cordoba, Dept Comp Sci & Numer Anal, Rabanales Campus, E-14071 Cordoba, Spain; [Luis Garrido-Castro, Juan; Alburquerque-Sendin, Francisco] Maimonides Biomed Res Inst Cordoba IMIBIC, Cordoba 14004, Spain; [Alcaraz-Clariana, Sandra; Alburquerque-Sendin, Francisco; Priscila Rodrigues-de-Souza, Daiana] Univ Cordoba, Fac Med & Nursing, Physiotherapy Sect, E-14004 Cordoba, Spain";"Alburquerque-Sendin, F (corresponding author), Maimonides Biomed Res Inst Cordoba IMIBIC, Cordoba 14004, Spain.; Alburquerque-Sendin, F (corresponding author), Univ Cordoba, Fac Med & Nursing, Physiotherapy Sect, E-14004 Cordoba, Spain.";"mcarperes@yahoo.es; cc0juanl@uco.es; frantorresvidal@gmail.com; m72alcls@uco.es; lgarcial05@hotmail.com; falburquerque@uco.es; drodrigues@uco.es";"Alburquerque-Sendin, Francisco/L-1539-2016; Garrido-Castro, Juan L./AAZ-7453-2020";"Alburquerque-Sendin, Francisco/0000-0002-3892-8440; Garrido-Castro, Juan L./0000-0002-0871-3780; Rodrigues-de-Souza, Daiana Priscila/0000-0002-3651-3276; Garcia-Luque, Lourdes/0000-0002-1735-5946; ALCARAZ, SANDRA/0000-0002-4138-9142";Consejeria de Salud (Andalusian Government, Spain) [PI-0324-2017, PIN-0079-2016];"This research was funded by Consejeria de Salud (Andalusian Government, Spain), grants PI-0324-2017 and PIN-0079-2016.

Part of the known MS biomarkers are discovered in cerebrospinal fluid like oligoclonal lgG (OCGB), and also in blood like myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein (MOG). The conventional MS diagnostic methods often fail to detect the disease in early stages such as Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS), which considered as a concerning issue since CIS highlighted as a prognostic factor of MS development in most cases. Methods: MS diagnostic techniques include Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the brain and spinal cord, lumbar puncture (or spinal tap) that evaluate cerebrospinal fluid, evoked potential testing revealing abnormalities in the brain and spinal cord. These conventional diagnostic methods have some negative points such as extensive processing time as well as restriction in the quantity of samples that can be analyzed concurrently. Scientists have focused on developing the detection methods especially early detection which belongs to ultra-sensitive, non-invasive and needed for the Point of Care (POC) diagnosis because the situation was complicated by false positive or negative results. Results: As a result, biosensors are utilized and investigated since they could be ultra-sensitive to specific compounds, cost effective devices, body-friendly and easy to implement. In addition, it has been proved that the biosensors on physiological fluids (blood, serum, urine, saliva, milk etc.) have quick response in a non-invasive rout. In general form, a biosensor system for diagnosis and early detection process usually involves; biomarker (target molecule), bio receptor (recognition element) and compatible bio transducer. Conclusion: Studies underlined that early treatment of patients with high possibility of MS can be advantageous by postponing further abnormalities on MRI and subsequent attacks. This Review highlights variable disease diagnosis approaches such as Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR), electrochemical biosensors, Microarrays and microbeads based Microarrays, which are considered as promising methods for detection and early detection of MS.";"[Kharati, Maryam; Foroutanparsa, Sanam; Rabiee, Mohammad.] Amirkabir Univ Technol, Fac Biomed Engn, Biomat Grp, Tehran, Iran; [Salarian, Reza] Maziar Univ, Biomed Engn Dept, Noor, Royan, Iran; [Rabiee, Navid.; Rabiee, Ghazal] Shahid Beheshti Univ, Dept Chem, Tehran, Iran";Rabiee, M (corresponding author), Amirkabir Univ Technol, Fac Biomed Engn, Biomat Grp, Tehran, Iran.;mrabiee@aut.ac.ir;Rabiee, Navid/K-4407-2019;Rabiee, Navid/0000-0002-6945-8541;;;;136;5;5;7;7;BENTHAM SCIENCE PUBL LTD;SHARJAH;EXECUTIVE STE Y-2, PO BOX 7917, SAIF ZONE, 1200 BR SHARJAH, U ARAB EMIRATES;1573-4110;1875-6727;;CURR ANAL CHEM;Curr.

Physical therapists provide interventions to improve patient's functional outcomes, yet balance and gait are often evaluated in a subjective and observational manner. The use of quantitative methods allows for assessment and tracking of patient progress during and after rehabilitation or for early diagnosis of movement disorders. This paper surveys the state-of-the-art in wearable sensor technology in gait, balance, and range of motion research. It serves as a point of reference for future research, describing current solutions and challenges in the field.

Nonetheless, it is not clear how IMU-based metrics might be influenced by pragmatic aspects associated with clinical translation of this approach, such as data collection settings and gait protocols. In this study, we hypothesised that these aspects do not significantly alter those characteristics of gait that are more related to quality and energetic efficiency and are quantifiable via acceleration related metrics, such as intensity, smoothness, stability, symmetry, and regularity. To test this hypothesis, we compared 33 IMU-based metrics extracted from data, retrospectively collected by two independent centres on two matched cohorts of pwMS. As a worst-case scenario, a walking test was performed in the two centres at a different speed along corridors of different lengths, using different IMU systems, which were also positioned differently. The results showed that the majority of the temporal metrics (9 out of 12) exhibited significant between-centre differences. Conversely, the between-centre differences in the gait quality metrics were small and comparable to those associated with a test-retest analysis under equivalent conditions. Therefore, the gait quality metrics are promising candidates for reliable multi-centric studies aiming at assessing rehabilitation interventions within a routine clinical context.;"[Angelini, Lorenza; Mazza, Claudia] Univ Sheffield, Dept Mech Engn, Sheffield S1 3JD, S Yorkshire, England; [Angelini, Lorenza; Nair, Krishnan Padmakumari Sivaraman; Mazza, Claudia] Univ Sheffield, Insigneo Inst Silico Med, Sheffield S1 3JD, S Yorkshire, England; [Carpinella, Ilaria; Cattaneo, Davide; Ferrarin, Maurizio; Gervasoni, Elisa] IRCCS Fdn Don Carlo Gnocchi, I-20121 Milan, Italy; [Sharrack, Basil; Nair, Krishnan Padmakumari Sivaraman] Sheffield Teaching Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, Acad Dept Neurosci, Sheffield NIHR Neurosci BRC, Sheffield S10 2JF, S Yorkshire, England; [Paling, David] Sheffield Teaching Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, Sheffield Inst Translat Neurosci, Sheffield S10 2JF, S Yorkshire, England";"Angelini, L (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Dept Mech Engn, Sheffield S1 3JD, S Yorkshire, England.; Angelini, L (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Insigneo Inst Silico Med, Sheffield S1 3JD, S Yorkshire, England.";"L.Angelini@sheffield.ac.uk; icarpinella@dongnocchi.it; dcattaneo@dongnocchi.it; mferrarin@dongnocchi.it; egervasoni@dongnocchi.it; basil.sharrack@nhs.net; david.paling@nhs.net; siva.nair@nhs.net; c.mazza@sheffield.ac.uk";"Nair, Krishnan/AAE-3474-2020; Ferrarin, Maurizio/I-3230-2012; Carpinella, Ilaria/K-1572-2016";"Nair, Krishnan/0000-0002-4004-2315; Ferrarin, Maurizio/0000-0002-7797-2399; Carpinella, Ilaria/0000-0001-7486-0706; Angelini, Lorenza/0000-0002-4763-7717; Mazza, Claudia/0000-0002-5215-1746";"NIHR through the Sheffield Biomedical Research Centre (BRC) [IS-BRC-1215-20017]; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme; EFPIA via the Innovative Medicine Initiative 2 (Mobilise-D project) [IMI22017-13-7-820820]; UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (Multisim and MultiSim2 project)UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/K03877X/1, EP/S032940/1]; Italian Ministry of Health, Ricerca CorrenteMinistry of Health, Italy [GR-2009-1604984]";This study was co-funded by the NIHR through the Sheffield Biomedical Research Centre (BRC, grant number IS-BRC-1215-20017), by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme and EFPIA via the Innovative Medicine Initiative 2 (Mobilise-D project, grant number IMI22017-13-7-820820), the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (Multisim and MultiSim2 project, grant number EP/K03877X/1 and EP/S032940/1), and by the Italian Ministry of Health, Ricerca Corrente (grant number GR-2009-1604984).

Participants with MS (N = 253) wore an accelerometer for a 7-day period and completed the Cambridge-Hopkins Restless Legs Syndrome Questionnaire, the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group Scale (IRLS), and the Patient Determined Disease Steps scale. Sixty-six (26%) persons with MS had RLS (MS + RLS). There were no differences between the MS + RLS and MS group for parameters of physical activity or sedentary behavior. Among participants with IRLS scores in the mild range (n = 26), more time spent in light physical activity (r(s) = -0.39), fewer sedentary bouts per day (r(s) = 0.55), less time in sedentary bouts per day (r(s) = 0.51), and fewer breaks in sedentary time per day (r(s) = 0.57) were associated with lower RLS severity. This study represents the first step toward recognizing a relationship between physical activity, patterns of sedentary behavior, and RLS severity in MS and these results suggest that light physical activity and the pattern of sedentary behavior may be important targets for prospective behavioral interventions that target the management of RLS in persons with MS who have mild RLS severity.;"[Cederberg, Katie L.

Real-time monitoring of SMEnzyme is also crucial as an important biomarker for several other diseases like atherosclerosis, multiple sclerosis, and HIV. In this study, we present an electrochemical method to detect SMEnzyme concentration that is more sensitive and much faster than currently available commercial assays. For detection and the amplification of the SMEnzyme signal, methylene blue (MB)-encapsulated sphingomyelin (SM)-based liposome with 50% cholesterol was synthesized via sonication method. Then the target SMEnzyme causes the free release of the MB from the MB-liposome formulation which can be detected on GCE parallel to Au-PAni/N,S-GQDs electrode, prepared via interfacial polymerization and then self-assembly approach. The change of SM to gel state bilayer with increasing concentration of ceramide accounts for the observed increase in membrane permeability and consequent release of encapsulated MB as the redox indicator for electrochemical Differential Pulse Voltammetric (DPV) analysis. To get the optimum capture through pi-pi stacking interaction of the released MB on the Au-PAni/N,S-GQDs nanocomposites, which has been used as working electrode. Minimal cross-reactivity with similar phospholipase and proteins confirms the stable and non-leaky MB-liposome platform with low background signal and high specificity toward SMEnzyme. Additionally, the applicability of the proposed sensor has successfully verified in three possible sources of human serum, plasma and cell supernatant without compromising its performance. Taken together, the simplicity, rapid response time and high sensitivity of this present method offer huge potential in point-of-care diagnostics of SMEnzyme detection.;"[Dutt, Chowdhury Ankan; Park, Enoch Y.] Shizuoka Univ, Res Inst Green Sci & Technol, Suruga Ku, 836 Ohya, Shizuoka 4228529, Japan; [Park, Enoch Y.] Shizuoka Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Technol, Dept Biosci, Suruga Ku, 836 Ohya, Shizuoka 4228529, Japan";Park, EY (corresponding author), Shizuoka Univ, Res Inst Green Sci & Technol, Suruga Ku, 836 Ohya, Shizuoka 4228529, Japan.;"ankan.dutta.chowdhury@shizuoka.ac.jp; park.enoch@shizuoka.ac.jp";Park, Enoch/AAU-2614-2020;Park, Enoch Y./0000-0002-7840-1424;Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [P17359];A.D.C. sincerely thanks the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) for a postdoctoral fellowship (Grant Nos.

Here, we studied multiple sclerosis (MS) as a model neurological disease for investigating physiometric and environmental signals. The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility and correlation of wearable biosensors with traditional clinical measures of disability both in clinic and in free-living in MS patients. This is a single site observational cohort study conducted at an academic neurological center specializing in MS. A cohort of 25 MS patients with varying disability scores were recruited. Patients were monitored in clinic while wearing biosensors at nine body locations at three separate visits. Biosensor-derived features including aspects of gait (stance time, turn angle, mean turn velocity) and balance were collected, along with standardized disability scores assessed by a neurologist. Participants also wore up to three sensors on the wrist, ankle, and sternum for 8 weeks as they went about their daily lives. The primary outcomes were feasibility, adherence, as well as correlation of biosensor-derived metrics with traditional neurologist-assessed clinical measures of disability. We used machine-learning algorithms to extract multiple features of motion and dexterity and correlated these measures with more traditional measures of neurological disability, including the expanded disability status scale (EDSS) and the MS functional composite-4 (MSFC-4). In free-living, sleep measures were additionally collected. Twenty-three subjects completed the first two of three in-clinic study visits and the 8-week free-living biosensor period. Several biosensor-derived features significantly correlated with EDSS and MSFC-4 scores derived at visit two, including mobility stance time with MSFC-4 z-score (Spearman correlation -0.546; p= 0.0070), several aspects of turning including turn angle (0.437; p = 0.0372), and maximum angular velocity (0.653; p = 0.0007). Similar correlations were observed at subsequent clinic visits, and in the free-living setting. We also found other passively collected signals, including measures of sleep, that correlated with disease severity. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of applying passive biosensor measurement techniques to monitor disability in MS patients both in clinic and in the free-living setting.";"[Chitnis, Tanuja; Glanz, Bonnie I.; Gonzalez, Cindy; Healy, Brian C.; Saraceno, Taylor J.; Sattarnezhad, Neda; Diaz-Cruz, Camilo; Polgar-Turcsanyi, Mariann; Tummala, Subhash; Bakshi, Rohit; Weiner, Howard L.] Harvard Med Sch, Dept Neurol, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Ann Romney Ctr Neurol Dis, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Chitnis, Tanuja; Glanz, Bonnie I.; Gonzalez, Cindy; Healy, Brian C.; Saraceno, Taylor J.; Sattarnezhad, Neda; Diaz-Cruz, Camilo; Polgar-Turcsanyi, Mariann; Tummala, Subhash; Bakshi, Rohit; Weiner, Howard L.] Harvard Med Sch, Dept Neurol, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Partners Multiple Sclerosis Ctr, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Bajaj, Vikram S.; Ben-Shimol, David; Bikhchandani, Nikhil; Blocker, Alexander W.; Burkart, Joshua; Cendrillon, Raphael; Cusack, Michael P.; Demiralp, Emre; Jooste, Sarel Kobus; Kharbouch, Alaa; Lee, Amy A.; Lehar, Joseph; Liu, Manway; Mahadevan, Swaminathan; Murphy, Mark; Norton, Linda C.; Parlikar, Tushar A.; Pathak, Anupam; Shoeb, Ali; Soderberg, Erin; Stephens, Philip; Stoertz, Aaron H.; Thng, Florence; Tumkur, Kashyap; Wang, Hongsheng; Marks, William J.; Snyder, Thomas M.] Verily Life Sci, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Rhodes, Jane; Rudick, Richard A.; Ransohoff, Richard M.; Phillips, Glenn A.; Bruzik, Effie] Biogen, Boston, MA USA";"Chitnis, T (corresponding author), Harvard Med Sch, Dept Neurol, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Ann Romney Ctr Neurol Dis, Boston, MA 02115 USA.; Chitnis, T (corresponding author), Harvard Med Sch, Dept Neurol, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Partners Multiple Sclerosis Ctr, Boston, MA 02115 USA.; Snyder, TM (corresponding author), Verily Life Sci, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA.";"tchitnis@rics.bwh.harvard.edu; tmsnyder@verily.com";;"Chitnis, Tanuja/0000-0002-9897-4422; Bakshi, Rohit/0000-0001-8601-5534";"BiogenBiogen; Verily Life Sciences";The authors wish to thank the patients who participated in this study, as well as the Partners MS Center study staff.

However, instrumental assessment is needed to provide quantitative measures. Objective: To develop and validate an instrumented version of the mDGI. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Clinical setting. Participants: Thirty adults with neurologic disorders (10 with multiple sclerosis, 10 with Parkinson disease, and 10 with stroke) and 20 healthy volunteers. Methods: Participants were assessed with the Timed Up and Go test (TUG) and with the mDGI. During the assessment of mDGI, data were collected by a single Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) positioned on the sternum. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the instrumented data extracting eight PC scores (ImPC) describing dynamic balance. The instrumented overall score (ImDGI) was then calculated as the sum of the mPCs. PCA revealed two components associated with stride features and regularity (ImDGI_Gait_Pattern) and trunk movements (ImDGI_Trunk_Sway). Spearman coefficients were calculated between mDGI and ImDGI, whereas Mann-Whitney (U) and Kruskal-Wallis (H) tests assessed differences between groups and neurologic conditions. Main Outcome Measurements: ImDGI. Results: ImDGI did not show ceiling effects, and good correlations were found between ImDGI and mDGI (r = .84), and TUG (r = .84) for people with neurologic disorders (P < .001). Significant differences among pathologies (H test((2)) = 12.5, P = .002) and between healthy participants and adults with neurologic disorders (U test = 47.0, P = .001) were found.

There are a wide range of symptoms, with fatigue reported as one of the most troublesome. MS Energize-or MS Energise in UK English regions-is an iPhone app focused on self-management of fatigue for people with MS. Based on cognitive-behavioral therapy principles, the app covers MS fatigue, how to use energy effectively, how behavior, thoughts and emotions interact and impact on MS fatigue, as well as the potential effects of bodily and environmental factors. MS Energize provides education, interactive tasks, and supports application of the principles into a user's day-to-day life. We field tested the usability and perceived usefulness of MS Energize with 11 people with longstanding multiple sclerosis in New Zealand and the United Kingdom. Participants used the app over a period of five to six weeks after which they rated the usability of the app and participated in an in-depth qualitative interview. We developed four main themes through our thematic analysis. 1. Validation of participants' own experiences of living with MS fatigue. 2. The personal cost in engaging with such an intervention. 3. Reframing experiences and adding to knowledge. 4. That the app was generally a good idea. Field testers' feedback also identified usability issues that could be addressed. In particular, the amount of text-based content in the app contributed to the app itself being fatiguing. This field-testing process has highlighted the value of the app while also guiding our roadmap for further developments to enhance usability and usefulness. The next step is further refinement of components of MS Energize in preparation for a trial of its clinical and cost effectiveness.;"[Babbage, Duncan R.; Drown, Juliet] Auckland Univ Technol, Ctr eHlth, Auckland, New Zealand; [Babbage, Duncan R.; Sezier, Ann] Auckland Univ Technol, Ctr Person Ctr Res, Auckland, New Zealand; [van Kessel, Kirsten] Auckland Univ Technol, Sch Publ Hlth & Psychosocial Studies, Auckland, New Zealand; [Thomas, Sarah; Thomas, Peter] Bournemouth Univ, Clin Res Unit, Poole, Dorset, England; [Kersten, Paula] Univ Brighton, Sch Hlth Sci, Brighton, E Sussex, England";van Kessel, K (corresponding author), Auckland Univ Technol, Private Bag 92006, Auckland 1142, New Zealand.;Kirsten.VanKessel@aut.ac.nz;;;"Auckland University of Technology, New Zealand; AUT Ventures, New Zealand; Kiwinet, New Zealand; Bournemouth University, United Kingdom";"This research was supported by funding from Auckland University of Technology, New Zealand;AUT Ventures, New Zealand; Kiwinet, New Zealand; Bournemouth University, United Kingdom.";;37;1;1;0;2;ELSEVIER;AMSTERDAM;RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;;2214-7829;;INTERNET INTERV;Internet Interv.;DEC;2019;18;;;;;;;;100291;10.1016/j.invent.2019.100291;;;9;"Psychology, Clinical; Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics; Psychiatry";"Psychology; Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics; Psychiatry";JT3UE;WOS:000500917500035;31890637;DOAJ Gold, Green Published, Green Accepted;;;2021-03-18;

We aimed to determine which gait features become worse during sustained walking and to examine the clinical correlates of gait fatigability in pwMS. Fifty-eight pwMS performed the 6-min walk test while wearing body-fixed sensors. Multiple gait domains (e.g., pace, rhythm, variability, asymmetry and complexity) were compared across each minute of the test and between mild- and moderate-disability patient groups. Associations between the decline in gait performance (i.e., gait fatigability) and patient-reported gait disability, fatigue and falls were also determined. Cadence, stride time variability, stride regularity, step regularity and gait complexity significantly deteriorated during the test. In contrast, somewhat surprisingly, gait speed and swing time asymmetry did not change. As expected, subjects with moderate disability (n = 24) walked more poorly in most gait domains compared to the mild-disability group (n = 34). Interestingly, a group x fatigue interaction effect was observed for cadence and gait complexity; these measures decreased over time in the moderate-disability group, but not in the mild group. Gait fatigability rate was significantly correlated with physical fatigue, gait disability, and fall history. These findings suggest that sustained walking affects specific aspects of gait, which can be used as markers for fatigability in MS. This effect on gait depends on the degree of disability, and may increase fall risk in pwMS. To more fully understand and monitor correlates that reflect everyday walking in pwMS, multiple domains of gait should be quantified.";"[Shema-Shiratzky, S.; Gazit, E.; Herman, T.; Mirelman, A.; Hausdorff, Jeffrey M.] Tel Aviv Sourasky Med Ctr, Ctr Study Movement Cognit & Mobil, 6 Weizmann St, IL-6423906 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Sun, R.; Sosnoff, J.

In it, workers are challenged almost every day by highly demanding physical tasks. Although current methods [e.g., the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)] to investigate the physical demands of various tasks provide valuable information with which to evaluate certain manual handling tasks, they may be limited to consideration of unique characteristics of each individual (e.g., physiological characteristics) and environmental conditions (e.g., ambient temperature and humidity). In other words, given the same task, different workers experience different levels of exertion. To address this problem, the objective of this research is to develop a procedure for automatic predictions of demand levels based on physiological signals collected from workers. To achieve the objective, workers' physiological signals were captured using a wristband-type biosensor while they performed regular tasks in the field. Various physiological responses were extracted from the artifact-corrected physiological signals. The rate of energy expenditure, estimated using an energy-expenditure prediction program (EEPP), was used as a baseline to separate tasks into low-, moderate-, and high-intensity activities. Then, a supervised-machine-learning model was trained by applying a Gaussian kernel support vector machine. The results led to a prediction accuracy of 90% in recognizing low and high physical-intensity levels and 87% for low, moderate, and high physical-intensity levels. The main contribution to the body of knowledge is the development of an automatic and noninvasive method for assessing workers' physical demands in the field. This study will contribute to improving construction workers' productivity, safety, and general well-being through the early detection of highly physically demanding tasks in the field.;"[Jebelli, Houtan] Penn State Univ, Dept Architectural Engn, 224 Engn Unit A, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Choi, Byungjoo] Southern Illinois Univ Edwardsville, Dept Construct, Engn Bldg 3075,61 Circle Dr, Edwardsville, IL 62025 USA; [Lee, SangHyun] Univ Michigan, Tishman Construct Management Program, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 2350 Hayward St,Suite 2340 GG Brown Bldg, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA";Lee, S (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Tishman Construct Management Program, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 2350 Hayward St,Suite 2340 GG Brown Bldg, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.;"hjebelli@psu.edu; bchoi@siue.edu; shdpm@umich.edu";Choi, Byungjoo/H-9576-2016;"Choi, Byungjoo/0000-0002-3904-4305; Lee, SangHyun/0000-0002-2246-7440";;;;140;8;8;13;51;ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS;RESTON;1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA;0733-9364;1943-7862;;J CONSTR ENG M;J.

The aim of this systematic literature review is to analyze the wearable systems for monitoring shoulder kinematics and their applicability in clinical settings and rehabilitation. Methods A comprehensive search of PubMed, Medline, Google Scholar and IEEE Xplore was performed and results were included up to July 2019. All studies concerning wearable sensors to assess shoulder kinematics were retrieved. Results Seventy-three studies were included because they have fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The results showed that magneto and/or inertial sensors are the most used. Wearable sensors measuring upper limb and/or shoulder kinematics have been proposed to be applied in patients with different pathological conditions such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, osteoarthritis, rotator cuff tear. Sensors placement and method of attachment were broadly heterogeneous among the examined studies. Conclusions Wearable systems are a promising solution to provide quantitative and meaningful clinical information about progress in a rehabilitation pathway and to extrapolate meaningful parameters in the diagnosis of shoulder pathologies. There is a strong need for development of this novel technologies which undeniably serves in shoulder evaluation and therapy.;"[Carnevale, Arianna; Longo, Umile Giuseppe; Berton, Alessandra; Candela, Vincenzo; Denaro, Vincenzo] Campus Biomed Univ, Dept Orthopaed & Trauma Surg, Via Alvaro del Portillo 200, I-00128 Rome, Italy; [Schena, Emiliano; Massaroni, Carlo; Lo Presti, Daniela] Campus Biomed Univ, Unit Measurements & Biomed Instrumentat, Via Alvaro del Portillo 21, I-00128 Rome, Italy";Longo, UG (corresponding author), Campus Biomed Univ, Dept Orthopaed & Trauma Surg, Via Alvaro del Portillo 200, I-00128 Rome, Italy.;g.longo@unicampus.it;Longo, Umile Giuseppe/K-9147-2016;Longo, Umile Giuseppe/0000-0003-4063-9821;Italian Ministry of HealthMinistry of Health, Italy [PE-2016-02364894];This work has been funded by the Italian Ministry of Health in the framework of RICERCA FINALIZZATA 2016 (PE-2016-02364894).;;102;12;12;0;8;BMC;LONDON;CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND;;1471-2474;;BMC MUSCULOSKEL DIS;BMC Musculoskelet.

The cell-based assay with a sensitivity of 76% and specificity of 100% is the most recommended test to detect anti-aquaporin-4 antibodies (AQP4-Ab). Here, we tested four AQP4 external loop peptides (AQP4(61-70), AQP4(131-140), AQP4(141-150), and AQP4(201-210)) with an atomic force microscopy nanoimmunosensor to develop a diagnostic assay. We obtained the highest reactivity with AQP4(61-70)-nanoimunosensor. This assay was effective in detecting AQP4-Ab in sera of NMOSD patients with 100% specificity (95% CI 63.06-100), determined by the cut-off adhesion force value of 241.3 pN. NMOSD patients were successfully discriminated from a set of healthy volunteers, patients with multiple sclerosis, and AQP4-Ab-negative patients. AQP4(61-70) sensitivity was 81.25% (95% CI 56.50-99.43), slightly higher than with the CBA method. The results with the AQP4(61-70)-nanoimmunosensor indicate that the differences between NMOSD seropositive and seronegative phenotypes are related to disease-specific epitopes. The absence of AQP4-Ab in sera of NMOSD AQP4-Ab-negative patients may be interpreted by assuming the existence of another potential AQP4 peptide sequence or non-AQP4 antigens as the antibody target.;"[Moraes, Ariana de Souza; Magalhaes Ierich, Jessica Cristiane; Higa, Akemi Martins] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Trop Med Sao Paulo, BR-05403000 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Moraes, Ariana de Souza; Magalhaes Ierich, Jessica Cristiane; Higa, Akemi Martins; Jabur Assis, Amanda Stefanie; Miyazaki, Celina Massumi; Ferreira, Marystela; Leite, Fabio Lima] Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Dept Phys Chem & Math, BR-18052780 Sorocaba, SP, Brazil; [Moraes, Ariana de Souza; Brum, Doralina Guimaraes; Magalhaes Ierich, Jessica Cristiane; Higa, Akemi Martins; Jabur Assis, Amanda Stefanie; Leite, Fabio Lima] Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Nanoneurobiophys Res Grp GNN, BR-18052780 Sorocaba, SP, Brazil; [Brum, Doralina Guimaraes] Sao Paulo State Univ, Dept Neurol Psychol & Psychiat, BR-18618687 Botucatu, SP, Brazil; [Shimizu, Flavio Makoto; Oliveira Jr, Osvaldo N.] Univ Sao Paulo, Sao Carlos Inst Phys, BR-13560970 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil; [Peroni, Luis Antonio] Rheabiotech Lab Res & Dev, Campinas, SP, Brazil; [Machini, M.

This approach is motivated by the goal of diagnosing gait abnormalities on a symptom-by-symptom basis, irrespective of other neuromuscular movement disorders the patients may be affected by. This could lead to improvements in treatment and offer a greater insight into movement disorders. Methods: In-shoe pressure was measured for 12 able-bodied participants, each subject to eight artificially induced gait alterations, achieved by modifying the underside of the shoe. The data were recorded at 100 Hz over 2520 data channels and were analyzed using the deep learning architecture and the long term short term memory networks. Additionally, the rationale for the decision-making process of these networks was investigated. Conclusion: Long term short term memory networks are applicable to the classification of the gait function. The classifications can be made using only 2 s of sparse data (82.0% accuracy over 96 000 instances of test data) from participants who were not a part of the training set. Significance: This paper provides potential for the gait function to be accurately classified using non-invasive techniques, and at more regular intervals, outside of a clinical setting, without the need for healthcare professionals to be present.;"[Turner, Alexander] Univ Hull, Dept Comp Sci & Technol, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England; [Hayes, Stephen] Univ Hull, Dept Sport Hlth & Exercise, Kingston Upon Hull, N Humberside, England";Turner, A (corresponding author), Univ Hull, Dept Comp Sci & Technol, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England.;alexander.turner@hull.ac.uk;;Hayes, Stephen/0000-0003-0767-3657;;;;55;5;6;1;11;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;0018-9294;1558-2531;;IEEE T BIO-MED ENG;IEEE Trans.

Design: A single-blinded, randomized controlled trial. Participants were randomized to contact-control intervention (CC), physical activity-only intervention (PA-only), and physical activity plus fatigue self-management intervention (FM+). Outcomes were measured at baseline (2wk prerandomization), posttest (14wk postrandomization), and follow-up (26wk postrandomization). Setting: Telephone-delivered in Midwest and Northeast regions of the United States. Participants: Inactive adults with MS (N=208) and moderate-to-severe fatigue. Interventions: Three or 6 group teleconferences followed by 4 individually tailored phone calls delivered during 12 weeks. An occupational therapist and research assistant delivered the teleconferences and tailored phone calls, respectively. Main Outcome Measures: Primary outcomes were self-report fatigue and physical activity measured with the Fatigue Impact Scale and Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire, respectively. Secondary outcomes included quality of life measured with the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale and moderate-to-vigorous exercise and step count measured with an accelerometer. Results: Linear mixed effects models showed FM+ significantly improved self-reported fatigue (beta=-11.08; P=.03) and physical activity (beta=0.54; P=.01) compared with CC at posttest. However, FM+ had nonsignificant differences compared with PA-only on self-report fatigue (beta=1.08, P=.84) and physical activity (beta=0.09; P=.68) at posttest. PA-only had significant improvements compared with CC on moderateto-vigorous exercise (beta=0.38; P=.02) at posttest and step count at posttest (beta=1.30; P<.01) and follow-up (beta=1.31; P=.01) measured with an accelerometer. FM+ and PA-only had nonsignificant differences compared with CC on quality of life. Conclusions: Group teleconferences followed by tailored phone calls have a small yet statistically significant effect in promoting physical activity and reducing fatigue impact in people with MS.

Method: Persons with MS were recruited through the distribution of printed letters to a random sample of 1,000 persons from the North American Research Committee on MS registry. Two hundred ninety-five persons with MS were interested and volunteered to wear an ActiGraph accelerometer for a 7-day period and complete a battery of questionnaires that included the IPAQ-SF and Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire over this period of time. Results: IPAQ-SF sitting time scores were consistently and moderately correlated with all of the sedentary behavior metrics from the accelerometer (range of r between.295 and .431), and the correlations were stronger than those between self-reported physical activity and sedentary metrics from the accelerometer (range of r between -.087 and .163). The correlations between IPAQ-SF sitting time scores with the accelerometer-derived sedentary behavior metrics were still statistically significant in the analyses controlling for physical activity (range of parametric correlations between.281 and .411). Conclusions: The correlation analysis indicated consistent, moderate correlations between IPAQ-SF sitting time scores and device-measured estimates of both the volume and pattern of sedentary behavior, and the correlations were (a) stronger than those for self-reported physical activity and (b) independent of self-reported physical activity. Such results provide initial evidence for the validity of inferences from IPAQ-SF sitting time scores as an overall measure of sedentary behavior in persons with MS. Impact and Implications There is an abundance of research on physical activity in multiple sclerosis, but much less is known about sedentary behavior. This study provides evidence for the validity of inferences from the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form sitting time scores as a measure of sedentary behavior in multiple sclerosis. The evidence provides support for meaningful interpretations from existing and future research on the prevalence, correlates, and interventions focusing on sedentary behavior in multiple sclerosis.;"[Motl, Robert W.; Sasaki, Jeffer E.; Cederberg, Katie L.; Jeng, Brenda] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Sch Hlth Profess, Dept Phys Therapy, Birmingham, AL USA";Motl, RW (corresponding author), Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Phys Therapy, 1716 9th Ave South, Birmingham, AL 35233 USA.;robmotl@uab.edu;Sasaki, Jeffer/L-6001-2013;Sasaki, Jeffer/0000-0002-2083-4104;"National Multiple Sclerosis SocietyNational Multiple Sclerosis Society [PP 1412, MB 0011]; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI) [T32HL105349]; NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI) [T32HL105349, T32HL105349, T32HL105349] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER";The research was supported by a pilot grant from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (PP 1412), a mentor-based postdoctoral fellowship from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (MB 0011), and a predoctoral fellowship from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health (T32HL105349).

MSCopilot is a software medical device for the self-assessment of patients with MS (PwMS), combining four tests: walking, dexterity, cognition and low contrast vision. The objective was to validate MSCopilot versus the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC). Methods This multicentre, open-label, randomized, controlled, crossover study enrolled 141 PwMS and 76 healthy controls (HCs). All participants performed MSCopilot and MSFC tests at day 0. To assess reproducibility, 46 PwMS performed the same tests at day 30 +/- 3. The primary end-point was the validation of MSCopilot versus MSFC for the identification of PwMS against HCs, quantified using the area under the curve (AUC). The main secondary end-point was the correlation of MSCopilot z-scores with MSFC z-scores. Results In all, 116 PwMS and 69 HCs were analysed. The primary end-point was achieved: MSCopilot performance was non-inferior to that of MSFC (AUC 0.92 and 0.89 respectively; P = 0.3). MSCopilot and MSFC discriminated PwMS and HCs with 81% and 76% sensitivity and 82% and 88% specificity respectively. Digital and standard test scores were highly correlated (r = 0.81; P < 0.001). The test-retest study demonstrated the good reproducibility of MSCopilot.

However, the extent to which impairments in physical and cognitive functions are manifestations of MS and disease progression, reflective of the general aging process, or perhaps 2 detrimental processes exacerbating the synergistic effects of the other is relatively unknown. This study compared physical and cognitive functions, sedentary behavior, and physical activity between 40 older adults with MS (ie, 60 years of age and older) and 40 age- and sex-matched healthy older adults. We further examined whether physical activity and/or sedentary behavior explained differences between groups in physical and cognitive functions. Methods: Participants initially underwent the cognitive assessments, followed by the physical function assessments. The order of tests was standardized and participants were provided seated-rest between the administrations of the physical function assessments. Participants were then instructed to wear an accelerometer and document wear time in a log book for a 7-day period after the testing session. Results: Multivariate analyses of variance indicated that older adults with MS (n = 40) performed worse on all measures of physical function, and 1 measure of cognitive function (ie, information-processing speed), compared with healthy controls (n = 40). Older adults with MS engaged in less moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, more sedentary behavior, and longer duration of long sedentary bouts than healthy controls. Pearson correlations demonstrated that levels and patterns of physical activity were significantly associated with a majority of physical function variables but not cognitive function variables in both older adults with MS and healthy controls but to a greater extent in older adults with MS. Partial Pearson correlations further demonstrated that levels and patterns of sedentary behavior were significantly associated with a majority of physical function variables but not cognitive function variables primarily in older adults with MS. Linear regression analyses indicated that levels and patterns of physical activity and sedentary behavior partially accounted for differences in physical and cognitive function variables between older adults with MS and healthy controls. Conclusion: There is evidence of reduced function in older adults with MS, and this might be partially managed by behavioral interventions that target physical activity and sedentary behavior for the promotion of healthy aging in older adults with MS.;"[Bollaert, Rachel E.] Univ Illinois, Beckman Inst Adv Sci & Technol, 405 N Matthews Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Motl, Robert W.] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Phys Therapy, Birmingham, AL USA";Bollaert, RE (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Beckman Inst Adv Sci & Technol, 405 N Matthews Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.;reb5@illinois.edu;;;University of Illinois Paul D.

To date, this relationship has been predominantly examined in young and middle-aged adults rather than in the rapidly-growing population of older adults with MS who often times have greater walking problems and are less physically active. This study examined whether physical activity was differentially associated with walking performance across three age groups of young (20-39 years), middle-aged (40-59 years), and older (60-79 years) adults with MS. Methods: The sample included 124 persons with MS who attended one testing session and provided demographic information, completed the Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW) and the Six Minute Walk (6MW) as measures of walking speed and walking endurance, respectively, and wore an accelerometer for a 7-day period. Results: Trend analysis indicated light physical activity did not significantly differ with increasing age; however, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), walking speed, and walking endurance declined with increasing age. Partial spearman's rank-order correlations between physical activity and walking outcomes that controlled for disease duration, race, and ambulatory disability within each age group indicated that the relationship between MVPA and walking performance was strong among older adults with MS (pr(s) for MVPA and T25FW: young = -0.01, middle-aged = -0.16, older = -0.63*; pr(s) for MVPA and 6MW: young = 0.10, middle-aged = 0.08, older = 0.68*).

Objective: Hypothesis: This preliminary, cross-sectional study examined social-cognitive theory (SCT) variables as correlates of sedentary behavior in MS. We hypothesized that scores from SCT variables for sedentary behavior change would correlate with scores from self-reported and device-measured volumes of sedentary behavior in MS. We further hypothesized that the correlations would be stronger for self-reported than device-measured sedentary behavior, and that the primary correlate of sedentary behavior would be self-efficacy. Methods: We recruited participants through a random sample of 1,000 persons enrolled in the North American Research Committee on MS registry, and 275 of the 296 persons who underwent screening volunteered for the study. Participants wore an ActiGraph accelerometer on a belt around the waist for measuring minutes per day of sedentary behavior. Participants further completed a newly-created, study-specific measure of SCT variables for reducing sedentary behavior (i.e., self-efficacy, outcome expectations, barriers, goal setting, & planning) and the abbreviated International Physical Activity Questionnaire as a self-report measure of sitting time. Results: Self-reported sedentary behavior was associated with self-efficacy (r = -0.47), goal setting (r = -0.31), planning (r = -0.35), and barriers (r = 0.39) for reducing sedentary behavior. Device-measured sedentary behavior was associated with self-efficacy (r = -0.32), goal setting (r = -0.21), planning (r = -0.18), and barriers (r = 0.20). Self-efficacy (beta = -0.29), barriers (beta = 0.26), and planning (beta = -0.24) independently explained variance in self-reported sedentary behavior (R-2 = 0.33). Only self-efficacy (beta = -0.32) independently explained variance in device-measured sedentary behavior (R-2 = 0.10).

Walking is traditionally quantified with various measures, including patient self-reports, clinical rating scales, performance measures, and advanced lab-based movement analysis techniques. Yet, the majority of these measures do not fully characterize walking (i.e., gait quality) nor adequately reflect walking in the real world (i.e., community ambulation) and have limited timescale (only measure walking at a single point in time). We discuss the potential of wearable sensors to provide sensitive, objective, and easy-to-use assessment of community ambulation in PwMS. Recent Findings Wearable technology has the ability to measure all aspects of gait in PwMS yet is under-studied in comparison with other populations (e.g., older adults). Within the studies focusing on PwMS, half that measure pace collected free-living data, while only one study explored gait variability in free-living conditions. No studies explore gait asymmetry or complexity in free-living conditions. Wearable technology has the ability to provide objective, comprehensive, and sensitive measures of gait in PwMS. Future research should investigate this technology's ability to accurately assess free-living measures of gait quality, specifically gait asymmetry and complexity.;"[Frechette, Mikaela L.; Sosnoff, Jacob J.] Univ Illinois, Motor Control Res Lab, Dept Kinesiol & Community Hlth, 301 Freer Hall 906 S Goodwin Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Meyer, Brett M.; Tulipani, Lindsey J.; Gurchiek, Reed D.; McGinnis, Ryan S.] Univ Vermont, Dept Elect & Biomed Engn, M Sense Res Grp, Burlington, VT 05405 USA";Sosnoff, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Motor Control Res Lab, Dept Kinesiol & Community Hlth, 301 Freer Hall 906 S Goodwin Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.;jsosnoff@illinois.edu;;;;;;99;12;12;0;9;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;1528-4042;1534-6293;;CURR NEUROL NEUROSCI;Curr.

By combining two-photon imaging and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the most widely used rodent model of multiple sclerosis (MS), it has been possible, for example, to study how axons degenerate when confronted with inflammatory cells, how oligo-dendrocytes get damaged in inflammatory lesions, and how immune cells themselves adapt their phenotype and functionality to the changing lesion environment. Similar approaches are now increasingly used to study other forms of neuroinflammation, such as antibody/complement-mediated neuromyelitis optica spectrum disease (NMOSD). To tackle the most pressing open questions in the field, new biosensors and indicator mice that report the metabolic state and interaction of cells in neuroinflammatory lesions are being developed. Moreover, the field is moving towards new anatomical sites of inflammation, such as the cortical gray matter, but also towards longer observation intervals to reveal the chronic perturbations and adaptations that characterize advanced stages of MS.;"[Schumacher, Adrian-Minh; Kerschensteiner, Martin; Snaidero, Nicolas] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Univ Hosp, Inst Clin Neuroimmunol, Munich, Germany; [Schumacher, Adrian-Minh; Kerschensteiner, Martin] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Fac Med, Biomed Ctr BMC, Martinsried, Germany; [Misgeld, Thomas; Snaidero, Nicolas] Tech Univ Munich, Inst Neuronal Cell Biol, Biedersteiner Str 29, D-80802 Munich, Germany; [Kerschensteiner, Martin] Munich Cluster Syst Neurol SyNergy, Munich, Germany; [Misgeld, Thomas; Snaidero, Nicolas] German Ctr Neurodegenerat Dis DZNE, Munich, Germany; [Misgeld, Thomas] Ctr Integrated Prot Sci CIPSM, Munich, Germany";"Snaidero, N (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Inst Neuronal Cell Biol, Biedersteiner Str 29, D-80802 Munich, Germany.; Schumacher, AM (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilians Univ Miinchen, Univ Hosp, Inst Clin Neuroimmunol, Grosshaderner Str 9, D-82152 Planegg Martinsried, Germany.";"Minh.Schumacher@med.uni-muenchen.de; nicolas.snaidero@tum.de";;;"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [TRR128]; European Research Council under the European UnionEuropean Research Council (ERC) [310932]; German Federal Ministry of Research and Education (BMBF; Competence Network Multiple Sclerosis)Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF); German National MS Society (DMSG); Gemeinnutzige Hertie Stiftung; DFGGerman Research Foundation (DFG)European Commission [Ke 774/5-1/Mi 694/7-1, CIPSM EXC114, CRC870, Mi 694/8-1]; European Research CouncilEuropean Research Council (ERC)European Commission [616791]; Munich Center for Systems Neurology [SyNergy EXC 1010]; Verein Therapieforschung fur MS-Kranke e.V.";"Work in M.K.'s laboratory is financed through grants from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG; TRR128, Project B10 and B13), the European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Program (FP/2007-2013; ERC Grant Agreement n. 310932), the German Federal Ministry of Research and Education (BMBF; Competence Network Multiple Sclerosis), the Verein Therapieforschung fur MS-Kranke e.V., the German National MS Society (DMSG) and the Gemeinnutzige Hertie Stiftung.

Purpose: This study involved a secondary analysis of data focused on SCT constructs as correlates of individual-level changes (i.e., response heterogeneity) following a behavioral intervention. Method: Twenty-two persons with MS who completed a 6-month SCT-based behavioral intervention for increasing physical activity were included in analyses. The intervention consisted of two primary components, namely a dedicated Internet website and one-on-one video chats with a behavioral coach. Outcomes included objectively-measured moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) using Actigraph model GT3X+ accelerometers and self-reported physical activity using the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ) as well as SCT variables of exercise self-efficacy, barriers self-efficacy, outcome expectations, goal setting and planning and facilitators/impediments. Results: There was individual variability in physical activity change following the intervention. For example, 4/22 participants demonstrated a reduction in MVPA, 1/22 participants had no change, 9/22 participants had less than 0.5 standard deviation (SD) increase in MVPA, and 8/22 participants had an increase in MVPA of more than 0.5 SD. Baseline SCT variables, particularly outcome expectations, goal setting, planning, and barriers self-efficacy, correlated with increased physical activity. Conclusions: This study indicates that SCT variables correlate with the response heterogeneity associated with physical activity behavioral interventions, and this might inform the delivery of interventions consistent with Bandura's stepwise implementation model for optimizing the fit of an intervention based on SCT for maximizing treatment efficacy in MS.;"[Silveira, Stephanie L.; Motl, Robert W.] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Phys Therapy, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA";Silveira, SL (corresponding author), Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Phys Therapy, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA.;ssilveira@uab.edu;;Silveira, Stephanie/0000-0002-1973-2119;National Multiple Sclerosis SocietyNational Multiple Sclerosis Society [RG 5144A6/1, MB 0029];This study was supported by the National Multiple Sclerosis Society [RG 5144A6/1 & MB 0029].;;24;3;3;1;2;ELSEVIER INC;SAN DIEGO;525 B STREET, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA;;2451-8654;;CONT CLIN TRIAL COMM;Contemp.

Despite the devastating effects of tremor on life quality, available treatments are few and unspecific. Because of the need for specific and costly devices, tremor is rarely quantified by laboratories studying motor control without a genuine interest in trembling. We present a simple, reliable, and affordable method aimed at monitoring tremor in rodents, with an accuracy comparable to that of expensive, commercially available equipment. We took advantage of the accelerometer integrated in modern mobile phones working with operating systems capable of running down-loaded apps. By fixing a smartphone to a cage suspended by rubber bands, we were able to detect faint vibrations of the cage. With a mouse in the cage, we showed that the acceleration signals on two horizontal axes were sufficient for the detection of physiological tremor and harmaline-induced tremor. We discuss the advantages and limitations of our method. NEW & NOTEWORTHY The majority of patients suffering from neurological disorders suffer from tremor that severely disrupts their life quality. Because of the high cost of specific scientific equipment, tremor is rarely quantified by laboratories working on motor behavior.

Within the medicine domain, there has been a rapid increase in the development, testing, and use of wearable technologies especially in the context of neurological diseases. Although wearables represent promising tools also in multiple sclerosis (MS), the research on their application in MS is still ongoing, and further studies are required to assess their reliability and accuracy to monitor body functions and disability in people with MS (pwMS). Here, we provided a comprehensive overview of the opportunities, potential challenges, and limitations of the wearable technology use in MS. In particular, we classified previous findings within this field into macro-categories, considered crucial for disease management: assessment, monitoring, intervention, advice, and education. Given the increasing pivotal role played by wearables, current literature suggests that for pwMS, the time is right to shift from a center-based traditional therapeutic paradigm toward a personalized patient-based disease self-management. On this way, we present two ongoing initiatives aimed at implementing a continuous monitoring of pwMS and, consequently, providing timely and appropriate care interventions.;"[Brichetto, Giampaolo; Pedulla, Ludovico; Podda, Jessica; Tacchino, Andrea] Italian Multiple Sclerosis Fdn, Sci Res Area, Via Operai 40, I-16149 Genoa, Italy; [Brichetto, Giampaolo; Podda, Jessica] Italian Multiple Sclerosis Soc, Rehabil Ctr, Genoa, Italy; [Pedulla, Ludovico] Univ Genoa, Dept Expt Med, Genoa, Italy";Brichetto, G (corresponding author), Italian Multiple Sclerosis Fdn, Sci Res Area, Via Operai 40, I-16149 Genoa, Italy.;giampaolo.brichetto@aism.it;"Brichetto, Giampaolo/ABB-4188-2020; Brichetto, Giampaolo/D-2497-2011; Tacchino, Andrea/AAH-2597-2020";"Brichetto, Giampaolo/0000-0003-2026-3572; Brichetto, Giampaolo/0000-0003-2026-3572; Tacchino, Andrea/0000-0002-2263-7315; PODDA, JESSICA/0000-0002-9327-9148";;;;61;5;5;2;4;SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD;LONDON;1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND;1352-4585;1477-0970;;MULT SCLER J;Mult.

Biotin cannot be synthesized by mammals and must be taken as an essential supplement. Normal intake of biotin from various foods and milk causes no effect on the streptavidin/biotin-based immunoassays. However, overconsumption of biotin (daily doses 100-300 mg) poses a significant problem for immunoassays using the biotin-strept(avidin) pair. Biotin interferences are noted in immunoassays of thyroid markers, drugs, hormones, cancer markers, the biomarker for cardiac function (beta-human chorionic gonadotropin), etc. The biotin level required for serious interference in test results varies significantly from test to test and cannot easily be predicted. Immunoassay manufacturers with technologies based on strept(avidin)-biotin binding must investigate the interference from biotin (up to at least 1200 ng/mL or 4.9 mu M of biotin) in various formats. There is no concrete solution to circumvent the biotin interference encountered in blood samples, short of biotin removal. Considering the short half-life of biotin in the human body, patients must stop taking biotin supplements for > 48 h before the test. However, this scenario is not considered for patients in emergency situations or those with biotinidase deficiency, mitochondrial metabolic disorders or multiple sclerosis. Apparently, a rapid analytical procedure for biotin is urgently needed to quantify for its interference in immunoassays using strep(avidin)-biotin chemistry. To date, there is no quick and reliable procedure for the detection of biotin at below nanomolar levels in blood and biological samples. Traditional lab-based techniques including HPLC/MS-MS cannot process an enormous number of public samples. Biosensors with high detection sensitivity, miniaturization, low cost, and multiplexing have the potential to address this issue.;"[Luong, John H.

Objective: The goal of the research was to assess the feasibility of remote active testing and passive monitoring using smartphones and smartwatch technology in persosns with multiple sclerosis with respect to adherence and satisfaction with the FLOODLIGHT test battery. Methods: Persons with multiple sclerosis (aged 20 to 57 years; Expanded Disability Status Scale 0-5.5; n=76) and healthy controls (n=25) performed the FLOODLIGHT test battery, comprising active tests (daily, weekly, every two weeks, or on demand) and passive monitoring (sensor-based gait and mobility) for 24 weeks using a smartphone and smartwatch. The primary analysis assessed adherence (proportion of weeks with at least 3 days of completed testing and 4 hours per day passive monitoring) and questionnaire-based satisfaction. In-clinic assessments (clinical and magnetic resonance imaging) were performed. Results: Persons with multiple sclerosis showed 70% (16.68/24 weeks) adherence to active tests and 79% (18.89/24 weeks) to passive monitoring; satisfaction score was on average 73.7 out of 100. Neither adherence nor satisfaction was associated with specific population characteristics. Test-battery assessments had an at least acceptable impact on daily activities in over 80% (61/72) of persons with multiple sclerosis. Conclusions: Persons with multiple sclerosis were engaged and satisfied with the FLOODLIGHT test battery.

Changes in PB are often assumed as a consequence of fatigue, but effects of interventions that aim to reduce fatigue by improving PB are not sufficient. Since the heterogeneous nature of MS related symptoms, levels of PB of fatigued patients at the start of interventions might vary substantially. Better understanding of the variability by identification of PB subtypes in fatigued patients may help to develop more effective personalized rehabilitation programs in the future. This study aimed to identify PB subtypes in fatigued patients with multiple sclerosis based on multidimensional PB outcome measures. Methods Baseline accelerometer (Actigraph) data, demographics and clinical characteristics of the TREFAMS-ACE participants (n = 212) were used for secondary analysis. All patients were ambulatory and diagnosed with severe fatigue based on a score of >= 35 on the fatigue subscale of the Checklist Individual Strength (CIS20r). Fifteen PB measures were used derived from 7 day measurements with an accelerometer. Principal component analysis was performed to define key outcome measures for PB and two-step cluster analysis was used to identify PB types. Results Analysis revealed five key outcome measures: percentage sedentary behavior, total time in prolonged moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, number of sedentary bouts, and two types of change scores between day parts (morning, afternoon and evening). Based on these outcomes three valid PB clusters were derived. Conclusions Patients with severe MS-related fatigue show three distinct and homogeneous PB subtypes. These PB subtypes, based on a unique set of PB outcome measures, may offer an opportunity to design more individually-tailored interventions in rehabilitation.;"[Braakhuis, H. E. M.; van der Stok, G.

However, their ecological validity has recently been questioned. The aim of the present study was to investigate the ecological validity of the 2- and 6-minutes walking tests (2MWT and 6MWT) and the timed 25-foot walk (T25FW) after 28 days of multidisciplinary inpatient rehabilitation (MIR) in pwMS using accelerometry. Methods PwMS wore an accelerometer on 7 consecutive days within a 14-day period prior to MIR, performed 2/6MWT and T25FW at the beginning and at the end of MIR, followed by another 7 consecutive days of accelerometry. Results Significant improvements in 2/6MWT and T25FW after MIR in a cohort of 76 pwMS (mean age = 47.9, SD 8.3 years) were overall correlated to a significant gain in everyday life mobility (total steps/day). However, the correlation was strongly dependent on pre-existing walking disability defined by EDSS and only pwMS with mild walking impairment (EDSS 2-3.5) were able to transfer benefits measurable by walking capacity tests into improved everyday life mobility, while pwMS with moderate to severe walking disability (EDSS 4-6.5) were not. Conclusion Ecological validity of changes in walking capacity tests following MIR is strongly dependent on pre-existing walking impairment.;"[Ehling, Rainer; Muehlbacher, Andreas; Hermann, Kay; Brenneis, Christian] Clin Rehabil Munster, Dept Neurol, Munster, Austria; [Ehling, Rainer; Brenneis, Christian] Karl Landsteiner Inst Interdisziplinare Forsch, Reha Zentrum Munster, Munster, Austria; [Bsteh, Gabriel] Med Univ Innsbruck, Clin Dept Neurol, Innsbruck, Austria";"Ehling, R (corresponding author), Clin Rehabil Munster, Dept Neurol, Munster, Austria.; Ehling, R (corresponding author), Karl Landsteiner Inst Interdisziplinare Forsch, Reha Zentrum Munster, Munster, Austria.";rainer.ehling@reha-muenster.at;;;Austrian Multiple Sclerosis Research Foundation;This work was supported by a research grant of the Austrian Multiple Sclerosis Research Foundation (no grant number).

Methods This two-phase study recruited online research network members reporting MS and who were utilizing Fitbit One (TM) activity trackers. In the first phase, participant interviews assessed demand based on physical activity and the use of behavior-change techniques. The second phase assessed the demand, limited efficacy, acceptability, and practicality of a Wearables 101 course that integrated behavior change and self-experimentation principles. Tracker data were used to determine the percent of matches between daily symptom-based step goals and step counts. Results Participants expressed demand in the form of interest in gaining insights about a possible sweet spot behavioral target, if a system could be produced to support that. Limited efficacy results were mixed, with approximately one-third of participants dropping out and only half matching their daily target goals for at least 50% of days. In terms of practicality, participants commented on the burden of daily measurement and the need for a longer baseline period. Participants noted that tracking helped support an understanding of the link between activities and symptom severity, suggesting acceptability. Conclusions Results suggested that the intervention demand and acceptability criteria were demonstrated more strongly than limited efficacy and practicality. The matching intervention tested in this study will require refinement in baseline measurement, goal definition, and reduced data-gathering burden. Such changes may improve efficacy and practicality requirements and, by extension, later impact of the intervention on MS outcomes. Overall, these results provide justification for additional work on refining the intervention to increase practicality and efficacy.;"[Chiauzzi, Emil; Towner, Auriell; DasMahapatra, Pronabesh; Fitz-Randolph, Marcy] PatientsLikeMe Inc, 160 Second St, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Hekler, Eric B.; Lee, Jisoo] Arizona State Univ, Sch Nutr & Hlth Promot, Phoenix, AZ USA";Chiauzzi, E (corresponding author), PatientsLikeMe Inc, 160 Second St, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.;echiauzzi@outlook.com;;;Health Data Exploration project (Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (Health Data Exploration: Developing A Research Network to Accelerate Research with Personal Health Data in Medicine, Public Health, and Behavioral and Social Science);"The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: We would like to acknowledge Agile Project Grant subaward funding received through the Health Data Exploration project (Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (Health Data Exploration: Developing A Research Network to Accelerate Research with Personal Health Data in Medicine, Public Health, and Behavioral and Social Science), awarded to the University of California, San Diego; Kevin Patrick, PI).";;27;2;2;0;0;SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD;LONDON;1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND;2055-2076;;;DIGIT HEALTH;Digit.

The European Union Innovative Medicines Initiative Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse-Central Nervous System (RADAR-CNS) program is an exemplary project with the requirements to support the collection of high-resolution data at scale; as such, the Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse (RADAR)-base platform is designed to meet these needs and additionally facilitate a new generation of mHealth projects in this nascent field. Objective: Wide-bandwidth networks, smartphone penetrance, and wearable sensors offer new possibilities for collecting near-real-time high-resolution datasets from large numbers of participants. The aim of this study was to build a platform that would cater for large-scale data collection for remote monitoring initiatives. Key criteria are around scalability, extensibility, security, and privacy. Methods: RADAR-base is developed as a modular application; the backend is built on a backbone of the highly successful Confluent/Apache Kafka framework for streaming data. To facilitate scaling and ease of deployment, we use Docker containers to package the components of the platform. RADAR-base provides 2 main mobile apps for data collection, a Passive App and an Active App. Other third-Party Apps and sensors are easily integrated into the platform. Management user interfaces to support data collection and enrolment are also provided. Results: General principles of the platform components and design of RADAR-base are presented here, with examples of the types of data currently being collected from devices used in RADAR-CNS projects: Multiple Sclerosis, Epilepsy, and Depression cohorts.

Embedded technologies and low-cost sensors can be used for the longitudinal follow-up of various populations (neurological diseases, elderly, etc.). However, the comparison of two gait trials remains a tricky question as standard gait features may prove to be insufficient in some cases. This article describes a new algorithm for comparing two gait trials recorded with inertial measurement units (IMUs). This algorithm uses a library of step templates extracted from one trial and attempts to detect similar steps in the second trial through a greedy template matching approach. The output of our method is a similarity index (SId) comprised between 0 and 1 that reflects the similarity between the patterns observed in both trials. Results on healthy and multiple sclerosis subjects show that this new comparison tool can be used for both inter-individual comparison and longitudinal follow-up.;"[Vienne-Jumeau, Alienor; Oudre, Laurent; Moreau, Albane; Quijoux, Flavien; Vidal, Pierre-Paul; Ricard, Damien] Univ Paris 05, CNRS, Serv Sante Armees, COGNAC G,UMR 8257, F-75006 Paris, France; [Oudre, Laurent] Univ Paris 13, L2TI, F-93430 Villetaneuse, France; [Oudre, Laurent] CNRS ENS Paris Saclay, CMLA, UMR 8536, F-94235 Cachan, France; [Quijoux, Flavien] ORPEA Grp, F-92813 Puteaux La Defense, France; [Vidal, Pierre-Paul] Hangzhou Dianzi Univ, Hangzhou 310005, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Ricard, Damien] Hop Instruct Armees Percy, Serv Sante Armees, Serv Neurol, F-92190 Clamart, France; [Ricard, Damien] Ecole Sante Armees, Ecole Val de Grace, F-75005 Paris, France";"Oudre, L (corresponding author), Univ Paris 05, CNRS, Serv Sante Armees, COGNAC G,UMR 8257, F-75006 Paris, France.; Oudre, L (corresponding author), Univ Paris 13, L2TI, F-93430 Villetaneuse, France.; Oudre, L (corresponding author), CNRS ENS Paris Saclay, CMLA, UMR 8536, F-94235 Cachan, France.";laurent.oudre@univ-paris13.fr;Oudre, Laurent/AAM-5129-2020;Oudre, Laurent/0000-0002-4750-2265;SATT-IDF INNOV;This work was supported by SATT-IDF INNOV.;;58;2;2;0;5;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;1424-8220;;SENSORS-BASEL;Sensors;JUL 12;2019;19;14;;;;;;;3089;10.3390/s19143089;;;17;"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation";"Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation";IO1RT;WOS:000479160300057;31336957;DOAJ Gold, Green Published;;;2021-03-18;

Methods: 91 patients with multiple sclerosis were enrolled. Assessments included physical activity by 7-day thigh-worn accelerometry, knee extensor neuromuscular function by dynamometry (maximal isometric muscle strength, rate of force development (0-50 ms)), and physical function by 5x sit-to-stand, 2-min walk test, and timed 25 ft walk test. Physical activity tertile comparisons along with simple and multiple regressions (adjusting for age, gender, EDSS, time since diagnosis) were performed. Results: Physical activity tertiles revealed differences (p < 0.05) in maximal muscle strength (1.77 approximate to 1.97 < 2.28 Nm/kg), rate of force development (4.66 < 8.03 approximate to 10.55 Nm/kg/s), 5x sit-to-stand (11.4 approximate to 9.7 > 8.5 s), 2-min walk test (153 < 183 < 207 m), and timed 25 ft walk test (6.3 > 4.4 > 4.3 s). Moreover, physical activity was associated (p < 0.05) with maximal muscle strength and rate of force development (r(2) = 0.13-0.15) along with 5x sit-to-stand, 2-min walk test, and timed 25 ft walk test (r(2) = 0.18-0.24), also after adjusting for age + gender + EDSS + time since diagnosis (r(2) = 0.25-0.37 and 0.24-0.52), with physical activity consistently being a strong predictor. Conclusions: Higher levels of physical activity are associated with greater neuromuscular and physical function in ambulatory patients with multiple sclerosis independent of disease severity.

Despite the plethora of applications, the current cooling systems are cumbersome to use due to their excessive size. In this work this issue is resolved by developing soft, thermally conductive silicone-aluminum composite tubes. To achieve optimal device performance, the material must be designed to balance the decrease in bulk thermal resistance and the increase in interfacial tube-substrate resistance due to composite stiffening. Thus, to enable the rational design of such tubes, a closed form thermomechanical model that predicts cooling performance as a function of tube geometry and filler fraction is developed and experimentally validated. Predictions via this model and experiments are used to reveal how the tube's geometrical and material design can be adjusted to minimize the required length of tubing and maximize the heat extracted from a metallic surface and skin. Lastly, through a holistic analysis, this work demonstrates that besides significantly increasing overall cooling capability, the use of low-resistance tubing can provide a multifold reduction in the cooling system size and enable novel operating modes.;"[Kotagama, Praveen; Phadnis, Akshay; Manning, Kenneth C.; Rykaczewski, Konrad] Arizona State Univ, Sch Engn Matter Transport & Energy, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA";Rykaczewski, K (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Engn Matter Transport & Energy, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.;konradr@asu.edu;;;National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1724452];The authors gratefully acknowledge funding from the National Science Foundation through award number CBET #1724452.

In this work, new sensor materials for disposable single-step protease biosensors based on poly(2-oxazoline) hydrogels cross-linked with a protease-specific cleavable peptide are described. The performance of the sensor material was assessed targeting the detection of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), a protease that has been shown to be an indicator of inflammation in multiple sclerosis and other inflammatory conditions. Films of the hydrogel were formed on gold-coated quartz crystals using thiol-ene click chemistry, and the cross-link density was optimized. The degradation rate of the hydrogel was monitored using a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) and showed a strong dependence on the MMP-9 concentration. A concentration range of 0-160 nM of MMP-9 was investigated, and a lower limit of detection of 10 nM MMP-9 was determined.;"[Ahmad, Norlaily; Colak, Burcu; Gibbs, Martin John; Gautrot, Julien E.; Krause, Steffi] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Engn & Mat Sci, London E1 4NS, England; [Zhang, De-Wen] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Hlth Sci Ctr, Sch Basic Med Sci, Inst Med Engn, Xian 710061, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Watkinson, Michael] Keele Univ, Sch Chem & Phys Sci, Lennard Jones Labs, Keele ST5 5BG, Staffs, England; [Becer, C.

This study sought to investigate potential barriers and facilitators for uptake and sustained use in (i) people with both relapsing remitting MS (RAMS) and progressive MS (PMS) and (ii) across different countries. Methods: Twenty four participants with MS took part in four focus groups held in three countries (2 in the UK, 1 in Spain, and 1 in Italy) to investigate potential barriers and facilitators for mHealth technology. A systematic thematic analysis was used to extract themes and sub-themes. Results: Facilitators and barriers were organised into functional technology-related factors and non-functional health-related and user-related factors. Twelve themes captured all requirements across the three countries for both RAMS and PMS. Key requirements included accommodation for varying physical abilities, providing information and memory aids. Potential negative effects on mood and providing choice and control as part of overcoming practical challenges were identified. Conclusions: We took a cross-national perspective and found many similarities between three European countries across people with RAMS and PMS.

The Alemtuzumab in MS Safety Systems (AMS3) study evaluated the implementation of an automated pathology-monitoring system. Objectives: To develop an efficient automated clinical decision support system (CDSS) to electronically prompt and track pathology collection and to provide prescribers and patients with customised alerts of abnormal results for identified risks. Methods: A total of 10 patients with relapsing-remitting MS treated with alemtuzumab were enrolled to test the system. Standard care laboratory monitoring was performed and compared to the performance of the CDSS. Results: The automated CDSS, an integrated patient smartphone application and an additional pre-screening tool were all successfully developed. Compliance with pathology monitoring was 96.7%. The automated analysis of pathology results was significantly faster than standard care neurologist review (p < 0.001). The system correctly identified and alerted abnormalities, including one case of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) while the treating neurologist was on leave, enabling prompt treatment of serious adverse events. During the course of the study, the CDSS was deployed throughout Australia. Conclusion: We successfully developed automated pathology monitoring with a CDSS, demonstrating real-world benefits of high compliance and timely alerting of important results.;"[Reddel, Stephen W.] Univ Sydney, Concord Hosp, Dept Neurol, Level 5W, Concord, NSW 2139, Australia; [Barnett, Michael H.; Wang, Chenu Tim] Brain & Mind Ctr, Sydney Neuroimaging Anal Ctr, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Barnett, Michael H.] Royal Prince Alfred Hosp, Dept Neurol, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Riminton, Sean] Univ Sydney, Concord Hosp, Dept Immunol, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Dugal, Tej] Norwest Med Imaging, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Buzzard, Katherine] Royal Melbourne Hosp, Dept Neurol, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Fitzgerald, Fiona; Gahan, David] Med Safety Syst, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Beadnall, Heidi N.] Brain & Mind Ctr, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Wang, Daniel] Converged IT, Singapore, Singapore; [Ackland, Toby] Converged IT, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Thompson, Richard] Converged IT, Auckland, New Zealand";Reddel, SW (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Concord Hosp, Dept Neurol, Level 5W, Concord, NSW 2139, Australia.;swreddel@sydneyneurology.com.au;;;"Sanofi-Genzyme; Sydney Local Health District of the NSW state government of Australia";"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article: The AMS3 study was an investigator-sponsored study, for which support was provided by Sanofi-Genzyme, via the provision of funding and product only.

Participants (n=63 [15M and 48F], age: 56.67.3years) wore an accelerometer on the hip for a 7-day period and completed the MSQ. Sedentary behaviour (SB) estimates were computed as min/day for both the MSQ and accelerometer. Associations between the two methods were examined using the Pearson correlation and agreement was assessed using a Bland-Altman plot. A linear prediction model was developed to improve the accuracy of the MSQ estimates using a selection of predictor variables routinely collected in MS research. There was a moderate correlation between MSQ and accelerometer SB estimates (r =0.34, p <0.01). The Bland-Altman plot indicated that the MSQ overestimated SB (mean bias: 80.54min/day, 95% limits of agreement: -410.5 to 571.5min/day). The prediction model improved the MSQ estimates by 39% and virtually eliminated measurement bias (mean bias:-0.21min/day; 95% limits of agreement:-109.8 to 109.4min/day).

The interim goal is to develop simple smartphone tests (apps) and evaluate the clinical utility of these tests by selecting optimal outcomes that correlate well with clinician-measured disability in different neurological domains. In this paper, we used prospectively-acquired data from 112 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and 15 healthy volunteers (HV) to assess the performance and optimize outcomes of a Level Test. The goal of the test is to tilt the smartphone so that a free-rolling ball travels to and remains in the center of the screen. An accelerometer detects tilting and records the coordinates of the ball at set time intervals. From this data, we derived five features: path length traveled, time spent in the center of the screen, average distance from the center, average speed while in the center, and number of direction changes underwent by the ball. Time in center proved to be the most sensitive feature to differentiate MS patients from HV and had the strongest correlations with clinician-derived scales. Its superiority was validated in an independent validation cohort of 29 MS patients. A linear combination of different Level features failed to outperform time in center in an independent validation cohort. Limited longitudinal data demonstrated that the Level features were relatively stable intra-individually within 4 months, without definitive evidence of learning. In contrast to previously developed smartphone tests that predominantly measure motoric functions, Level features correlated strongly with reaction time and moderately with cerebellar functions and proprioception, validating its complementary clinical value in the MS app suite. The Level Test measures neurological disability in several domains in two independent cross-sectional cohorts (original and validation). An ongoing longitudinal cohort further investigates whether patient-autonomous collection of granular functional data allows measurement of patient-specific trajectories of disability progression to better guide treatment decisions.;"[Boukhvalova, Alexandra K.; Fan, Olivia; Weideman, Ann Marie; Harris, Thomas; Kowalczyk, Emily; Linh Pham; Kosa, Peter; Bielekova, Bibiana] NIAID, Neuroimmunol Dis Sect, Lab Clin Immunol & Microbbl, NIH, 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Kowalczyk, Emily] Univ Maryland, Dept Comp Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA";Bielekova, B (corresponding author), NIAID, Neuroimmunol Dis Sect, Lab Clin Immunol & Microbbl, NIH, 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.;bibi.bielekova@nih.gov;"Bielekova, Bibiana/AAA-8115-2020; Bielekova, Bibiana/V-1452-2017";"Bielekova, Bibiana/0000-0002-0959-9430; Bielekova, Bibiana/0000-0002-0959-9430; Boukhvalova, Alexandra/0000-0001-6458-1180; Pham, Linh/0000-0001-6664-726X";"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [NS003055-11]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [ZIAAI001242] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER";The study was supported by the intramural research program of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) (grant no.

Those who volunteered wore an accelerometer for 7d and provided sociodemographic and clinical information.Results: There were 233 persons with MS who were included in the analyses. Linear regression analyses indicated that age and MS type explained significant variance in total sedentary time per day as well as number of breaks in sedentary time. Only disability status explained significant variance in sedentary bout length, whereas age explained significant variance in both number of long sedentary bouts per day. Both age and disability status explained significant variance total time spent in long sedentary bouts per day.Conclusions: Persons of older age, progressive MS, and higher disability status spend prolonged, uninterrupted periods of time sedentary. Such results highlight the need for targeted interventions in sub-populations of MS that reduce time spent sedentary and break up the pattern of sedentary behaviour.Implications for RehabilitationSedentary behaviour is highly prevalent in multiple sclerosis and may be associated with comorbid conditions.The majority of research on sedentary behaviour in multiple sclerosis has been derived from self-report instruments that only measure the volume of sitting time per day.This study indicates that persons with multiple sclerosis spend a significant amount of time sedentary, and those who are older, have progressive multiple sclerosis, and have higher disability status spend prolonged, uninterrupted periods of time sedentary.Such results highlight the need for targeted behavioural interventions in these sub-populations of multiple sclerosis to reduce time spent sedentary and break the pattern of sedentary behaviour to manage its consequences.;"[Jeng, Brenda; Cederberg, Katie L.; Motl, Robert W.] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Phys Therapy, Sch Hlth Profess, 1720 2nd Ave S, Birmingham, AL 25394 USA; [Sasaki, Jeffer E.] Univ Fed Triangulo Mineiro, Dept Sport Sci, Uberaba, Brazil";Jeng, B (corresponding author), Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Phys Therapy, Sch Hlth Profess, 1720 2nd Ave S, Birmingham, AL 25394 USA.;bjeng@uab.edu;Sasaki, Jeffer/L-6001-2013;Sasaki, Jeffer/0000-0002-2083-4104;"National Multiple Sclerosis SocietyNational Multiple Sclerosis Society [PP 1412, MB 0011]; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI) [T32HL105349]; NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI) [T32HL105349, T32HL105349, T32HL105349] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER";The research was supported, in part, by a pilot grant from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (PP 1412), a mentor-based post-doctoral fellowship from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (MB 0011), and a mentor-based pre-doctoral fellowship from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health (T32HL105349).;;28;1;1;0;1;TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0963-8288;1464-5165;;DISABIL REHABIL;Disabil.

Complex balance tasks, such as tandem walking, are probably more sensitive in detecting mild balance difficulties compared to the standard traditional tests in this population. Research question: The aim was to investigate different types of 3-meter tandem walking tests in fully ambulatory PwMS. Methods: This observational case-control study included 50 participants; 25 PwMS, 17 women and 8 men, aged 35.2 (S.D = 8.6) and 25 healthy subjects, 18 women and 7 men, aged 34.3 (S.D = 6.1). The 3-meter tandem walk tests were performed during a single session. Each subject completed a sequence of 3 consecutive tests under 3 different task conditions: normal tandem walking, backward tandem walking and cognitive tandem walking. Tandem walking tests were evaluated via three small, lightweight axial wearable accelerometers (APDM, Oregon, USA). Results: The mean EDSS for the MS group was 1.6 (S.D = 0.6) indicating minimal disability. PwMS walked slower and at a slower pace, with a prolonged double support and decreased swing phase compared to healthy subjects in normal and backward conditions. In contrast, during the cognitive task, non-significant differences were found in gait measures between the PwMS and the healthy controls. Significant differences were found between task conditions for all participants. All reduced their walking speed and walked at a slower pace in both the cognitive and backward conditions compared to the normal tandem walk condition. However, non-significant scores were found for the condition X group factor. Significance: The study provides new insights into the 3-meter tandem walk test. Findings should improve evaluation and training of dynamic balance in fully ambulatory PwMS.";"[Grinberg, Yevgenia; Berkowitz, Shani; Hershkovitz, Leora; Malcay, Ofir; Kalron, Alon] Tel Aviv Univ, Sch Hlth Profess, Dept Phys Therapy, Sackler Fac Med, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Berkowitz, Shani; Hershkovitz, Leora] Sheba Med Ctr, Multiple Sclerosis Ctr, Tel Hashomer, Israel; [Kalron, Alon] Tel Aviv Univ, Sagol Sch Neurosci, Tel Aviv, Israel";Kalron, A (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Phys Therapy, Sackler Fac Med, Tel Aviv, Israel.;"grinbergjenny@yahoo.com; shanihberkowitz@gmail.com; leoraf@gmail.com; ofirmalcay@yahoo.com; alonkalr@post.tau.ac.il";Kalron, Alon/AAB-3396-2019;Kalron, Alon/0000-0001-7999-0868;;;;38;2;2;1;4;ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD;CLARE;ELSEVIER HOUSE, BROOKVALE PLAZA, EAST PARK SHANNON, CO, CLARE, 00000, IRELAND;0966-6362;1879-2219;;GAIT POSTURE;Gait Posture;MAY;2019;70;;;;;;90;94;;10.1016/j.gaitpost.2019.02.022;;;5;"Neurosciences; Orthopedics; Sport Sciences";"Neurosciences & Neurology; Orthopedics; Sport Sciences";HT6EW;WOS:000464658000016;30831545;;;;2021-03-18;

Some falls result in injuries and the cost associated with their treatment is high. This is a complex problem that requires several steps in order to be tackled. Firstly, it is crucial to develop strategies that recognize the locomotion mode, indicating the state of the subject in various situations. This article aims to develop a strategy capable of identifying normal gait, the pre-fall condition, and the fall situation, based on a wearable system (IMUs-based). This system was used to collect data from healthy subjects that mimicked falls. The strategy consists, essentially, in the construction and use of classifiers as tools for recognizing the locomotion modes. Two approaches were explored. Associative Skill Memories (ASMs) based classifier and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier based on deep learning. Finally, these classifiers were compared, providing for a tool with a good accuracy in recognizing the locomotion modes. Results have shown that the accuracy of the classifiers was quite acceptable. The CNN presented the best results with 92.71% of accuracy considering the pre-fall step different from normal steps, and 100% when not considering.;"[Ribeiro, Nuno Ferrete; Andre, Joao; Santos, Cristina P.] Univ Minho, Ctr MicroElectroMech Syst CMEMS, P-4800058 Guimaraes, Portugal; [Costa, Lino] Univ Minho, Prod & Syst Dept, P-4800058 Guimaraes, Portugal";Ribeiro, NF (corresponding author), Univ Minho, Ctr MicroElectroMech Syst CMEMS, P-4800058 Guimaraes, Portugal.;nuno.ferrete.ribeiro@gmail.com;"Santos, Cristina P/L-8716-2014; Ribeiro, Nuno Ferrete/AAP-9872-2020; Costa, Lino/D-2248-2009";"Santos, Cristina P/0000-0003-0023-7203; Ribeiro, Nuno Ferrete/0000-0003-4177-2587; Costa, Lino/0000-0003-4772-4404";"FCT - Fundacao para a Ciencia e TecnologiaPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [PD/BD/141515/2018]; FEDER funds through the COMPETE 2020 - Programa Operacional Competitividade e Internacionalizacao (POCI); P2020; COMPETE 2020 POCI [POCI-01-0145-FEDER-006941]; Reference Project EML [POCI-01-0247-FEDER-033067]";This work has been supported by the FCT - Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia - with the scholarship reference PD/BD/141515/2018, by the FEDER funds through the COMPETE 2020 - Programa Operacional Competitividade e Internacionalizacao (POCI) and P2020 with the Reference Project EML under Grant POCI-01-0247-FEDER-033067, and through the COMPETE 2020 POCI with the Reference Project under Grant POCI-01-0145-FEDER-006941.;;54;0;1;2;14;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;0148-5598;1573-689X;;J MED SYST;J.

Methods: Adult patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) were interviewed to elicit fatigue-related symptoms and impacts. A draft questionnaire was debriefed in cognitive interviews with further RRMS patients, and revised. Content confirmation interviews were conducted with patients with progressiverelapsing multiple sclerosis (PRMS) and relapsing secondaryprogressive multiple sclerosis (RSPMS). Psychometric analyses used data from adult patients with different RMS subtypes and matched non-RMS controls in a multicenter, observational study. After item reduction, the final instrument was migrated to a smartphone (eDiary) and usability was confirmed in interviews with additional adult RMS patients. Results: The qualitative stage included 37 RRMS, 5 PRMS, and 5 RSPMS patients. Saturation of concepts was reached during concept elicitation. Cognitive interviews confirmed that participants understood the instructions, items, and response options of the instrument-named FSIQ-RMS-as intended. Psychometric validation included 164 RMS and 74 control patients. Internal consistency and test-retest reliability were demonstrated.

They are classified in four classes based on the type of employed transducer: electrochemical, optical, microgravimetric, and thermometric and depending on the type of recognition elements, antibodies, aptamers, microRNAs and recently peptides are integrating parts. Those analytical devices are able to detect peptides, antibodies and proteins in various sample matrices, without many steps of sample pretreatment. Their high sensitivity, low cost and the easy integration in point of care devices assuring portability are attracting features that justify the increasing interest in their development. The use of nanomaterials, simultaneous multianalyte detection and integration on platforms to form point-of-care devices are promising tools that can be used in clinical analysis for early diagnosis and therapy monitoring in several pathologies. Taking into account the growing incidence of autoimmune disease and the importance of early diagnosis, electrochemical biosensors could represent a viable alternative to currently used diagnosis methods.

More sensitive and ecologically valid outcome measures are needed to advance MS research. OBJECTIVES To assess continuous step count activity remotely among individuals with MS for 1 year and determine how average daily step count is associated with other measures of MS disability. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In a prospective longitudinal observational cohort study, 95 adults with relapsing or progressive MS who were able to walk more than 2 minutes with or without an assistive device were recruited between June 15, 2015, and August 8, 2016, and remotely monitored in their natural environment for 1 year. Patients were excluded if they had a clinical relapse within 30 days or comorbidity contributing to ambulatory impairment. Longitudinal analysis was performed from October 2017 to March 2018. Revised analysis was performed in December 2018. INTERVENTION Activity monitoring of step count using a wrist-worn accelerometer. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Average daily step count compared with in-clinic assessments and patient-reported outcomes. RESULTS Of the 95 participants recruited (59 women and 36 men; mean [SD] age, 49.6 [13.6] years [range, 22.0-74.0 years]), 35 (37%) had progressive MS, and the median baseline Expanded Disability Status Scale score was 4.0 (range, 0-6.5). At 1 year, 79 participants completed follow-up (83% retention). There was a modest reduction in accelerometer use during the 1 year of the study. A decreasing average daily step count during the study was associated with worsening of clinic-based outcomes (Timed 25-Foot Walk, ss = -13.09; P<.001; Timed-Up-and-Go, ss = -9.25; P<.001) and patient-reported outcomes (12-item Multiple SclerosisWalking Scale, ss = -17.96; P<.001). A decreasing average daily step count occurred even when the Expanded Disability Status Scale score remained stable, and 12 of 25 participants (48%) with a significant decrease in average daily step count during the study did not have a reduction on other standard clinic-based metrics. Participants with a baseline average daily step count below 4766 (cohort median) had higher odds of clinically meaningful disability (Expanded Disability Status Scale score) worsening at 1 year, adjusting for age, sex, and disease duration (odds ratio, 4.01; 95% CI, 1.17-13.78; P=.03). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Continuous remote activity monitoring of individuals with MS for 1 year appears to be feasible. In this study, a decreasing average daily step count during a 1-year period was associated with worsening of standard ambulatory measures but could also occur even when traditional disability measures remained stable. These results appear to support the prospect of using the average daily step count as a sensitive longitudinal outcome measure in MS and as a clinically relevant metric for targeted intervention.";"[Block, Valerie J.; Bove, Riley; Zhao, Chao; Garcha, Priya; Graves, Jennifer; Romeo, Andrew R.; Green, Ari J.; Hollenbach, Jill A.; Cree, Bruce A.

The strategy involves the preparation and optimisation of neutravidin-coated gold nanospheres (nGNSs) functionalised with a previously biotinylated antibody (Ab) against DNA/RNA hybrids. The Ab guarantees the recognition of any miRNA sequence adsorbed on a surface properly functionalised with different DNA probes; at the same time, gold nanoparticles permit to detect this interaction, thus producing enough SPRi signal even at a low ligand concentration. After a careful optimisation of the nanoenhancer and after its characterisation, the final assay allowed the simultaneous detection of four miRNAs with a limit of detection (LOD) of up to 0.5pM (equal to 275attomoles in 500L) by performing a single enhancing injection. The proposed strategy shows good signal specificity and permits to discriminate wild-type, single- and triple-mutated sequences much better than non-enhanced SPRi. Finally, the method works properlyin complex samples (total RNA extracted from blood) as demonstrated by the detection of four miRNAs potentially related to multiple sclerosis used as case study. This proof-of-concept study confirms that the approach provides the possibility to detect a theoretically unlimited number of miRNAs using a simple protocol and an easily prepared enhancing reagent, and may further facilitate the development of affordable multiplexing miRNA screening for clinical purposes.";"[Sguassero, Andrea; Morasso, Carlo; Gualerzi, Alice; Picciolini, Silvia; Bedoni, Marzia; Gramatica, Furio; Vanna, Renzo] IRCCS Fdn Don Carlo Gnocchi, Lab Nanomed & Clin Biophoton LABION, I-20121 Milan, Italy; [Artiga, Alvaro; Ramirez Jimenez, Rafael; de la Fuente, Jesus M.] Univ Zaragoza, CSIC, Inst Ciencia Mat Aragon, E-50009 Zaragoza, Spain; [Artiga, Alvaro; Ramirez Jimenez, Rafael; de la Fuente, Jesus M.] BBN, CIBER, Ctr Invest Biomed Red Bioengn Biomat & Nanomed, Madrid 28029, Spain; [Martin Rapun, Rafael] Univ Zaragoza, INA, Campus Rio Ebro,Edificio I-D, Zaragoza 50018, Spain; [Mancuso, Roberta; Agostini, Simone; Hernis, Ambra] IRCCS Fdn Don Carlo Gnocchi, Lab Mol Med & Biotechnol, I-20121 Milan, Italy; [Abols, Arturs; Line, Aija] Latvian Biomed Res & Study Ctr, LV-1067 Riga, Latvia; [Picciolini, Silvia] Univ Milano Bicocca, Sch Med & Surg, Nanomed Ctr NANOMIB, I-20900 Monza, Italy; [Rovaris, Marco] IRCCS Fdn Don Carlo Gnocchi, Multiple Sclerosis Unit, I-20121 Milan, Italy; [Vanna, Renzo] IRCCS, Ist Clin Sci Maugeri, Via Maugeri 10, I-27100 Pavia, Italy";"Vanna, R (corresponding author), IRCCS Fdn Don Carlo Gnocchi, Lab Nanomed & Clin Biophoton LABION, I-20121 Milan, Italy.; de la Fuente, JM (corresponding author), Univ Zaragoza, CSIC, Inst Ciencia Mat Aragon, E-50009 Zaragoza, Spain.; de la Fuente, JM (corresponding author), BBN, CIBER, Ctr Invest Biomed Red Bioengn Biomat & Nanomed, Madrid 28029, Spain.; Vanna, R (corresponding author), IRCCS, Ist Clin Sci Maugeri, Via Maugeri 10, I-27100 Pavia, Italy.";"jmfuente@unizar.es; renzo.vanna@icsmaugeri.it";"Rovaris, Marco/AAA-6040-2020; Morasso, Carlo Francesco/V-5532-2017; Vanna, Renzo/K-4670-2016; Agostini, Simone/L-7377-2015; Gualerzi, Alice/F-1045-2011; Mancuso, Roberta/H-8986-2012; Ramirez-Jimenez, Rafael/X-2908-2019; Artiga, Alvaro/N-6606-2019; Artiga, Alvaro/W-3042-2018; Bedoni, Marzia/AAA-7674-2020; de la Fuente, Jesus M/L-8361-2016; Morasso, Carlo Francesco/ABI-2185-2020; Line, Aija/AAH-9999-2021; Martin, Rafael/K-7310-2012; Picciolini, Silvia/J-7423-2018";"Rovaris, Marco/0000-0001-9691-1957; Morasso, Carlo Francesco/0000-0001-9185-0198; Vanna, Renzo/0000-0001-6218-8393; Agostini, Simone/0000-0002-6214-0645; Gualerzi, Alice/0000-0003-2996-5714; Mancuso, Roberta/0000-0002-4449-3623; Ramirez-Jimenez, Rafael/0000-0002-6867-9254; Artiga, Alvaro/0000-0001-9475-6367; Artiga, Alvaro/0000-0001-9475-6367; Bedoni, Marzia/0000-0003-2618-3661; de la Fuente, Jesus M/0000-0003-1081-8482; Morasso, Carlo Francesco/0000-0001-9185-0198; Line, Aija/0000-0002-8492-4758; Ambra, Hernis/0000-0001-9234-6452; Martin, Rafael/0000-0003-0702-8260; Gramatica, Furio/0000-0002-2826-031X; Picciolini, Silvia/0000-0002-7592-0253";"Italian Ministry of HealthMinistry of Health, Italy; DGA-FSE (Diputacion General de Aragon-Fondo Social Europeo); Ministerio de Educacion, Cultura y Deportes of Spanish Government, FPU grantGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [FPU014/06249]";"Research funding was provided by the Italian Ministry of Health within the framework of the European EuroNanoMedII Project (Call 2015) entitled NanoPlasmiRNA; DGA-FSE (Diputacion General de Aragon-Fondo Social Europeo); Ministerio de Educacion, Cultura y Deportes of Spanish Government, FPU grant (FPU014/06249).";;41;11;11;4;37;SPRINGER HEIDELBERG;HEIDELBERG;TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY;1618-2642;1618-2650;;ANAL BIOANAL CHEM;Anal.

We conducted two laboratory studies with 12 participants without disabilities and a field study with four participants with multiple sclerosis (MS). The first laboratory study was done to test the robustness and to count with a base to compare the results of the evaluation done with the participants with MS. Once observed the results of the participants with disabilities, we conducted a new laboratory study with participants without disabilities simulating the limitations of the users with MS to tune the system. All participants completed a set of defined tasks: pointing and pointing-selecting. We logged use and conducted questionnaires post-experiment. Our results showed positive outcomes using the system as an input device, although apps should follow a set of recommendations on the size of the targets and their position to facilitate the interaction with mobile devices for motion-impaired users.

They are not only able to informon the evolution of diseases but also to predict some illnesses well in advance. Currently, the evaluation of the number and type of formed AAbs is employed to assess the risk, rate, severity and progression of autoimmune and cancer diseases, and to help find therapies to prevent or mitigate the impact of these illnesses. Conventional methods for the determination of AAbs generally suffer from low sensitivity, time-consuming and laborious methodologies, and need specialized technicians and well-equipped labs. Consequently, seeking new methodologies for the rapid and low-cost screening of AAbs is of great interest for global health because it would shorten the delay between sample collection and diagnosis and improve the introduction of modern diagnostics into the developing world. Electrochemical biosensors are considered as a promising alternative to conventional techniques for the determination of clinical biomarkers due to their simplicity of use, low cost, high sensitivity, multiplexing abilities or compatibility with microfabrication and point of care testing. This review is focused on the critical discussion of selected electrochemical biosensors described to date for the determination of AAbs related to autoimmune diseases and several types of cancer.

This requires a wearable and unobtrusive system capable of estimating ambulatory gait and balance measures, such as the extrapolated center of mass (XCoM) and dynamic margin of stability. These estimations require the knowledge of 3-D forces and moments (F&M) and accurate foot positions. Though an existing ambulatory gait and balance system (AGBS) consisting of 3-D F&M sensors and inertial measurement units can be used for the purpose, it is bulky and conspicuous. Resistive pressure sensors were investigated as an alternative to the onboard 3-D F&M sensors. Subject-specific regression models were built to estimate 3-D F&M from 1-D plantar pressures. The model was applicable for different walking speeds. Different pressure sensor configurations were studied to optimize the system complexity and accuracy. Using resistive sensors only under the toe and heel, we were able to estimate the XCoM with a mean absolute rms error of 2.2 +/- 0.3 cm in the walking direction while walking at a preferred speed, when compared to the AGBS. For the same case, the XCoM was classified as ahead or behind the base of support correctly at 97.7 +/- 1.7%. In conclusion, this paper shows that pressure sensors, minimally under the heel and toe, offer a lightweight and inconspicuous alternative for F&M sensing, toward estimating ambulatory gait and dynamic balance.;"[Refai, Mohamed Irfan Mohamed; van Beijnum, Bert-Jan F.; Buurke, Jaap H.; Veltink, Peter H.] Univ Twente, Dept Biomed Signals & Syst, NL-7522 NB Enschede, Netherlands; [Buurke, Jaap H.] Roessingh Res & Dev, NL-7522 AH Enschede, Netherlands";Refai, MIM (corresponding author), Univ Twente, Dept Biomed Signals & Syst, NL-7522 NB Enschede, Netherlands.;m.i.mohamedrefai@utwente.nl;;Mohamed Refai, Mohamed Irfan/0000-0002-3617-5131;Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) through the Perspectief programme NeuroCIMT [14905];This work was supported in part by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) through the Perspectief programme NeuroCIMT under Project 14905.;;27;15;15;5;24;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;1534-4320;1558-0210;;IEEE T NEUR SYS REH;IEEE Trans.

We investigated how and in which measure a system based on wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs) can provide an objective support to the diagnosis of motor impairments in school-aged children. The IMUs measured linear and rotational movements of 37 schoolchildren, 7-10yo, 17 patients and 20 control subjects, during the execution of motor exercises, performed under medical and psychiatric supervision, to assess different aspects of the motor coordination. The measured motor parameters showed a high degree of significance in discriminating the ADHD/DCD patients from the healthy subjects, pointing out which motor tasks are worth focusing on. So, medical doctors have a novel key lecture to state a diagnosis, gaining in objectivity with respect to the standard procedures which mainly involve subjective human judgment. Differently to other works, we propose a novel approach in terms of number of used IMUs and of performed motor tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate the meaningful parameters to be considered as more discriminant in supporting the medical diagnosis. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Inertial measurement units (IMUs) are small, light wearable sensors that can be used in routine neurological practice. InertiaLocoGraphy (ILG), the quantification of gait with IMUs, has proven useful to detect early changes in MS undetectable with standard stopwatch-timed measures. Still, whether such markers are useful for evaluating the severity of the disease remains unknown. Therefore, the correlation between ILG and disease progression would be worth exploring. Methods: We will search MEDLINE via PubMed, Cochrane, and EMBASE electronic databases to identify articles published before May 2, 2018 that measure gait using IMUs in MS patients. In addition, grey literature will be searched. Inclusion criteria will be adults with a clinical diagnosis of MS and gait measured by using inertial sensors. We will exclude from the meta-analysis articles that do not provide sufficient data for evaluating the correlations between ILG parameters and disease severity as measured by at least one of the six following tests: the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), the Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale-12 (MSWS), the Multiple Sclerosis Severity Score (MSSS), the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29), the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC), and the Timed 25-ft Walk Test (T25FW). Extracted data from included articles will be presented descriptively, and effect sizes will be computed based on the recommendations from the Cochrane Collaboration handbook and RevMan software. Discussion: Identifying changes in disease state throughout the course of MS is essential for optimal care. Current clinical and performance tests allow for identifying advanced gait alteration but lack sensitivity to detect subtle gait change. IMUs can be easily used in clinical practice to quantify gait in MS patients. Nevertheless, whether these outcomes are clinically relevant is uncertain because no study has evaluated their correlation with disease severity across different settings. This systematic review and meta-analysis would bring insight into the potential of this outcome as a marker of disease evolution.;"[Vienne-Jumeau, A.; Quijoux, F.; Vidal, P.

Their abilities to perform tasks can be improved through vigorous physical therapy. When that therapy is either not effective or lacking in its progression an assistive robotic device can be used to improve patients' quality of life and help them in accomplishing ADL's. This study presents implementation of an EMG controlled assistive robotic arm to aid patients with upper limb mobility limitations. Using the MYO armband, EMG signals were obtained from three healthy human test subjects and were analyzed in MATLAB (R) Simulink (R) Post signal acquisition, signals were classified to be used as inputs for a Kinova MICO 6 DOF manipulator. Trajectories are planned based on the user EMG signals and robot position data obtained from the Polhemus 6D motion tracker, an IMU-type sensor, which automatically provide position and orientation data. An inverse dynamics controller is developed to drive the robot joints accordingly. Results have shown that the classification accuracy of the EMG signals to control commands for the robot was greater than 90%. The classification accuracy was achieved through the use of a pattern recognition neural network.

However, methods based on the extraction of signals features may deteriorate their accuracy when applied to very slow walkers with abnormal gait patterns. The aim of this study is to test and validate an innovative step counter method (DiSC) based on the direct measurement of inter-leg distance. Data were recorded using an innovative wearable system which integrates a magneto-inertial unit and multiple distance sensors (DSs) attached to the shank. The method allowed for the detection of both left and right steps using a single device and was validated on thirteen people affected by multiple sclerosis (0 < EDSS < 6.5) while performing a six-minute walking test. Two different measurement ranges for the distance sensor were tested (DS200: 0-200 mm; DS400: 0-400 mm). Accuracy was evaluated by comparing the estimates of the DiSC method against video recordings used as gold standard. Preliminary results showed a good accuracy in detecting steps with half the errors in detecting the step of the instrumented side compared to the non-instrumented (mean absolute percentage error 2.4% vs 4.8% for DS200; mean absolute percentage error 2% vs 5.4% for DS400). When averaging errors across patients, over and under estimation errors were compensated, and very high accuracy was achieved (E-%<1.2% for DS200; E-%<0.7% for DS400).

Examples of diseases that can change normal gait for a pathological gait are Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy and other. One of the directions of studying this problem is the use of image analysis systems but continuous development of mobile technologies and machine learning techniques allows the use of human motion recognition, including human gait, using sensors in smartphones, such as accelerometer and gyroscope.

Unfortunately, not only elder people face these issues. Neurorehabilitation is an elaborate medical specialty, which has the goal of helping people who suffer from neurological disorders recover their lost capabilities. Restoring limb control, walking, or balance are needed to assure motoric independence, while speech and psychological therapy are essential for an efficient neurorehabilitation process. However, neurorehabilitation training can become extremely costly and its accessibility might be restrained, giving the fact that existing therapists are often insufficient for the increasing number of sufferers. Furthermore, therapy expenses are usually free of charge only for a limited time period, while neurological conditions need an intensive, durable process of rehabilitation in order to show significant improvements. Individuals who see their life changing dramatically after suffering the neurological condition need to be trained and educated constantly in order to see an amelioration in their quality of life. Therefore cheaper, more accessible and flexible assistive solutions are needed. Over the past years, technology has started to play a significant role in the development of medical devices and therapies. Virtual reality, an emerging technology which has the capacity of reproducing a great variety of real-life environments and situations, is gaining more and more ground and is proven to be successful even for neurorehabilitation. We propose an innovative concept of an assistive device for neurorehabilitation training, which combines various technologies such as virtual environments, head-mounted devices, movement tracking, biosensors, emotion recognition and stress control. The system focuses on the creation of various virtual scenes where patients can relearn their lost capacities or retrain specific motions by accomplishing different training exercises. The system concentrates on four essential neurological conditions: stroke, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease and trauma of the central nervous system. Two subsystems are included: one for educating patients with neurological conditions and a second one for training medical therapists involved in the neurorehabilitation process. The main goal is to create a highly modularized system, which can be easily extended with a larger variety of exercises, suitable for a wide range of neurological conditions. We claim that our system would be suitable both for training people with neuro-motor disabilities, but also medical personnel involved in their recovery and medical students who learn recovery techniques.;"[Stanica, I.

This assessment was realised using cognitive tests (assessing memory, attention, reaction time, information processing speed and executive function), self-assessment, contextual factors and facial feature analysis. This study also investigated the use of an ensemble algorithm for the classification of cognitive fatigue utilising facial features and a Rotation Forest approach. Self-assessment of cognitive fatigue was shown to directly correlate with reaction time through a Psychomotor Vigilance Task (r = .643, p = .001), and self-reported increases in the level of social activity (r = .377, p = .001). Facial feature analysis revealed dominant emotions of sadness and anger when participants were cognitively fatigued. It also revealed underlying facial cues that indicated higher levels of cognitive fatigue including expressions of negative valence, and Facial Action Coding System units of increased brow furrow, eyelid tightening and lip suck. In addition, a Principle Component Analysis based Rotation Forest ensemble with a ternary output demonstrated a cognitive fatigue classification accuracy of 82.17%. The findings presented indicate that the inclusion of data relating to surrounding cognitive, social, physical and emotional factors can improve the accuracy of mobile in-situ cognitive fatigue assessment using our previously validated smartphone-based cognitive fatigue assessment approach. The findings further suggest gross-level fatigue status may be potentially classified to a reasonable degree of accuracy using facial features, which may give rise to personalised in-situ fatigue detection.;"[Price, Edward; Moore, George; Galway, Leo] Ulster Univ, Sch Comp, Newtownabbey BT37 0QB, North Ireland; [Linden, Mark] Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Nursing & Midwifery, Belfast BT9 7BL, Antrim, North Ireland";Moore, G (corresponding author), Ulster Univ, Sch Comp, Newtownabbey BT37 0QB, North Ireland.;g.moore@ulster.ac.uk;;"Moore, George/0000-0003-1623-0014; Linden, Mark/0000-0002-3832-4102";"Department for Learning and Employment Northern Ireland; School of Computing, Ulster University";This work was supported by the Department for Learning and Employment Northern Ireland and the School of Computing, Ulster University.;;73;0;0;0;3;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;2169-3536;;;IEEE ACCESS;IEEE Access;;2019;7;;;;;;116465;116479;;10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2935540;;;15;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications";"Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications";IV4HD;WOS:000484233300005;;DOAJ Gold, Green Published;;;2021-03-18;

However, it is unclear how physical activity and symptoms correlate on a day-to-day basis in persons with MS. Purpose To determine the temporal within-person associations of pain, fatigue, depressed mood, and perceived cognitive function with physical activity in MS. Methods Ambulatory adults with MS (N = 107) completed 7 days of home monitoring. Continuous physical activity data (assessed via wrist-worn accelerometer) and concurrent ecological momentary assessment (5X/day) of pain, fatigue, depressed mood, and perceived cognitive function were collected. Data were analyzed using multilevel mixed modeling. Results Fatigue and depressed mood demonstrated bidirectional associations with physical activity, whereas pain and cognitive function did not. Higher than usual fatigue (B = -5.83, p = .001) and depressed mood (B = -4.12, p = .03) were followed by decreased physical activity. In contrast, higher than usual physical activity was associated with subsequent decline in fatigue (B = -0.001, p = .02) and depressed mood (B = -0.0007, p = .02); however, the association between physical activity and fatigue varied across the day. Conclusions Physical activity is dynamically related to fatigue and mood on a moment-to-moment basis in MS. Efforts to increase physical activity in MS must incorporate a focus on how symptoms affect and are affected by activity.";"[Kratz, Anna L.; Murphy, Susan L.] Univ Michigan, Dept Phys Med & Rehabil, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Fritz, Nora E.] Wayne State Univ, Program Phys Therapy, Detroit, MI USA; [Fritz, Nora E.] Wayne State Univ, Dept Neurol, Detroit, MI USA; [Braley, Tiffany J.] Univ Michigan, Dept Neurol, Ann Arbor, MI USA; [Scott, Eric L.; Foxen-Craft, Emily] Univ Michigan, Dept Pediat & Communicable Dis, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Scott, Eric L.] Univ Michigan, Dept Anesthesiol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Murphy, Susan L.] VA Ann Arbor Hlth Care Syst GRECC, Ann Arbor, MI USA";Kratz, AL (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Phys Med & Rehabil, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.;alkratz@med.umich.edu;Fritz, Nora/ABG-6696-2020;;"National Institute of Nursing Research of the National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR) [R03NR014515]; National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin DiseasesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Arthritis & Musculoskeletal & Skin Diseases (NIAMS) [1K01AR064275]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ARTHRITIS AND MUSCULOSKELETAL AND SKIN DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Arthritis & Musculoskeletal & Skin Diseases (NIAMS) [K01AR064275, K01AR064275, K01AR064275] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER";"Research reported in this publication was supported by the National Institute of Nursing Research of the National Institutes of Health under award number R03NR014515; PI: Kratz.

It is unknown what demographic and clinical characteristics are associated with use of eHealth technologies in MS. As these technologies are more widely adopted in health settings, it is important that health care providers understand who is using them, and to recognize potential disparities if they exist. Objective: We aimed to examine the use of eHealth technologies among persons with multiple sclerosis (MS), including the adoption of mobile Health (mHealth) applications (apps) and telehealth, perceived benefits of using mHealth apps, and sociodemographic and clinical characteristics associated with use of these technologies. Methods: In the spring 2017, we surveyed participants in the North American Research Committee on Multiple Sclerosis (NARCOMS) Registry about their use of eHealth technologies using questions adapted from the Health Information National Trends (HINTS) 4 Cycle 4 survey. Participants reported their internet use, electronic devices used, use of health related software apps and perceived benefits from using those apps, and their interest in exchanging medical information with a health care professional electronically. We used descriptive statistics to report use of eHealth technologies and multivariable logistic regression to evaluate factors associated with use of electronic devices, use of mHealth apps, telehealth use, and perceived benefits of using mHealth apps. Results: Of 6423 participants included in the analysis most participants were female, and white, with a mean (SD) age of 59.7 (10.1) years. Overall, 5408 (84.2%) had exchanged medical information with a health professional most often using a secure online portal (1839, 28.6%), followed by email (1327, 20.7%). of the 5529 smartphone and tablet users, 2556 (46.2%) used a mHealth app. Factors associated with a higher likelihood of reporting use of smartphones or tablets, mHealth apps and with perceived benefits of using these apps included online survey response, younger age, having comorbidities, and higher income and education levels. Conclusion: Use of eHealth technologies is common in the MS population and facilitates the exchange of health care information with providers. Use of mHealth apps is perceived to have health benefits. However, use of eHealth and mHealth technologies varies substantially with sociodemographic factors, and health care providers need to be aware of these disparities as these technologies are increasingly leveraged in health care settings.;"[Marrie, Ruth Ann] Univ Manitoba, Dept Internal Med, Max Rady Coll Med, Rady Fac Hlth Sci, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; [Marrie, Ruth Ann; Leung, Stella] Univ Manitoba, Rady Fac Hlth Sci, Max Rady Coll Med, Dept Community Hlth Sci, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; [Tyry, Tuula] St Josephs Hosp, Dign Hlth, Phoenix, AZ USA; [Cutter, Gary R.] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Biostat, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; [Fox, Robert] Cleveland Clin, Neurol Inst, Mellen Ctr Multiple Sclerosis, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Salter, Amber] Washington Univ, Dept Biostat, St Louis, MO USA";Marrie, RA (corresponding author), Univ Manitoba, Dept Internal Med, Max Rady Coll Med, Rady Fac Hlth Sci, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.;rmarrie@hsc.mb.ca;;Marrie, Ruth Ann/0000-0002-1855-5595;"CMSC; Foundation of the CMSC; Waugh Family Chair in Multiple Sclerosis; Research Manitoba Chair";NARCOMS is a project of the Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers (CMSC).

To carry out a systematic review about the information related to mobile applications specifically designed in the field of MS, in order to classify them and carry out a description of their main characteristics. Subjects and methods. A literature search of articles published in English and Spanish has been carried out from 2012 until 2017 that presents, analyzes and validates a system based on an application with utility or specific design for MS. In turn, a search for mobile applications has been conducted in mobile application markets. Results. A total of 46 mobile applications were found in the field of MS, classified as 19 information apps, 3 assessment apps, 4 treatment apps, 6 communication apps and 14 were considered combined. Four apps had costs and 37 were only found in English. Conclusions. All papers included in this systematic review showed mobile applications designed specifically for MS, but the low methodological quality of the articles included and the fact that there are no coincidences between the apps found in the scientific literature and in the apps markets mean that their use could not be recommended in a generalized way.;"[Zayas-Garcia, Sandra; Cano-de-la-Cuerda, Roberto] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Fac Ciencias Salud, Dept Fisioterapia Terapia Ocupac Rehabil & Med Fi, Madrid, Spain";Cano-de-la-Cuerda, R (corresponding author), Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Fac Ciencias Salud, Dept Fisioterapia Terapia Ocupac Rehabil & Med Fi, Avda Atenas S-N, E-28922 Alcorcon, Madrid, Spain.;roberto.cano@urjc.es;de la Cuerda, Roberto Cano/ABF-6438-2020;de la Cuerda, Roberto Cano/0000-0002-1118-4234;;;;44;1;1;0;4;REVISTA DE NEUROLOGIA;BARCELONA;C/O CESAR VIGUERA, EDITOR, APDO 94121, 08080 BARCELONA, SPAIN;0210-0010;1576-6578;;REV NEUROLOGIA;Rev.

The present study determines in detail whether disease-related physical, cognitive or psychosocial impairments contribute to the reporting rate of subjective self-report travel diaries and objective GPS tracking devices, besides socio-demographic and trip-related characteristics. The reporting rate of both data collection methods was analyzed in 108 persons with Multiple Sclerosis with various disability severities during a seven-day data collection period. The results demonstrated that there was only limited influence of disease-related dysfunctions on the reporting rate of both data collection methods, as well as only limited significant differences between subgroups with various disability severity. Overall, the data quality of the diary was higher than the quality of the GPS data: 66% of the trips were reported in both data collection methods, while overall more than one fifth of all trips were forgotten and not registered by GPS, and 11% were forgotten and not reported in the diary. Self-report travel diaries seemed to be more suitable for persons with a higher disability severity, as these persons more often forgot to take their GPS device with them when making a trip because of several organiza-tional issues related to their mobility limitations.;"[Neven, An; Wets, Geert; Janssens, Davy] Hasselt Univ, Transportat Res Inst IMOB, Diepenbeek, Belgium; [De Schutter, Ine] Hasselt Univ, Diepenbeek, Belgium; [Feys, Peter] Hasselt Univ, REVAL Rehabil Res Inst, BIOMED Biomed Res Inst, Fac Med & Life Sci, Diepenbeek, Belgium";Neven, A (corresponding author), Hasselt Univ, Transportat Res Inst IMOB, Diepenbeek, Belgium.;An.Neven@uhasselt.be;;;;;;39;1;1;0;0;SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC;THOUSAND OAKS;2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA;0361-1981;2169-4052;;TRANSPORT RES REC;Transp.

In this article, we take a step further in gait analysis and provide a methodology for predicting the movements of the legs, which can be applied in prosthesis to imitate the missing part of the leg in walking. In particular, we propose a method, called GaIn, to control non-invasive, robotic, prosthetic legs. GaIn can infer the movements of both missing shanks and feet for humans suffering from double trans-femoral amputation using biologically inspired recurrent neural networks. Predictions are performed for casual walking related activities such as walking, taking stairs, and running based on thigh movement. In our experimental tests, GaIn achieved a 4.55 degrees prediction error for shank movements on average. However, a patient's intention to stand up and sit down cannot be inferred from thigh movements. In fact, intention causes thigh movements while the shanks and feet remain roughly still. The GaIn system can be triggered by thigh muscle activities measured with electromyography (EMG) sensors to make robotic prosthetic legs perform standing up and sitting down actions. The GaIn system has low prediction latency and is fast and computationally inexpensive to be deployed on mobile platforms and portable devices.;"[Chereshnev, Roman; Kertesz-Farkas, Attila] Natl Res Univ Higher Sch Econ, Dept Data Anal & Artificial Intelligence, Fac Comp Sci, 20 Myasnitskaya Ulitsa, Moscow 101000, Russia";Kertesz-Farkas, A (corresponding author), Natl Res Univ Higher Sch Econ, Dept Data Anal & Artificial Intelligence, Fac Comp Sci, 20 Myasnitskaya Ulitsa, Moscow 101000, Russia.;"rchereshnev@hse.ru; akerteszfarkas@hse.ru";Chereshnev, Roman/O-5486-2015;;;;;53;3;3;0;13;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;1424-8220;;;SENSORS-BASEL;Sensors;DEC;2018;18;12;;;;;;;4146;10.3390/s18124146;;;20;"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation";"Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation";HG2TJ;WOS:000454817100065;30486308;DOAJ Gold, Green Published;;;2021-03-18;

This task is usually assessed with clinical scales suffering from partial subjectivity and limited detail in evaluating different task aspects. In this paper, we instrumented the assessment of stair ascent in people with multiple sclerosis (MS), stroke (ST), and Parkinson's disease (PD) to analyze the validity of the proposed quantitative indexes and characterize subjects' performances. Participants climbed 10 steps wearing a magneto-inertial sensor [magneto-inertial measurement unit (MIMU)] at sternum level. Gait pattern features (step frequency, symmetry, regularity, and harmonic ratios), and upper trunk sway were computed from MIMU signals. Clinical modified dynamic gait index (mDGI) and mDGI-Item 8 Up stairs were administered. Significant correlations with clinical scores were found for gait pattern features (r(s) >= 0.536) and trunk pitch sway (r(s) <= -0.367) demonstrating their validity. Instrumental indexes showed alterations in the three pathological groups compared to healthy subjects and significant differences, not clinically detected, among MS, ST, and PD. MS showed the worst performance, with alterations of all gait pattern aspects and larger trunk pitch sway. ST showed worsening in gait pattern features but not in trunk motion. PD showed fewer alterations consisting in reduced step frequency and trunk yaw sway. These results suggest that the use of an MIMU provided valid objective indexes revealing between-group differences in stair ascent not detected by clinical scales. Importantly, the indexes include upper trunk measures, usually not present in clinical tests, and provide relevant hints for tailored rehabilitation.;"[Carpinella, Ilaria; Gervasoni, Elisa; Anastasi, Denise; Lencioni, Tiziana; Cattaneo, Davide; Ferrarin, Maurizio] IRCCS Fdn Don Carlo Gnocchi, I-20148 Milan, Italy";Cattaneo, D (corresponding author), IRCCS Fdn Don Carlo Gnocchi, I-20148 Milan, Italy.;dcattaneo@dongnocchi.it;"Ferrarin, Maurizio/I-3230-2012; Gervasoni, Elisa/J-1723-2018; Carpinella, Ilaria/K-1572-2016";"Ferrarin, Maurizio/0000-0002-7797-2399; Cattaneo, Davide/0000-0003-4251-1856; Gervasoni, Elisa/0000-0002-6057-591X; Carpinella, Ilaria/0000-0001-7486-0706; Lencioni, Tiziana/0000-0003-3821-6256";Italian Ministry of Health (Ricerca Corrente)Ministry of Health, Italy;This work was supported by the Italian Ministry of Health (Ricerca Corrente).;;53;8;8;1;12;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;1534-4320;1558-0210;;IEEE T NEUR SYS REH;IEEE Trans.

The study included 30 PwMS, mean disease duration 11.8 (SD=6.8) years, and 15 healthy controls. The investigation included a cognitive assessment; texting assessment based on 100 typed characters; and gait assessment under two different conditions: normal walking and walking while texting. Outcome measures included the Symbol Digit Modalities Test to assess cognition. Texting measures included accuracy (%) and duration(s). Gait was assessed with axial accelerometers to quantify temporal measures. The dual-task cost percentage for the walking tests and texting accuracy was determined by calculating the percentage change from a single task to a double task. The impact of texting while walking on gait measures was significantly higher in PwMS; furthermore, texting was less accurate compared to the healthy controls. The dual-task cost for texting accuracy in the PwMS group was 153.3 (SD=105.7) compared to 8.9 (SD=26.6) in the healthy group. A significant association was found solely in the PwMS group between cognition and texting accuracy while in a sitting position (R-2=0.564) and while walking (R-2=0.534).

Methods Cross-sectional analysis of accelerometry (7 days) and research protocol MRI data from 12 pediatric MS and 18 children with monophasic ADS (monoADS). Total brain and DGv were quantified using standardized methods. The association of daily minutes of MVPA with normalized DGv (nDGv) was assessed using multivariable generalized linear models. Results Median (interquartile range) MVPA was lower in MS patients [9.5 (14)] and exhibited less variation than in monoADS patients [24.5 (47)]. nDGv did not differ significantly between groups [mean nDGv (SD) [cm(3)]: MS 0.34 (0.1); monoADS 0.4 (0.1); p = 0.100]. In the monoADS group, every 1-minute increase in MVPA was associated with a 2.4-mm(3) increase in nDGv (p = 0.0017), an association that was independent of age at incident demyelination, time from incident demyelination, sex, and brain white matter T2 lesion volume. No significant association was found between MVPA and nDGv (-2.6 mm(3)/min, p = 0.16) in the MS group. Conclusions Higher MVPA associates with greater nDGv in children who have recovered from monophasic demyelination. Larger studies are required to determine whether MVPA can promote regional brain development, or limit tissue damage, in youth with MS.";"[Longoni, Giulia; Grover, Stephanie A.; Yeh, E.

MMP-9 can cleave many extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins to regulate ECM remodeling. It can also cleave many plasma surface proteins to release them from the cell surface. MMP-9 has been widely found to relate to the pathology of cancers, including but not limited to invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis. Some recent research evaluated the value of MMP-9 as biomarkers to various specific cancers. Besides, recent research of MMP-9 biosensors discovered various novel MMP-9 biosensors to detect this enzyme. In this review, some recent advances in exploring MMP-9 as a biomarker in different cancers are summarized, and recent discoveries of novel MMP-9 biosensors are also presented.;"[Huang, Hao] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Pediat Oncol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Huang, Hao] Harvard Med Sch, Dept Pediat, Boston, MA 02115 USA";"Huang, H (corresponding author), Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Pediat Oncol, Boston, MA 02215 USA.; Huang, H (corresponding author), Harvard Med Sch, Dept Pediat, Boston, MA 02115 USA.";hao_huang@dfci.harvard.edu;;;Team Path to the Cure grant;The author gratefully acknowledges Rani E.

With the development of light, low-cost wearable technology, inertia-based fall detection has gained much attention. However, some large movements, such as jumping and postural changes, are frequently confounded with falls. For example, commonly used fall detection methods based on acceleration amplitude produce a large number of false alerts unless they are combined with post-fall posture identification. In this paper, we propose two new inertial parameters to improve the selectivity of threshold-based fall detection methods, and evaluate strategies to distinguish falls from other activities of daily life (ADLs). Approach: We define two new inertial parameters, acceleration cubic-product-root magnitude (ACM) and angular velocity cubicproduct-root magnitude (AVCM). Along with acceleration magnitude (AM), we test threshold-based fall detection methods based on single parameters and combinations. We collected inertial data on four types of simulated falls and eight types of ADLs from a study with 15 participants wearing a chest-mounted sensor with accelerometer and gyroscope. Two public datasets, UMAFall and Cognent Labs, were also included to evaluate fall detection methods. Main results: We chose the detection threshold with 99% sensitivity and the best possible specificity. The hybrid of AM, ACM and AVCM method had a lower rate of misclassification than single-parameter methods. Leave-oneout cross-validation shows that the hybrid fall detection method can achieve both high specificity and high sensitivity.

The Timed-Up-And-Go (TUG) task is used to assess patient mobility because it incorporates clinically-relevant submovements during standing. Most sensor-based TUG research has focused on the placement of sensors at the spine, hip or ankles; an examination of thigh activity in TUG in multiple sclerosis is wanting. Methods: We used validated sensors (x-IMU by x-io) to derive transparent metrics for the sit-to-stand (SI-ST) transition and the stand-to-sit (ST-SI) transition of TUG, and compared effect sizes for metrics from inertial sensors on the thighs to effect sizes for metrics from a sensor placed at the L3 level of the lumbar spine. Twenty-three healthy volunteers were compared to 17 ambulatory persons with MS (PwMS, HAI <= 2). Results: During the SI-ST transition, the metric with the largest effect size comparing healthy volunteers to PwMS was the Area Under the Curve of the thigh angular velocity in the pitch direction-representing both thigh and knee extension; the peak of the spine pitch angular velocity during SI-ST also had a large effect size, as did some temporal measures of duration of SI-ST, although less so. During the ST-SI transition the metric with the largest effect size in PWMS was the peak of the spine angular velocity curve in the roll direction. A regression was performed. Discussion: We propose for PWMS that the diminished peak angular velocity during SI-ST directly represents extensor weakness, while the increased roll during ST-SI represents diminished postural control. Conclusions: During the SI-ST transition of TUG, angular velocities can discriminate between healthy volunteers and ambulatory PwMS better than temporal features. Sensor placement on the thighs provides additional discrimination compared to sensor placement at the lumbar spine.";"[Witchel, Harry J.; Guppy, Joseph H.; Bush, Jake] Univ Sussex, Brighton & Sussex Med Sch, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Oberndorfer, Caecilia; Barth, Jens; Eskofier, Bjoern M.] Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen NOmberg, Erlangen, Germany; [Needham, Robert; Healy, Aoife; Chockalingam, Nachiappan] Staffordshire Univ, Ctr Biomech & Rehabil Technol, Stoke On Trent, Staffs, England; [Westling, Carina E., I] Univ Sussex, Sch Media Film & Mus, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Herberz, Chantal] ASTRUM IT GmbH, Erlangen, Germany; [Roggen, Daniel] Univ Sussex, Dept Engn & Design, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Rashid, Waciar] Hurstwood Pk Neurosci Ctr, Haywards Heath, England; [Klucken, Jochen] Univ Klinikum Erlangen, Mol Neurol, Erlangen, Germany";Witchel, HJ (corresponding author), Univ Sussex, Brighton & Sussex Med Sch, Brighton, E Sussex, England.;h.witchel@bsms.ac.uk;"Chockalingam, Nachiappan/C-4423-2014; Westling, Carina/AAA-4857-2020; Healy, Aoife/F-5911-2013";"Chockalingam, Nachiappan/0000-0002-7072-1271; Westling, Carina/0000-0002-6549-0974; Roggen, Daniel/0000-0001-8033-6417; Healy, Aoife/0000-0002-4948-6086";"DAADDeutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)European Commission; JaB";The DAAD funded travel and masters studies for CO.

We hypothesized that aggregating data from two simple smartphone tests of fine finger movements with differing contribution of specific neurological domains (i.e., strength & cerebellar functions, vision, and reaction time) will allow establishment of secondary outcomes that reflect domain-specific deficit. This hypothesis was tested by assessing correlations of smartphone-derived outcomes with relevant parts of neurological examination in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. We developed MS test suite on Android platform, consisting of several simple functional tests. This paper compares cross-sectional and longitudinal performance of Finger tapping and Balloon popping tests by 76MS patients and 19 healthy volunteers (HV). The primary outcomes of smartphone tests, the average number of taps (per two 10-s intervals) and the average number of pops (per two 26-s intervals) differentiated MS from HV with similar power to traditional, investigator-administered test of fine finger movements, 9-hole peg test (9HPT). Additionally, the secondary outcomes identified patients with predominant cerebellar dysfunction, motor fatigue and poor eye-hand coordination and/or reaction time, as evidenced by significant correlations between these derived outcomes and relevant parts of neurological examination. The intra-individual variance in longitudinal sampling was low. In the time necessary for performing 9HPT, smartphone tests provide much richer and reliable measurements of several distinct neurological functions. These data suggest that combing more creatively-construed smartphone apps may one day recreate the entire neurological examination.;"[Boukhvalova, Alexandra K.; Kowalczyk, Emily; Harris, Thomas; Kosa, Peter; Wichman, Alison; Sandford, Mary A.; Bielekova, Bibiana] NIAID, Lab Clin Immunol & Microbiol, Neuroimmunol Dis Sect, NIH, 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Kowalczyk, Emily; Memon, Atif] Univ Maryland, Dept Comp Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA";Bielekova, B (corresponding author), NIAID, Lab Clin Immunol & Microbiol, Neuroimmunol Dis Sect, NIH, 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.;bibi.bielekova@nih.gov;"Bielekova, Bibiana/V-1452-2017; Bielekova, Bibiana/AAA-8115-2020";"Bielekova, Bibiana/0000-0002-0959-9430; Bielekova, Bibiana/0000-0002-0959-9430; Boukhvalova, Alexandra/0000-0001-6458-1180";"NIAID Division of Intramural ResearchUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [ZIAAI001243] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER";This project was supported in part by the NIAID Division of Intramural Research.

The aim of this exploratory study was to examine interdependence in the physical activity (PA) patterns of dyads affected by moderate to severe MS disability. Method: A total of 15 pairs of PwMS and their family caregivers wore accelerometers for 7 days. By collecting data simultaneously from both partners, we tested interdependence using the dyad as the unit of analysis. Results: PwMS and caregivers averaged 4,091.3 (SD 2,726.3) and 6,160.2 (SD 1,653.0) steps per day, respectively. The mean number of minutes per day of sedentary, light, and moderate to vigorous activity for PwMS was 566.3 (SD 97.7), 167.4 (SD 94.0), and 7.6 (SD 12.4), respectively, and 551.9 (SD 92.4), 199.6 (SD 63.4), and 21.4 (SD 18.2), respectively, for caregivers. Interdependence between dyads for sedentary, light, moderate to vigorous activity, and step count was low and non-significant (rs=0.20, 0.26, 0.13, and -0.27, respectively; p>0.05). Conclusions: Although our findings do not support the interdependence of PA between caregivers and care recipients with MS, they do show that both partners are not engaging in sufficient PA to achieve important health benefits.

Methods: Balance control during stance and gait tasks of 24 remitting-phase patients (mean age 43.7 +/- 10.5, 15 women, mean EDSS at baseline 2.45 +/- 1.01) was examined every 3 months over 9 months and compared to that of nine relapsing patients (age 42.0 +/- 12.7, all women, mean EDSS at relapse onset 3.11 +/- 0.96) examined at relapse onset and 3 months later. Balance was also compared to that of 40 healthy controls (HCs) (age 39.7 +/- 12.6, 25 women). Balance control was measured as lower-trunk sway angles with body-worn gyroscopes. Expanded Disability Status Scale scores (EDSS) were used to monitor, clinically, disease progression. Results: Remitting-phase patients showed more unstable stance balance control than HCs (p < 0.04) with no worsening over the observation period of 9 months. Gait balance control was normal (p > 0.06). Relapsing patients had stance balance control significantly worse at onset compared to remitting-phase patients and HCs (p < 0.04). Gait tasks showed a significant decrease of gait speed and trunk sway in relapsing patients (p = 0.018) compatible with having increased gait instability at normal speeds. Improvement to levels of remitting patients generally took longer than 3 months. Balance and EDSS scores were correlated for remitting but not for relapse patients. Conclusions: Balance in remitting RRMS patients does not change significantly over 9 months and correlated well with EDSS scores. Our results indicate that balance control is a useful measure to assess recovery after a relapse, particularly in patients with unchanged EDSS scores. Based on our results, balance could be considered as additional measurement to assess recovery after a relapse, particularly in patients with unchanged EDSS.;"[Findling, Oliver; Rust, Heiko; Yaldizli, Ozgur; Allum, John H.

Currently, assessment of these patients is mainly subjective. New assessment options using wearables may provide complementary and more objective information. Methods: In this prospective cross-sectional feasibility study performed over a four-month period, all patients referred to a normal neurology ward of a university hospital and aged between 40 and 89 years were asked to participate. Gait and balance deficits were assessed with wearables at the ankles and the lower back. Frailty, sarcopenia, Parkinsonism, depression, quality of life, fall history, fear of falling, physical activity, and cognition were evaluated with questionnaires and surveys. Results: Eighty-two percent (n = 384) of all eligible patients participated. Of those, 39% (n = 151) had no gait and balance deficit, 21% (n = 79) had gait deficits, 11% (n = 44) had balance deficits and 29% (n = 110) had gait and balance deficits. Parkinson's disease, stroke, epilepsy, pain syndromes, and multiple sclerosis were the most common diseases. The assessment was well accepted. Conclusions: Our study suggests that the use of wearables for the assessment of gait and balance features in a clinical setting is feasible. Moreover, preliminary results confirm previous epidemiological data about gait and balance deficits among neurological inpatients. Evaluation of neurological inpatients with novel wearable technology opens new opportunities for the assessment of predictive, progression and treatment response markers.;"[Bernhard, Felix P.; Sartor, Jennifer; Bettecken, Kristina; Hobert, Markus A.; Arnold, Carina; Maetzler, Walter] Univ Tubingen, Dept Neurol & Neurodegenerat Dis, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Bernhard, Felix P.; Sartor, Jennifer; Bettecken, Kristina; Hobert, Markus A.; Arnold, Carina; Maetzler, Walter] Univ Tubingen, Hertie Inst Clin Brain Res, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Bernhard, Felix P.; Sartor, Jennifer; Bettecken, Kristina; Hobert, Markus A.; Arnold, Carina; Maetzler, Walter] German Ctr Neurodegenerat Dis, DZNE, Tubingen, Germany; [Hobert, Markus A.; Margraf, Nils G.; Schlenstedt, Christian; Hansen, Clint; Maetzler, Walter] Univ Hosp Schleswig Holstein, Dept Neurol, Campus Kiel,Arnold Heller Str 3,Haus 41, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Weber, Yvonne G.] Univ Tubingen, Dept Neurol & Epileptol, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Poli, Sven] Univ Hosp Tubingen, Dept Neurol & Stroke, Tubingen, Germany";Hansen, C (corresponding author), Univ Hosp Schleswig Holstein, Dept Neurol, Campus Kiel,Arnold Heller Str 3,Haus 41, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.;C.Hansen@neurologie.uni-kiel.de;"Hobert, Markus A./AAR-3234-2020; Schlenstedt, Christian/I-3443-2019; Maetzler, Walter/AAE-5831-2020; Hansen, Clint/J-4961-2019; Maetzler, Walter/A-6796-2011";"Schlenstedt, Christian/0000-0002-3838-6848; Maetzler, Walter/0000-0002-5945-4694; Hansen, Clint/0000-0003-4813-3868; Maetzler, Walter/0000-0002-5945-4694";Land Schleswig-Holstein within the funding programme Open Access Publikationsfonds;We acknowledge financial support by Land Schleswig-Holstein within the funding programme Open Access Publikationsfonds.;;51;17;18;2;23;BMC;LONDON;CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND;1471-2377;;;BMC NEUROL;BMC Neurol.;AUG 16;2018;18;;;;;;;;114;10.1186/s12883-018-1111-7;;;8;Clinical Neurology;Neurosciences & Neurology;GQ9XE;WOS:000442152700001;30115021;DOAJ Gold, Green Published;;;2021-03-18;

Methods/design: The proposed phase-HI trial will use a parallel group, RCT design that examines the effect of a 6-month behavioral intervention for increasing physical activity and secondarily improving mobility, cognition, symptoms, and quality of life (QOL) in persons with MS. The primary outcome is accelerometer-measured moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). The secondary outcomes include self-report measures of physical activity, walking impairment, cognition, fatigue, depression, anxiety, pain, sleep quality, and QOL. The tertiary outcomes are mediator variables based on SCT. Participants (N = 280) will be randomized into behavioral intervention (n = 140) or attention and social contact control (n = 140) conditions using computerized random numbers with concealed allocation. The conditions will be administered over 6-months by persons who are uninvolved in screening, recruitment, random assignment, and outcome assessment.

Supporting people with multiple sclerosis (MS) to achieve and maintain recommended levels of physical activity is important but challenging. Web-based interventions are increasingly being used to deliver targeted exercise programs and promote physical activity. Purpose. The purpose of this study was to systematically review current evidence regarding the effectiveness and user experience of web-based interventions in increasing physical activity in people with MS. Data Sources. MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, PEDro, PsychInfo, Web of Sciences, The Cochrane Library, and gray literature were searched from 1990 to September 2016. Study Selection. English language articles reporting the use of web-based interventions to increase physical activity in adults with MS were included. Eligible quantitative studies were of any design and reported a measure of physical activity. Qualitative studies exploring users' experiences in any context were included. Of the 881 articles identified, 9 met the inclusion criteria. Data Extraction. Two reviewers independently assessed methodological quality and extracted data using standardized critical appraisal and data extraction tools from the Joanna Briggs Institute Meta Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-MAStARI). Data Synthesis. Meta-analysis of self-reported physical activity questionnaire data from 4 studies demonstrated a standardized mean difference of 0.67 (95% CI = 0.43-0.92), indicating a positive effect in favor of the web-based interventions. Narrative review of accelerometry data from 3 studies indicated increases in objectively measured physical activity. No qualitative studies met the inclusion criteria. Limitations. In the 9 included articles, only 2 different interventions (used with people who were ambulant) were reported. Conclusions. Web-based interventions had a short-term positive effect on self-reported physical activity in people who had MS and were ambulant. Evidence is not currently available to support or refute their use in the long-term or with people who are not -ambulant.;"[Dennett, Rachel] Plymouth Univ, Sch Hlth Profess, Fac Hlth & Human Sci, Derriford Rd, Plymouth PL6 8BH, Devon, England; [Gunn, Hilary] Plymouth Univ, Sch Hlth Profess, Fac Hlth & Human Sci, Plymouth, Devon, England; [Freeman, Jennifer A.] Plymouth Univ, Sch Hlth Profess, Fac Hlth & Human Sci, Ctr Hlth & Social Care Innovat,Affiliated Ctr,Joa, Plymouth, Devon, England";Dennett, R (corresponding author), Plymouth Univ, Sch Hlth Profess, Fac Hlth & Human Sci, Derriford Rd, Plymouth PL6 8BH, Devon, England.;rachel.dennett@plymouth.ac.uk;;;;;;57;1;1;0;11;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA;0031-9023;1538-6724;;PHYS THER;Phys.

Objectives: To develop an accurate method for remote assessment of walking speed and to test how predictive the clinic T25FW is for real-life walking. Methods: An AX3-Axivity tri-axial accelerometer was positioned on 32 MS patients (Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS] 0-6) in the clinic, who subsequently wore it at home for up to 7 days. Gait speed was calculated from these data using both a model developed with healthy volunteers and individually personalized models generated from a machine learning algorithm. Results: The healthy volunteer model predicted gait speed poorly for more disabled people with MS. However, the accuracy of individually personalized models was high regardless of disability (R-value = 0.98, p-value = 1.85 x 10(-22)). With the latter, we confirmed that the clinic T25FW is strongly predictive of the maximum sustained gait speed in the home environment (R-value = 0.89, p-value = 4.34 x 10(-8)). Conclusion: Remote gait monitoring with individually personalized models is accurate for patients with MS.

Major improvements in acute care and diagnostics have created a tendency toward the chronification of formerly terminal conditions, requiring people with these conditions to learn how to self-manage. Mobile technologies hold promise as self-management tools due to their ubiquity and cost-effectiveness. The delivery of health-related services through mobile technologies (mobile health, mHealth) has grown exponentially in recent years. However, only a fraction of these solutions take into consideration the views of relevant stakeholders such as health care professionals or even patients. The use of behavioral change models (BCMs) has proven important in developing successful health solutions, yet engaging patients remains a challenge. There is a trend in mHealth solutions called gamification that attempts to use game elements to drive user behavior and increase engagement. As it stands, designers of mHealth solutions for behavioral change in chronic conditions have no clear way of deciding what factors are relevant to consider. Objective: The goal of this work is to discover factors for the design of mHealth solutions for chronic patients using negotiations between medical knowledge, BCMs, and gamification. Methods: This study uses an embedded case study research methodology consisting of 4 embedded units: 1) cross-sectional studies of mHealth applications; 2) statistical analysis of gamification presence; 3) focus groups and interviews to relevant stakeholders; and 4) research through design of an mHealth solution. The data obtained was thematically analyzed to create a conceptual model for the design of mHealth solutions. Results: The Model for Motivational Mobile-health Design (3MD) for chronic conditions guides the design of condition-oriented gamified behavioral change mHealth solutions. The main components are (1) condition specific, which describe factors that need to be adjusted and adapted for each particular chronic condition; (2) motivation related, which are factors that address how to influence behaviors in an engaging manner; and (3) technology based, which are factors that are directly connected to the technical capabilities of mobile technologies. The 3MD also provides a series of high-level illustrative design questions for designers to use and consider during the design process. Conclusions: This work addresses a recognized gap in research and practice, and proposes a unique model that could be of use in the generation of new solutions to help chronic patients.";"[Giunti, Guido] Salumedia Tecnol, Ave Republ Argentina 24, Seville 41011, Spain; [Giunti, Guido] Univ Oulu, Oulu, Finland";Giunti, G (corresponding author), Salumedia Tecnol, Ave Republ Argentina 24, Seville 41011, Spain.;drguidogiunti@gmail.com;Giunti, Guido/P-4460-2016;Giunti, Guido/0000-0003-0836-9825;Horizon 2020 Framework Programme of the European Commission [676201];The model presented here is part of the doctoral thesis dissertation of GG for the University of Oulu, Finland.

Ankle joint contractures in PWMS are common and often result in compensatory gait patterns to accommodate reduced ankle range of motion (ROM). Approach: Using advances in wearable technology, the aim of this study was to quantify head and pelvis movement patterns that occur in PwMS with disability and determine how these secondary gait compensations impact on gait stability. Twelve healthy participants and 12 PwMS participated in the study. Head and pelvis movements were measured using two tri-axial accelerometers. Measures of gait compensation, mobility, variability, asymmetry, stability and fatigue were assessed during a 6 min walking test. Main results: Compared to healthy controls, PwMS had greater vertical asymmetry in their head and pelvic movements (Cohen's d = 1.85 and 1.60). Lower harmonic ratios indicated that PwMS were more unstable than controls (Cohen's d = -1.61 to -3.06), even after adjusting for their slower walking speeds. In the PWMS, increased compensatory movements were correlated with reduced ankle active ROM (r = -0.71), higher disability (EDSS) scores (r = 0.58), unstable gait (r = -0.76), reduced mobility (r = -0.76) and increased variability (r = 0.83). Significance: Wearable device technology provides an efficient and reliable way to screen for excessive compensatory movements often present in PWMS and provides clinically important information that impacts on mobility, stride time variability and gait stability. This information may help clinicians identify PWMS at high risk of falling and develop better rehabilitation interventions that, in addition to improving mobility, may help target the underlying causes of unstable gait.;"[Psarakis, Michael; Greene, David A.; Cole, Michael H.; Phu Hoang] Australian Catholic Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Lord, Stephen R.; Phu Hoang; Brodie, Matthew] Univ New South Wales, Neurosci Res Australia, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Brodie, Matthew] UNSW, Grad Sch Biomed Engn, Sydney, NSW, Australia";Psarakis, M (corresponding author), Australian Catholic Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia.;michael.psarakis@acu.edu.au;"Brodie, Matthew A D/ABG-1640-2020; Cole, Michael H/O-6816-2018";"Brodie, Matthew A D/0000-0002-5711-3458; Cole, Michael/0000-0003-1817-7528";"NHMRCNational Health and Medical Research Council of Australia; MS Research Australia";This research was supported by NHMRC and MS Research Australia.;;38;12;12;1;10;IOP PUBLISHING LTD;BRISTOL;TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND;0967-3334;1361-6579;;PHYSIOL MEAS;Physiol.

Prolonged-release fampridine (PR-fam) improves walking speed, but it is unclear which walking measures are the most suitable for identifying treatment response. Our aim was to assess the effect of PR-fam and the outcome measures that best identify short- and long-term clinically meaningful response. Methods: We conducted a prospective study in 32 MS patients treated with PR-fam for a year. The assessments at 2 weeks, 3, 6 and 12 months included: timed 25-foot walk (T25FW), 6-minute walk test (6MWT), MS Walking Scale-12 (MSWS-12), a five-level version of the EuroQoL-5 dimensions, and accelerometry. PR-fam response was defined as an improvement in T25FW >= 20%. Results: Twenty-five (78%) patients were considered responders after 2 weeks of PR-fam and improved significantly in all measures. Responders to T25FW and MSWS-12 (n = 19) showed a significant improvement in HRQoL and accelerometer data compared with responders only to T25FW (n = 6). At 1 year, 15/20 (75%) patients remained responders, but only those with permanent response to T25FW and MSWS-12 (n = 8; 53%) showed a significant improvement in 6MWT and HRQoL.

Although currently available interventions have had limited success in relieving MS-related fatigue, clinically significant reductions in perceived fatigue severity have been reported in a multimodal intervention pilot study that included a Paleolithic diet in addition to stress reduction, exercise, and electrical muscle stimulation. An optimal dietary approach to reducing MS-related fatigue has not been identified. To establish the specific effects of diet on MS symptoms, this study focuses on diet only instead of the previously tested multimodal intervention by comparing the effectiveness of two dietary patterns for the treatment of MS-related fatigue. The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of a modified Paleolithic and low saturated fat diet on perceived fatigue (primary outcome), cognitive and motor symptoms, and quality of life in persons with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Methods/design: This 36-week randomized clinical trial consists of three 12-week periods during which assessments of perceived fatigue, quality of life, motor and cognitive function, physical activity and sleep, diet quality, and social support for eating will be collected. The three 12-week periods will consist of the following: 1. Observation: Participants continue eating their usual diet. 2. Intervention: Participants will be randomized to a modified Paleolithic or low saturated fat diet for the intervention period. Participants will receive support from a registered dietitian (RD) through in-person coaching, telephone calls, and emails. 3. Follow-up: Participants will continue the study diet for an additional 12 weeks with minimal RD support to assess the ability of the participants to sustain the study diet on their own. Discussion: Because fatigue is one of the most common and disabling symptoms of MS, effective management and reduction of MS-related fatigue has the potential to increase quality of life in this population. The results of this study will add to the evidence base for providing dietary recommendations to treat MS-related fatigue and other symptoms associated with this disease.;"[Wahls, Terry; Scott, Maria O.; Alshare, Zaidoon; Rubenstein, Linda; Darling, Warren; Carr, Lucas; Smith, Karen; Chenard, Catherine A.; Snetselaar, Linda] Univ Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [LaRocca, Nicholas] Natl Multiple Sclerosis Soc, New York, NY USA";Wahls, T (corresponding author), Univ Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.;terry-wahls@uiowa.edu;;Wahls, Terry/0000-0001-6059-7994;National Multiple Sclerosis SocietyNational Multiple Sclerosis Society;Funding for this trial was provided by the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.;;61;9;9;0;14;BIOMED CENTRAL LTD;LONDON;236 GRAYS INN RD, FLOOR 6, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND;1745-6215;;;TRIALS;Trials;JUN 4;2018;19;;;;;;;;309;10.1186/s13063-018-2680-x;;;16;Medicine, Research & Experimental;Research & Experimental Medicine;GI0XI;WOS:000434093300004;29866196;DOAJ Gold, Green Published;;;2021-03-18;

Methods: Cortical somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) were recorded in mice via wearable, flexible epidermal electrode arrays. We then utilized the sensors to explore the effects of transcranial focused ultrasound, which non-invasively induced neural perturbation. SSEPs recorded with flexible epidermal sensors were quantified and bench-marked against those recorded with invasive epidural electrodes. Results: We found that cortical SSEPs recorded by flexible epidermal sensors were stimulus frequency dependent. Immediately following controlled, focal ultrasound perturbation, the sensors detected significant SSEP modulation, which consisted of dynamic amplitude decreases and altered stimulus-frequency dependence. These modifications were also dependent on the ultrasound perturbation dosage. The effects were consistent with those recorded with invasive electrodes, albeit with roughly one order of magnitude lower signal-to-noise ratio. Conclusion: We found that flexible epidermal sensors reported multiple SSEP parameters that were sensitive to focused ultrasound. This work therefore 1) establishes that epidermal electrodes are appropriate for monitoring the integrity of major CNS functionalities through SSEP; and 2) lever-aged this technology to explore ultrasound-induced neuromodulation. The sensor technology is well suited for this application because the sensor electrical properties are uninfluenced by direct exposure to ultrasound irradiation.

In these clinical conditions the underlying neuroinflammatory processes are significantly heterogeneous. Nevertheless, a common link is the chronic activation of innate immune responses and imbalanced secretion of pro and anti-inflammatory mediators. In light of this, the discovery of robust biomarkers is crucial for screening, early diagnosis, and monitoring of neurological diseases. However, the difficulty to investigate biochemical processes directly in the central nervous system (CNS) is challenging. In recent years, biomarkers of CNS inflammatory responses have been identified in different body fluids, such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and tears. In addition, progress in micro and nanotechnology has enabled the development of biosensing platforms capable of detecting in real-time, multiple biomarkers in clinically relevant samples. Biosensing technologies are approaching maturity where they will become deployed in community settings, at which point screening programs and personalized medicine will become a reality. In this multidisciplinary review, our goal is to highlight both clinical and recent technological advances toward the development of multiplex -based solutions for effective neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disease diagnostics and monitoring.;"[Abreu, Catarina M.; Cruz, Andrea P.; Pinto, Ines Mendes] Int Iberian Nanotechnol Lab, Braga, Portugal; [Abreu, Catarina M.] Swansea Univ, Med Sch, Swansea, W Glam, Wales; [Soares-dos-Reis, Ricardo; Guimaraes, Joana; Sa, Maria Jose] Ctr Hosp Sao Joao, Neurol Dept, Porto, Portugal; [Soares-dos-Reis, Ricardo; Guimaraes, Joana] Univ Porto, Fac Med, Dept Clin Neurosci & Mental Hlth, Porto, Portugal; [Soares-dos-Reis, Ricardo] Univ Porto, Fac Med, Dept Biomed, Porto, Portugal; [Melo, Pedro N.] Univ Porto, Inst Ciencias Biomed Abel Salazar, Grad Programme Areas Basic & Appl Biol, Porto, Portugal; [Melo, Pedro N.; Relvas, Joao B.] Univ Porto, Inst Invest & Inovacao Saude, Porto, Portugal; [Guimaraes, Joana] Univ Porto, Ctr Drug Discovery & Innovat Med MedInUP, Porto, Portugal; [Sa, Maria Jose] Univ Fernando Pessoa, Energy Environm & Hlth Res Unit FP ENAS, Porto, Portugal; [Sa, Maria Jose] Univ Fernando Pessoa, Fac Hlth Sci, Porto, Portugal";"Cruz, AP; Pinto, IM (corresponding author), Int Iberian Nanotechnol Lab, Braga, Portugal.";"andrea.cruz@inl.int; ines.m.pinto@inl.int";"Melo, Pedro/AAY-4230-2020; Cruz, Andrea/K-4585-2013; Reis, Ricardo Soares dos/H-7863-2013; Sa, Maria Jose/AAD-4527-2021; Relvas, Joao/A-1142-2008";"Melo, Pedro/0000-0001-7887-6844; Cruz, Andrea/0000-0002-1662-3072; Reis, Ricardo Soares dos/0000-0001-6878-8568; Mendes Pinto, Ines/0000-0002-8009-7767; Relvas, Joao/0000-0001-7636-0924; Abreu, Catarina/0000-0001-9116-2395";"Marie Curie COFUND Programme NanoTRAINforGrowth from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration [600375]; Norte Portugal Regional Operational Programme (NORTE); European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)European Commission; Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia, PortugalPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [PD/BD/105751/2014]";IM and AC acknowledge the financial support from the Marie Curie COFUND Programme NanoTRAINforGrowth from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration under grant agreement no 600375.

Although the sensation of fatigue, tiredness, and energy level adversely affect physical activity (PA), the association between fatigability and objectively measured PA is unknown. Methods: Participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (n = 557, 50% women, aged 50-97 years) were instructed to wear an Actiheart accelerometer for 7 consecutive days in the free-living environment. Perceived fatigability was assessed using the Borg rating of perceived exertion (RPE) after 5 minutes of treadmill walking at 1.5 mph (0.67 m/s) and categorized as low (6-7 RPE), intermediate (8-9 RPE), and high (10(+) RPE) fatigability. Time-of-day PA differences between fatigability groups were assessed using mixed-effects modeling. Results: Total daily PA was 1.3% lower for every unit increment in perceived fatigability after adjusting for demographic, behavioral, and medical factors (p = .01). In time-of-day analyses, the high fatigability group was less active compared to the low fatigability group throughout the day (8: 00 am to 8: 00 pm) and the intermediate fatigability group in the morning (8: 00 am to 12: 00 pm). Patterns of PA within the high fatigability group differed from both the intermediate and low groups in the morning but mirrored the intermediate group in the afternoon and evening. Discussion: These results suggest that RPE is a bio-marker of fatigability associated with progressively lower PA with aging. Whether the effects of fatigability occurring at the end of the day reflect waning energy levels or a voluntary choice that could be modified remains to be evaluated.;"[Wanigatunga, Amal A.; Schrack, Jennifer A.] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Baltimore, MD USA; [Wanigatunga, Amal A.; Spira, Adam P.; Schrack, Jennifer A.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Ctr Aging & Hlth, Baltimore, MD USA; [Simonsick, Eleanor M.; Studenski, Stephanie; Ferrucci, Luigi] NIA, Intramural Res Program, Baltimore, MD 21224 USA; [Zipunnikov, Vadim] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Baltimore, MD USA; [Spira, Adam P.] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Mental Hlth, Baltimore, MD USA; [Spira, Adam P.] Johns Hopkins Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Baltimore, MD USA";Wanigatunga, AA (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Med Inst, Ctr Hlth & Aging, 2024 E Monument St, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.;awaniga1@jhu.edu;Simonsick, Eleanor/W-6864-2019;Wanigatunga, Amal/0000-0002-5763-5184;"Intramural Research Program of the National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA);  [R21AG053198];  [P30AG021334];  [T32AG000247];  [R01AG050507];  [RF1AG050745];  [U01AG052445];  [R01AG049872]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGINGUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA) [R01AG050507, R01AG050507, P30AG021334, P30AG021334, T32AG000247, P30AG021334, T32AG000247, T32AG000247, U01AG052445, P30AG021334, P30AG021334, P30AG021334, T32AG000247, P30AG021334, P30AG021334, P30AG021334, P30AG021334, P30AG021334, T32AG000247, T32AG000247, P30AG021334, T32AG000247, P30AG021334, P30AG021334, P30AG021334, P30AG021334, P30AG021334, P30AG021334, R21AG053198, P30AG021334, P30AG021334, T32AG000247, P30AG021334, ZIAAG000015, P30AG021334, U01AG052445, P30AG021334, ZIAAG000015, P30AG021334, P30AG021334, ZIAAG000015, U01AG052445, R01AG050507, T32AG000247, T32AG000247, P30AG021334, P30AG021334, ZIAAG000015, P30AG021334, P30AG021334, P30AG021334, P30AG021334, P30AG021334, P30AG021334, RF1AG050745, P30AG021334, ZIAAG000015, T32AG000247, P30AG021334, ZIAAG000015, T32AG000247, ZIAAG000015, T32AG000247, P30AG021334, P30AG021334, P30AG021334, U01AG052445, R01AG049872, P30AG021334, T32AG000247, P30AG021334, U01AG052445, T32AG000247, T32AG000247, T32AG000247, P30AG021334, P30AG021334, P30AG021334, U01AG052445, P30AG021334, P30AG021334, P30AG021334, P30AG021334, P30AG021334, R01AG050507, P30AG021334, P30AG021334, P30AG021334, R01AG050507, T32AG000247, U01AG052445, P30AG021334, P30AG021334, P30AG021334, T32AG000247, P30AG021334, R01AG049872, P30AG021334, P30AG021334, P30AG021334, P30AG021334, P30AG021334, P30AG021334, T32AG000247, ZIAAG000015, P30AG021334, P30AG021334, P30AG021334, P30AG021334, P30AG021334, T32AG000247, R21AG053198, P30AG021334, R01AG050507, P30AG021334, U01AG052445, P30AG021334, R01AG049872, P30AG021334, ZIAAG000015, P30AG021334, P30AG021334, P30AG021334, P30AG021334, P30AG021334, P30AG021334, P30AG021334, P30AG021334, T32AG000247, ZIAAG000015, P30AG021334, T32AG000247, R01AG049872, P30AG021334, P30AG021334, ZIAAG000015, P30AG021334, P30AG021334, T32AG000247, P30AG021334, R01AG049872, P30AG021334, T32AG000247, T32AG000247, P30AG021334, P30AG021334, T32AG000247, P30AG021334, P30AG021334, P30AG021334, P30AG021334, T32AG000247, P30AG021334] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER";This research was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health.

In current fatigue management interventions, personalized, real-time follow-up is often lacking. The objective of the study is to assess the feasibility of the MS TeleCoach, a novel intervention offering telemonitoring of fatigue and telecoaching of physical activity and energy management in persons with MS (pwMS) over a 12-week period. The goal of the MS TeleCoach, conceived as a combination of monitoring, self-management and motivational messages, is to enhance levels of physical activity thereby improving fatigue in pwMS in an accessible and interactive way, reinforcing self-management of patients. Methods: We conducted a prospective, open-label feasibility study of the MS TeleCoach in pwMS with Expanded Disability Status Scale <= 4 and moderate to severe fatigue as measured by the Fatigue Scale for Motor and Cognitive Functions (FSMC). Following a 2-week run-in period to assess the baseline activity level per patient, the target number of activity counts was gradually increased over the 12-week period through telecoaching. The primary efficacy outcome was change in FSMC total score from baseline to study end. A subset of patients was asked to fill in D-QUEST 2.0, a usability questionnaire, to evaluate the satisfaction with the MS TeleCoach device and the experienced service. Results: Seventy-five patients were recruited from 16 centres in Belgium, of which 57 patients (76%) completed the study. FSMC total score (p = 0.009) and motor and cognitive subscores (p = 0.007 and p = 0.02 respectively) decreased from baseline to week 12, indicating an improvement in fatigue. One third of participants with severe fatigue changed to a lower FSMC category for both FSMC total score and subscores. The post-study evaluation of patient satisfaction showed that the intervention was well accepted and that patients were very satisfied with the quality of the professional services. Conclusion: Using MS TeleCoach as a self-management tool in pwMS suffering from mild disability and moderate to severe fatigue appeared to be feasible, both technically and from a content perspective. Its use was associated with improved fatigue levels in the participants who completed the study. The MS Telecoach seems to meet the need for a low-cost, accessible and interactive self-management tool in MS.;"[D'hooghe, Marie; Nagels, Guy] Natl MS Ctr, Neurol, Vanheylenstr 16, Melsbroek, Belgium; [D'hooghe, Marie; Nagels, Guy] Vrije Univ Brussel, Ctr Neurosci, Laarbeeklaan 103, B-1090 Brussels, Belgium; [Van Gassen, Geert] Teva Pharma Belgium NV, Med Dept, Laarstr 16, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium; [Kos, Daphne] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Rehabil Sci, Tervuursevest 101,Postbox 1501 Gebouw De Nayer, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium; [Bouquiaux, Olivier] Ctr Neurol & Readaptat Fonct, Neurol, Champ Alouettes 30, B-4557 Fraiture, Belgium; [Cambron, Melissa] Univ Ziekenhuis Brussel, Neurol, Laarbeeklaan 103, B-1090 Brussels, Belgium; [Decoo, Danny] AZ Alma, Neurol, Ringlaan 15, B-9900 Eeklo, Belgium; [Lysandropoulos, Andreas] Erasme Univ Hosp, Neurol, Route Lennik 808, B-1070 Brussels, Belgium; [Van Wijmeersch, Bart] Hasselt Univ, Boemerangstr 2, B-3900 Overpelt, Belgium; [Van Wijmeersch, Bart] Translat Univ Limburg, Sch Life Sci, Biomed Res Inst, Boemerangstr 2, B-3900 Overpelt, Belgium; [Van Wijmeersch, Bart] Translat Univ Limburg, Rehabil & MS Ctr, Boemerangstr 2, B-3900 Overpelt, Belgium; [Willekens, Barbara] Univ Ziekenhuis Antwerpen, Neurol, Wilrijkstr 10, B-2650 Edegem, Belgium; [Penner, Iris-Katharina] Heinrich Heine Univ, Neurol, Med Fac, Merowingerpl 1, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany; [Penner, Iris-Katharina] Heinrich Heine Univ, COGITO Ctr Neurocognit & Neuropsychol, Merowingerpl 1, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany; [Kos, Daphne] AP Univ Coll Antwerp, Occupat Therapy, Campus Spoor Noord,Noorderplaats 2, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium";"D'hooghe, M (corresponding author), Natl MS Ctr, Neurol, Vanheylenstr 16, Melsbroek, Belgium.; D'hooghe, M (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Brussel, Ctr Neurosci, Laarbeeklaan 103, B-1090 Brussels, Belgium.; Van Gassen, G (corresponding author), Teva Pharma Belgium NV, Med Dept, Laarstr 16, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium.";"marie.dhooghe@mscenter.be; geert.vangassen@tevabelgium.be; daphne.kos@kuleuven.be; bouquiauxoli@me.com; melissa.cambron@gmail.com; dannydecoo@me.com; andreas.lys@hotmail.com; bart.vanwijmeersch@uhasselt.be; Barbara.Willekens@uza.be; ik.penner@cogito-center.com; guy.nagels@mscenter.be";"Willekens, Barbara/AAE-9296-2020; Kos, Daphne/G-4376-2011";"Kos, Daphne/0000-0003-3566-2269; D'hooghe, Marie/0000-0002-0917-4176; Nagels, Guy/0000-0002-2597-0383; Willekens, Barbara/0000-0002-5212-8837; Penner, Iris-Katharina/0000-0002-6746-1034";Teva Pharma Belgium [TV44400-CNS-40005];This study (TV44400-CNS-40005) is a Company Sponsored Study of Teva Pharma Belgium;;25;13;13;0;7;ELSEVIER SCI LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND;2211-0348;2211-0356;;MULT SCLER RELAT DIS;Mult.

To this purpose, algorithms to detect and characterise gait from wearable inertial sensors data were also validated. Methods Fourteen patients with MS were divided into two groups according to their disability level (EDSS 6.5-6.0 and EDSS 5.5-5.0, respectively). They performed both intermittent and continuous walking bouts (WBs) in a gait laboratory wearing waist and shank mounted inertial sensors. An algorithm (W-CWT) to estimate gait events and temporal parameters (mean and variability values) using data recorded from the waist mounted sensor (Dynaport, Mc Roberts) was tested against a reference algorithm (S-REF) based on the shank-worn sensors (OPAL, APDM). Subsequently, the accuracy of another algorithm (W-PAM) to detect and classify WBs was also tested. The validated algorithms were then used to quantify gait characteristics during short (sWB, 5-50 steps), intermediate (iWB, 51-100 steps) and long (lWB, >100 steps) daily living WBs and laboratory walking. Group means were compared using a two-way ANOVA. Results W-CWT compared to S-REF showed good gait event accuracy (0.05-0.10 s absolute error) and was not influenced by disability level. It slightly overestimated stride time in intermittent walking (0.012 s) and overestimated highly variability of temporal parameters in both intermittent (17.5%-58.2%) and continuous walking (11.2%-76.7%). The accuracy of W-PAM was speed-dependent and decreased with increasing disability. The ANOVA analysis showed that patients walked at a slower pace in daily living than in the laboratory. In daily living gait, all mean temporal parameters decreased as the WB duration increased. In the sWB, the patients with a lower disability score showed, on average, lower values of the temporal parameters. Variability decreased as the WB duration increased. Conclusions This study validated a method to quantify walking in real life in people with MS and showed how gait characteristics estimated from short walking bouts during daily living may be the most informative to quantify level of disability and effects of interventions in patients moderately affected by MS. The study provides a robust approach for the quantification of recognised clinically relevant outcomes and an innovative perspective in the study of real life walking.;"[Storm, Fabio A.; Mazza, Claudia] Univ Sheffield, Dept Mech Engn, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Storm, Fabio A.; Nair, K.

However, for most people around the world, current neurological care is poor. In low-income countries, most individuals lack access to proper neurological care, and in high-income countries, distance and disability limit access. With the global proliferation of smartphones, teleneurology - the use of technology to provide neurological care and education remotely - has the potential to improve and increase access to care for billions of people. Telestroke has already fulfilled this promise, but teleneurology applications for chronic conditions are still in their infancy. Similarly, few studies have explored the capabilities of mobile technologies such as smartphones and wearable sensors, which can guide care by providing objective, frequent, real-world assessments of patients. In low-income settings, teleneurology can increase the capacity of local care systems through professional development, diagnostic support and consultative services. In high-income settings, teleneurology is likely to promote the expansion and migration of neurological care away from institutions, incorporate systems of asynchronous communication (such as e-mail), integrate clinicians with diverse skill sets and reach new populations. Inertia, outdated policies and social barriers - especially the digital divide - will slow this progress at considerable cost. However, a future increasingly will be possible in which neurological care can be accessed by anyone, anywhere. Here, we examine the emerging evidence regarding the benefits of teleneurology for chronic conditions, its role and risks in low-income countries and the promise of mobile technologies to measure disease status and deliver care. We conclude by discussing the future trends, barriers and timing for the adoption of teleneurology.;"[Dorsey, E.

Forty older adults with MS (median age = 60 years) who had a median Expanded Disability Status Scale score of 4.5 wore an accelerometer for a 7-day period and completed the Short Physical Performance Battery (SBBP), 6-minute walk (6MW), and timed 25-foot walk (T25FW).

The purpose of this study was to evaluate segmental control during quiet standing in PwMS and controls to understand whether MS alters use of the ankle and hip strategies to manage postural sway. Coherence of acceleration between the trunk and legs was evaluated with accelerometers placed on the sacrum and lower leg. Thirty-six PwMS and 20 healthy control subjects performed quiet standing with eyes open and closed while center of pressure (CoP) and acceleration of postural sway was measured. Acceleration frequencies were divided into lower frequencies (<= 1.0 Hz) and higher frequencies (> 1.0 Hz) to categorize sway characteristics. With eyes open, coherence was significantly lower in PwMS compared to controls at lower frequencies only. With eyes closed, coherence was significantly lower in PwMS compared to controls, who use an ankle strategy at lower frequencies only, at both lower and higher frequencies. Both groups showed decreased coherence with increasing frequency when eyes were open and closed. Coherence was significantly correlated with CoP sway area in PwMS during the eyes closed condition only. The reduced coherence in PwMS during both lower and higher frequency sway indicates PwMS utilize a mixed ankle-hip sway strategy regardless of sway frequency. This is in contrast to sway in healthy subjects which utilizes an ankle strategy at lower frequencies and a mixed strategy at higher frequencies. Lack of adaptability in segmental control strategy likely contributes to abnormal postural control, as reflected by CoP sway patterns, in PwMS.;"[Huisinga, Jessie] Univ Kansas, Landon Ctr Aging, Med Ctr, 3901 Rainbow Blvd,Mail Stop 1005, Kansas City, KS 66160 USA; [Mancini, Martina; Veys, Chris; Spain, Rebecca; Horak, Fay] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Neurol, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Pk Rd,L226, Portland, OR 97239 USA; [Spain, Rebecca; Horak, Fay] VA Portland VA Hlth Care Syst, Neurol Dept, PNEUR, 3710 SW US Vet Hosp Rd, Portland, OR 97239 USA";Huisinga, J (corresponding author), Univ Kansas, Landon Ctr Aging, Med Ctr, 3901 Rainbow Blvd,Mail Stop 1005, Kansas City, KS 66160 USA.;jhuisinga@kumc.edu;;Huisinga, Jessie/0000-0002-4249-1421;"National Multiple Sclerosis SocietyNational Multiple Sclerosis Society [RG4914A1/2, MB 0011]; United States Department of Veteran's AffairsUS Department of Veterans Affairs [E1075-R]; National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01 AG00645729]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGINGUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA) [R01AG006457, R01AG006457, R01AG006457, R01AG006457, R01AG006457, R01AG006457, R01AG006457, R01AG006457, R01AG006457, R01AG006457, R01AG006457, R01AG006457, R01AG006457, R01AG006457, R01AG006457, R01AG006457, R01AG006457, R01AG006457, R01AG006457, R01AG006457, R01AG006457, R01AG006457, R01AG006457, R01AG006457, R01AG006457, R01AG006457] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; Veterans AffairsUS Department of Veterans Affairs [I01RX001075, I01RX001075] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER";"We would like to acknowledge the assistance of Rebecca St. George for her help with data collection.

Fatigue is one of most common symptoms that persons with MS experience, having significant impact on their quality of life and limiting their activity levels. Self-management strategies are used to support them in the care of their health. Mobile health (mHealth) solutions are a way to offer persons with chronic conditions tools to successfully manage their symptoms and problems. Gamification is a current trend among mHealth apps used to create engaging user experiences and is suggested to be effective for behavioral change. To be effective, mHealth solutions need to be designed to specifically meet the intended audience needs. User-centered design (UCD) is a design philosophy that proposes placing end users' needs and characteristics in the center of design and development, involving users early in the different phases of the software life cycle. There is a current gap in mHealth apps for persons with MS, which presents an interesting area to explore. Objective: The purpose of this study was to describe the design and evaluation process of a gamified mHealth solution for behavioral change in persons with MS using UCD. Methods: Building on previous work of our team where we identified needs, barriers, and facilitators for mHealth apps for persons with MS, we followed UCD to design and evaluate a mobile app prototype aimed to help persons with MS self-manage their fatigue. Design decisions were evidence-driven and guided by behavioral change models (BCM). Usability was assessed through inspection methods using Nielsen's heuristic evaluation. Results: The mHealth solution More Stamina was designed. It is a task organization tool designed to help persons with MS manage their energy to minimize the impact of fatigue in their day-to-day life. The tool acts as a to-do list where users can input tasks in a simple manner and assign Stamina Credits, a representation of perceived effort, to the task to help energy management and energy profiling. The app also features personalization and positive feedback. The design process gave way to relevant lessons to the design of a gamified behavioral change mHealth app such as the importance of metaphors in concept design, negotiate requirements with the BCM constructs, and tailoring of gamified experiences among others. Several usability problems were discovered during heuristic evaluation and guided the iterative design of our solution. Conclusions: In this paper, we designed an app targeted for helping persons with MS in their fatigue management needs. We illustrate how UCD can help in designing mHealth apps and the benefits and challenges that designers might face when using this approach. This paper provides insight into the design process of gamified behavioral change mHealth apps and the negotiation process implied in it.;"[Giunti, Guido] Salumedia Tecnol, Avda Republ Argentina 24, Seville 41011, Spain; [Giunti, Guido; Mylonopoulou, Vasiliki] Univ Oulu, Oulu, Finland; [Rivera Romero, Octavio] Univ Seville, Seville, Spain";Giunti, G (corresponding author), Salumedia Tecnol, Avda Republ Argentina 24, Seville 41011, Spain.;drguidogiunti@gmail.com;"Rivera, Octavio/I-5281-2017; Giunti, Guido/P-4460-2016";"Rivera Romero, Octavio/0000-0001-7212-9805; Mylonopoulou, Vasiliki/0000-0002-2493-5543; Giunti, Guido/0000-0003-0836-9825";Horizon 2020 Framework Programme of the European Commission [676201];Guido Giunti MD and Vasiliki Mylonopoulou gratefully acknowledge the grant number 676201 for the Connected Health Early-stage researcher Support System (CHESS ITN) from the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme of the European Commission.;;87;13;13;0;26;JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC;TORONTO;59 WINNERS CIRCLE, TORONTO, ON M4L 3Y7, CANADA;2291-5222;;;JMIR MHEALTH UHEALTH;JMIR mHealth uHealth;MAR;2018;6;3;;;;;;;e51;10.2196/mhealth.9437;;;17;"Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics";"Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics";FY0JP;WOS:000426497400002;29500159;DOAJ Gold, Green Published, Green Accepted;;;2021-03-18;

Biomechanical assessments using advanced gait and balance analysis technologies can identify these subtle changes and could be used to predict mobility loss early in the disease. This update critically evaluates advanced gait and balance analysis technologies and their applicability to identifying early lower limb dysfunction in people with MS. Non-wearable (motion capture systems, force platforms, and sensor-embedded walkways) and wearable (pressure and inertial sensors) biomechanical analysis systems have been developed to provide quantitative gait and balance assessments. Non-wearable systems are highly accurate, reliable and provide detailed outcomes, but require cumbersome and expensive equipment. Wearable systems provide less detail but can be used in community settings and can provide real-time feedback to patients and clinicians. Biomechanical analysis using advanced gait and balance analysis technologies can identify changes in gait and balance in early MS and consequently have the potential to significantly improve monitoring of mobility changes in MS.;"[Shanahan, Camille J.; Boonstra, Frederique M.

Evidence suggests that physical activity (PA) helps people with MS reduce fatigue and improve quality of life. The use of mobile technologies for health has grown in recent years with little involvement from relevant stakeholders. User-centered design (UCD) is a design philosophy with the goal of creating solutions specific to the needs and tasks of the intended users. UCD involves stakeholders early and often in the design process. In a preliminary study, we assessed the landscape of commercially available MS mobile health (mHealth) apps; to our knowledge, no study has explored what persons with MS and their formal care providers think of mHealth solutions for PA. Objective: The aim of this study was to (1) explore MS-specific needs for MS mHealth solutions for PA, (2) detect perceived obstacles and facilitators for mHealth solutions from persons with MS and health care professionals, and (3) understand the motivational aspects behind adoption of mHealth solutions for MS. Methods: A mixed-methods design study was conducted in Kliniken Valens, Switzerland, a clinic specializing in neurological rehabilitation. We explored persons with MS and health care professionals who work with them separately. The study had a qualitative part comprising focus groups and interviews, and a quantitative part with standardized tools such as satisfaction with life scale and electronic health (eHealth) literacy. Results: A total of 12 persons with relapsing-remitting MS and 12 health care professionals from different backgrounds participated in the study. Participants were well-educated with an even distribution between genders. Themes identified during analysis were MS-related barriers and facilitators, mHealth design considerations, and general motivational aspects. The insights generated were used to create MS personas for design purposes. Desired mHealth features were as follows: (1) activity tracking, (2) incentives for completing tasks and objectives, (3) customizable goal setting, (4) optional sociability, and (5) game-like attitude among others. Potential barriers to mHealth apps adoption were as follows: (1) rough on-boarding experiences, (2) lack of clear use benefits, and (3) disruption of the health care provider-patient relationship. Potential facilitators were identified: (1) endorsements from experts, (2) playfulness, and (3) tailored to specific persons with MS needs. A total of 4 MS personas were developed to provide designers and computer scientists means to help in the creation of future mHealth solutions for MS. Conclusions: mHealth solutions for increasing PA in persons with MS hold promise. Allowing for realistic goal setting and positive feedback, while minimizing usability burdens, seems to be critical for the adoption of such apps. Fatigue management is especially important in this population; more attention should be brought to this area.";"[Giunti, Guido] Salumedia Tecnol, Avda Republ Argentina 24, Seville 41011, Spain; [Giunti, Guido] Univ Oulu, Oulu, Finland; [Kool, Jan] Klin Valens, Valens, Switzerland; [Rivera Romero, Octavio; Dorronzoro Zubiete, Enrique] Univ Seville, Seville, Spain";Giunti, G (corresponding author), Salumedia Tecnol, Avda Republ Argentina 24, Seville 41011, Spain.;drguidogiunti@gmail.com;"Kool, J/AAM-9721-2020; Rivera, Octavio/I-5281-2017; Giunti, Guido/P-4460-2016";"Giunti, Guido/0000-0003-0836-9825; Rivera Romero, Octavio/0000-0001-7212-9805; Kool, Jan/0000-0002-7074-8589";European CommissionEuropean CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [676201];"GG gratefully acknowledges the grant number 676201 for the Connected Health Early Stage Researcher Support System (CHESS ITN) from the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme of the European Commission.

The HCS yields categories of insufficiently active (less substantial or low benefits), moderately active (some benefits), and active (substantial benefits). The present study examined the validity of the GLTEQ HCS and its categories as reflecting levels of MVPA in multiple sclerosis (MS). Method: The sample included 684 persons with MS. Participants wore an accelerometer on an elastic belt around the waist above the nondominant hip during the waking hours of the day over a 7-day period and completed the GLTEQ. Results: The data analyses supported a large correlation between the GLTEQ HCS and accelerometer-measured MVPA, r = .46, p < .0001, but small correlations with accelerometer-measured light physical activity (LPA), r = .16, p < .001 and sedentary time, r = -.13, p = .001. There further was a large difference in accelerometer-measured MVPA between categories of physical activity levels (i.e., insufficiently active vs. active) based on the GLTEQ HCS (d = 0.89), but small differences in LPA (d = 0.39) and sedentary time (d = -0.31). Those results were unchanged in additional data analyses accounting for LPA and sedentary behavior. Conclusions: The GLTEQ HCS and categories primarily reflect MVPA rather than LPA and sedentary behavior in persons with MS.;"[Motl, Robert W.; Sandroff, Brian M.] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Phys Therapy, Sch Hlth Profess, 1716 9th Ave South, Birmingham, AL 35233 USA; [Bollaert, Rachel E.] Univ Illinois, Dept Kinesiol & Community Hlth, Champaign, IL USA";Motl, RW (corresponding author), Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Phys Therapy, Sch Hlth Profess, 1716 9th Ave South, Birmingham, AL 35233 USA.;robmotl@uab.edu;;Sandroff, Brian/0000-0002-2013-7632;;;;24;19;19;1;2;EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC;WASHINGTON;750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA;0090-5550;1939-1544;;REHABIL PSYCHOL;Rehabil.

Methods: A total of eight functional tests were conducted and physical activity was objectively measured (Actigraph GT3X accelerometer) for one week in 34 people with multiple sclerosis. A corrected Akaike Information Criterion analysis was performed to identify the strongest correlates with moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, total activity and sedentary time. Results: The multiple regression analysis converged on a model for moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (R-2 = 0.31, F = 6.97, p= 0.003) that included total strength of the less-affected leg (partial r = 0.46, p= 0.007) and average peg test performance (partial r= -030, p= 0.087). The model for total activity (R-2 =0.40, F=10.51, p < 0.001) included five times sit-to-stand performance (partial r= -0.44, p = 0.010) and total strength of the less-affected leg (partial r=0.31, p = 0.077). The model for sedentary time (R-2=0.22, F= 9.23, p= 0.005) only included total strength of the more affected leg (r= -0.47,p= 0.005). Conclusion: These results suggest that leg strength, manual dexterity and the ability to perform functional tasks may be important correlates with physical activity levels in people with multiple sclerosis. The findings of this pilot study can inform future investigations aiming to increase physical activity levels or develop improved rehabilitation protocols for people with multiple sclerosis.;"[Ketelhut, Nathaniel B.; Kindred, John H.; Pimentel, Richard E.; Tracy, Brian L.; Reiser, Raoul F.; Rudroff, Thorsten] Colorado State Univ, Dept Hlth & Exercise Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Hess, Ann M.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Stat, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA";Rudroff, T (corresponding author), 201 D Moby B Complex, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.;Thorsten.Rudroff@colostate.edu;;;;;;53;7;8;1;6;TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0963-8288;1464-5165;;DISABIL REHABIL;Disabil.

In particular, texting has been shown to significantly alter gait patterns. However, no specific investigations have been performed on people with Multiple Sclerosis (pwMS), who are already characterized by gait dysfunctions caused by the disease. Objective: To assess the existence of possible alterations in spatio-temporal parameters of gait in pwMS when simultaneously texting on a smartphone and walking. Methods: Fifty-four pwMS (mean age 40.5 +/- 10.5) and 40 age-matched unaffected individuals were tested in two conditions: walking, and walking while texting on a smartphone. Spatio-temporal parameters of gait were assessed using a wearable accelerometer located on the lower back. Results: Texting induces reduction of gait speed, stride length and cadence in both groups, but such changes were smaller in magnitude in pwMS. An increase of stance and double support and reduction of swing phase were observed in pwMS only. Conclusions: Texting alters gait patterns of pwMS differently from unaffected individuals, probably due to a different prioritization of the task, which appears to take into account the motor and sensory impairments associated with the disease by favoring the motor task.;"[Pau, Massimiliano; Corona, Federica; Pilloni, Giuseppina; Porta, Micaela] Univ Cagliari, Dept Mech Chem & Mat Engn, Piazza Armi, I-09123 Cagliari, Italy; [Porta, Micaela; Coghe, Giancarlo; Cocco, Eleonora] Univ Cagliari, Dept Med Sci & Publ Hlth, Multiple Sclerosis Ctr, Cagliari, Italy";Pau, M (corresponding author), Univ Cagliari, Dept Mech Chem & Mat Engn, Piazza Armi, I-09123 Cagliari, Italy.;massimiliano.pau@dimcm.unica.it;"Pau, Massimiliano/P-7878-2014; Cocco, Eleonora/G-5064-2012";"Pau, Massimiliano/0000-0001-9835-3629; Cocco, Eleonora/0000-0002-3878-8820";Fondazione SardegnaFondazione Banco di Sardegna [FBS 2012.0794, FBS 2014.1175, FBS 2015.1358];This study was partly supported by Fondazione Sardegna (grants FBS 2012.0794, FBS 2014.1175 and FBS 2015.1358).;;31;7;7;0;0;ELSEVIER SCI LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND;2211-0348;2211-0356;;MULT SCLER RELAT DIS;Mult.

Therefore, RORt has attracted much attention as a target receptor for the treatment of inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel diseases, and psoriasis. This study aims to characterize TAK-828F, a potent and selective RORt inverse agonist. Methods: The biochemical properties of TAK-828F were evaluated using Time-Resolved Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (TR-FRET) binding assay, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor assay, cofactor recruitment assay, reporter assay, and IL-17 expression assay. Results: TR-FRET binding assay and SPR biosensor assay revealed rapid, reversible, and high affinity binding of TAK-828F to RORt. The cofactor recruitment assay showed that TAK-828F inhibited the recruitment of steroid receptor coactivator-1 to RORt. Furthermore, TAK-828F inhibited the transcriptional activity of human and mouse RORt with selectivity against human ROR and ROR. TAK-828F also suppressed IL-17 production in Jurkat cells, overexpressing human RORt. Conclusion: These favorable properties will be of advantage in the evaluation of TAK-828F in clinical studies for inflammatory diseases. Furthermore, these findings demonstrate that TAK-828F could serve as a pharmacological tool for further studies of RORt and inflammatory diseases.;"[Nakagawa, Hideyuki; Koyama, Ryoukichi; Kamada, Yusuke; Nakayama, Masaharu] Takeda Pharmaceut Co Ltd, Pharmaceut Res Div, Biomol Res Labs, Fujisawa, Kanagawa, Japan; [Ochida, Atsuko; Kono, Mitsunori; Shirai, Junya; Yamamoto, Satoshi] Takeda Pharmaceut Co Ltd, Pharmaceut Res Div, Immunol Unit, Fujisawa, Kanagawa, Japan; [Ambrus-Aikelin, Geza; Sang, Bi-Ching] Takeda Pharmaceut Co Ltd, Pharmaceut Res Div, Takeda California, Fujisawa, Kanagawa, Japan";Nakagawa, H (corresponding author), Takeda Pharmaceut Co Ltd, Biomol Res Labs, Chuo Ku, 1-1,Nihonbashi Honcho 2 Chome, Tokyo 1038668, Japan.;hideyuki.nakagawa@takeda.com;;;;;;33;4;4;0;0;KARGER;BASEL;ALLSCHWILERSTRASSE 10, CH-4009 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;0031-7012;1423-0313;;PHARMACOLOGY;Pharmacology;;2018;102;5-6;;;;;244;252;;10.1159/000492226;;;9;Pharmacology & Pharmacy;Pharmacology & Pharmacy;HB5AK;WOS:000451068900002;30134246;;;;2021-03-18;

However, the effects of different types of postures and different underfoot surfaces on PB have not adequately been addressed. Purpose: The main aim of this study was to investigate the effect of different conditions of footwear, surfaces, and standing positions on static and dynamic PB ability of young ballet dancers. Methods: A total of 36 male and female young professional ballet dancers (aged 14-19 years) completed static and dynamic balance testing, measured by head and lumbar accelerometers, while standing on one leg in the turnout position, under six different conditions: (1) relaxed posture; (2) ballet posture; (3) barefoot; (4) ballet shoes with textured insoles; (5) barefoot on a textured mat; and (6) barefoot on a spiky mat. Results: A condition effect was found for static and dynamic PB. Static PB was reduced when dancers stood in the ballet posture compared with standing in the relaxed posture and when standing on a textured mat and on a spiky mat (p < .05), and static PB in the relaxed posture was significantly better than PB in all the other five conditions tested. Dynamic PB was significantly better while standing in ballet shoes with textured insoles and when standing on a spiky mat compared with all other conditions (p < .05). Conclusions: The practical implications derived from this study are that both male and female dancers should try to be relaxed in their postural muscles when practicing a ballet aligned position, including dance practice on different types of floors and on different types of textured/ spiky materials may result in skill transfer to practice on normal floor surfaces, and both static and dynamic PB exercises should be assessed and generalized into practical dance routines.";"[Steinberg, Nili; Waddington, Gordon; Adams, Roger; Karin, Janet] Univ Canberra, Res Inst Sport & Exercise, Fac Hlth, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Steinberg, Nili] Wingate Coll, Phys Educ & Sport Sci, Wingate Inst, Netanya, Israel; [Karin, Janet] Australian Ballet Sch, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Tirosh, Oren] Swinburne Univ Technol, Sch Med & Hlth Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia";Steinberg, N (corresponding author), Univ Canberra, Res Inst Sport & Exercise, Fac Hlth, Canberra, ACT, Australia.;knopp@wincol.ac.il;Tirosh, Oren/N-6341-2019;Waddington, Gordon/0000-0002-4306-9193;;;;73;4;4;3;13;HUMAN KINETICS PUBL INC;CHAMPAIGN;1607 N MARKET ST, PO BOX 5076, CHAMPAIGN, IL 61820-2200 USA;1087-1640;1543-2696;;MOTOR CONTROL;Motor Control;JAN;2018;22;1;;;;;45;66;;10.1123/mc.2016-0076;;;22;"Neurosciences; Sport Sciences";"Neurosciences & Neurology; Sport Sciences";GB9FY;WOS:000429380700004;28338396;;;;2021-03-18;

Methods: A systematic search strategy on eight databases (2000-2016) using keywords associated with MS and PA. Results: This review includes 32 papers. Uni-axial accelerometers were the most popular objective PA tool in this review (68%). Pedometers (14%) and multi-sensor systems (3%) were the second and third most common. PA outputs included activity counts per day, steps per day, energy expenditure per day, minutes of moderate-vigorous PA (MVPA), minutes of light PA and daily dynamic activity. Both activity counts per day (n = 21 studies), and steps per day (n = 11 studies) were most commonly used representing 78%. Conclusion: Uni-axial accelerometers and pedometers are the most popular PA measurement tools used in MS literature. However, developments in the field mean that most new sensors are tri-axial, and multi-sensor systems are also available. Researchers should use devices with published validation information, and should utilize the detail on activity patterns available from accelerometer measurement instead of expressing a single unit such as activity counts or step counts per day.

IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION The review reports that accelerometers were the research tool most frequently reported in the literature, though there were differences in device type and in how activity data was extracted from the stored information.

The benefits of technology in healthcare have been demonstrated in many health conditions. This study aims to seek the views of People with multiple sclerosis (MS) of the feasibility and perceived acceptability of smartphone use for healthcare purposes. Methods: Using SurveyMonkey, respondents answered 21 items about their smartphone use and acceptance of smartphones in healthcare. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize data from closed questions. Content analysis was used for open questions. Results: Most of the self-selected 197 respondents were female (138/197;70.1%), aged 42.78 +/- 10.29 years, had relapsing-remitting MS (143/187;76.5%), and mobilized without an aid (154/197;78.17%). Most respondents reported having smartphone access (174/191;91.1%) and owning smartphones (167/192;86.97%). Perceived benefits of smartphones included improved healthcare access (119/190;62.63%) and greater independence (124/190;65.26%). The top three concerns included reduced contact with Healthcare Professionals (66/186;35.48%), data security (60/186;32.26%) and visual impairment (47/184;25.54%). Conclusion: These findings suggest that smartphone use is extensive, frequent, and acceptable for healthcare purposes in this self-selected sample. People with MS should be consulted during the design of smartphone-based interventions, as specific concerns were raised. Future studies should explore how this technology may be best used and implemented in practice.";"[Griffin, Nicola] Kings Coll Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, Dept Physiotherapy, Denmark Hill, London SE5 9RS, England; [Kehoe, Maria] Dept Hlth Serv Execut Community Physiotherapy, Naas, Kildare, Ireland";Griffin, N (corresponding author), Kings Coll Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, Dept Physiotherapy, Denmark Hill, London SE5 9RS, England.;nicolagriffin1@nhs.net;;;Health Research Board Summer Studentship;This work was carried out in the Department of Clinical Therapies, University of Limerick, Limerick, Ireland.

Objective: To develop specific measures of MS-associated walking capacity through statistically sophisticated HPA analysis, thereby more precisely defining the real-world impact of disease. Methods: Eighty-eight MS and 38 control subjects completed timed walks and patient-reported outcomes in clinic, then wore an accelerometer for 7 days. HPA was analyzed with several new statistics, including the maximum step rate (MSR) and habitual walking step rate (HWSR), along with conventional methods, including average daily steps. HPA statistics were validated using clinical walking outcomes. Results: The six-minute walk (6MW) step rate correlated most strongly with MSR (r = 0.863, p < 10(-25)) and HWSR (r = 0.815, p < 10(-11)) rather than average daily steps (r = 0.676, p < 10(-11)). The combination of MSR and HWSR correlated more strongly with the 6 MW step rate than either measure alone (r = 0.884, p < 10(-14)). The MSR overestimated the 6 MW step rate (mu= 10.4, p < 10(-7)), whereas the HWSR underestimated it (mu=-18.2, p < 10(-19)). Conclusions: Conventional HPA statistics are poor measures of capacity due to variability in activity behaviors. The MSR and HWSR are valid, specific measures of real-world capacity which capture subjects' highest step rate and preferred step rate, respectively.;"[Engelhard, Matthew M.; Patek, Stephen D.] Univ Virginia, Dept Syst & Informat Engn, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; [Lach, John C.] Univ Virginia, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA";Goldman, MD (corresponding author), Univ Virginia, Dept Neurol, POB 800394, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA.;mdg3n@virginia.edu;"Goldman, Myla D/D-1955-2017; Goldman, Myla/AAG-8737-2020";Goldman, Myla/0000-0002-5675-945X;"National Institutes of Health - National Institute of Neurologic Disorders and StrokeUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS) [K23NS062898]; Broadband Wireless Access and Applications Center, an NSF-supported industry-university cooperative research center (NSF) [1266311]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS) [K23NS062898, K23NS062898, K23NS062898, K23NS062898, K23NS062898] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER";MDG is funded by the National Institutes of Health - National Institute of Neurologic Disorders and Stroke (K23NS062898).

Patients' walking ability is critical for assessing the EDSS, the disability scale commonly used in MS clinical practice. Such assessment is usually based on patients' estimates or on the measures the neurologists observe during periodic visits. Objectives and methods: We evaluated the agreement between patients' and neurologists' estimates of maximum walking ability and patients' mean maximum walking ability measured in their daily life through a GPS smartwatch, and assessed limitations of the current methods. Results: Seventy-three patients with a median walking ability of 500 m (IQR 400-800) were enrolled in the study. The agreement between patients' estimates and GPS measurements was modest (ICC 0.29, 95% CIs 0.06-0.49) and was influenced by course of the disease, patients' mood and inaccuracy at estimating long distances. A better reliability was found between neurologists' and GPS measures (ICC 0.68, 95% CIs 0.53-0.78), but the variability increased for longer distances and was influenced by patients' depressive symptoms, fatigue and course of the disease. Conclusions: This study showed a poor agreement between patients' and neurologists' estimates of maximum walking ability and patients' mean maximum walking ability measured in their daily life through a GPS smartwatch, with many factors affecting patient's and neurologists' estimates of the EDSS. The use of remote measurement technologies may provide a better understanding of the impact of MS in a patient's life.;"[Dalla-Costa, Gloria; Radaelli, Marta; Maida, Simona; Sangalli, Francesca; Colombo, Bruno; Moiola, Lucia; Comi, Giancarlo; Martinelli, Vittorio] Osped San Raffaele, Dept Neurol, Via Olgettina 48, I-20132 Milan, Italy";Martinelli, V (corresponding author), Osped San Raffaele, Dept Neurol, Via Olgettina 48, I-20132 Milan, Italy.;martinelli.vittorio@hsr.it;"Moiola, Lucia/AAN-5568-2020; Sangalli, Francesca/AAA-6086-2019; Costa, Gloria Dalla/F-6440-2017; Martinelli, Vittorio/AAN-7240-2020";"Sangalli, Francesca/0000-0002-3401-0018; Costa, Gloria Dalla/0000-0002-8761-9337; moiola, lucia/0000-0001-6313-4952";Acesm Onlus;We would like to thank all our patients for their enthusiastic participation, and Acesm Onlus for supporting this study.;;11;7;7;0;0;ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV;AMSTERDAM;PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;0022-510X;1878-5883;;J NEUROL SCI;J.

Their levels are tightly maintained in all body organs. Impairment of the Zn2+ to Cu2+ ratio in serum was found to correlate with many disease states, including immunological and inflammatory disorders. Oxytocin (OT) is a neuropeptide, and its activity is modulated by zinc and copper ion binding. Harnessing the intrinsic properties of OT is one of the attractive ways to develop valuable metal ion sensors. Here, we report for the first time an OT-based metal ion sensor prepared by immobilizing the neuropeptide onto a glassy carbon electrode. The developed impedimetric biosensor was ultrasensitive to Zn2+ and Cu2+ ions at physiological pH and not to other biologically relevant ions. Interestingly, the electrochemical impedance signal of two hemicircle systems was recorded after the attachment of OT to the surface. These two semicircles suggest two capacitive regions that result from two different domains in the OT monolayer. Moreover, the change in the charge-transfer resistance of either Zn2+ or Cu2+ was not similar in response to binding. This suggests that the metal-dependent conformational changes of OT can be translated to distinct impedimetric data. Selective masking of Zn2+ and Cu2+ was used to allow for the simultaneous determination of zinc to copper ions ratio by the OT sensor. The OT sensor was able to distinguish between healthy control and multiple sclerosis patients diluted sera samples by determining the Zn/Cu ratio similar to the state-of-the-art techniques. The OT sensor presented herein is likely to have numerous applications in biomedical research and pave the way to other types of neuropeptide-derived sensors.;"[Tadi, Kiran Kumar; Alshanski, Israel; Mervinetsky, Evgeniy; Gilon, Chaim; Hurevich, Mattan; Yitzchaik, Shlomo] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Inst Chem, IL-9190401 Jerusalem, Israel; [Tadi, Kiran Kumar; Alshanski, Israel; Mervinetsky, Evgeniy; Yitzchaik, Shlomo] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Ctr Nanosci & Nanotechnol, IL-9190401 Jerusalem, Israel; [Marx, Gerard] MX Biotech Ltd, IL-95744 Jerusalem, Israel; [Petrou, Panayiota; Dimitrios, Karussis M.] Hadassah Hebrew Univ Hosp, Dept Neurol, IL-91120 Jerusalem, Israel";"Hurevich, M; Yitzchaik, S (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Inst Chem, IL-9190401 Jerusalem, Israel.; Yitzchaik, S (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Ctr Nanosci & Nanotechnol, IL-9190401 Jerusalem, Israel.";"mattan.hurevich@mail.huji.ac.il; shlomo.yitzchaik@mail.huji.ac.il";"; Tadi, Kiran Kumar/I-3992-2017";"Yitzchaik, Shlomo/0000-0001-5021-5139; Alshanski, Israel/0000-0002-9310-1921; Tadi, Kiran Kumar/0000-0002-8647-9379; Hurevich, Mattan/0000-0002-1038-8104";European Union's Horizon research and innovation programme [664786];The authors would like to thank RECORD-IT project.

In virtue of modern fabrication modes and detection techniques, various immunosensing platforms have been reported on basis of the specific recognition between antigen-antibody pairs. In addition to profit from the development of nanotechnology and molecular biology, diverse fabrication and signal amplification strategies have been designed for detection of protein antigens, which has led to great achievements in fast quantitative and simultaneous testing with extremely high sensitivity and specificity. Besides antigens, determination of antibodies also possesses great significance for clinical laboratory diagnosis. In this review, we will categorize recent immunosensors for proteins by different detection techniques. The basic conception of detection techniques, sensing mechanisms, and the relevant signal amplification strategies are introduced. Since antibodies and antigens have an equal position to each other in immunosensing, all biosensing strategies for antigens can be extended to antibodies under appropriate optimizations. Biosensors for antibodies are summarized, focusing on potential applications in clinical laboratory diagnosis, such as a series of biomarkers for infectious diseases and autoimmune diseases, and an evaluation of vaccine immunity. The excellent performances of these biosensors provide a prospective space for future antibody-detection-based disease serodiagnosis.;"[Liu, Xuan] Southeast Univ, Affiliated Hosp 2, Dept Clin Lab, Nanjing 210003, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Hui] Southeast Univ, Sch Biol Sci & Med Engn, Nanjing 210096, Jiangsu, Peoples R China";Jiang, H (corresponding author), Southeast Univ, Sch Biol Sci & Med Engn, Nanjing 210096, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;"silentsign@163.com; sungi@seu.edu.cn";;;"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [21205012, 21675023]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu ProvinceNatural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK2012077, BK20161413]; Nanjing Medical Science and Technique Development Foundation";We gratefully acknowledge the support of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant 21205012, 21675023), the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (Grant BK2012077, BK20161413), and the Nanjing Medical Science and Technique Development Foundation.;;125;8;8;2;27;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;1424-8220;;SENSORS-BASEL;Sensors;DEC;2017;17;12;;;;;;;2805;10.3390/s17122805;;;23;"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation";"Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation";FT6TD;WOS:000423285800105;29207528;DOAJ Gold, Green Published;;;2021-03-18;

Behaviour change interventions may assist people with MS to increase physical activity and reduce sedentary behaviour. However, few studies have investigated their effectiveness using objective measures of physical activity, particularly in the long term. Further, interventions that have proven effective in the short term may not be feasible in clinical practice because of the large amount of support provided. The iStep-MS trial aims to determine the safety, feasibility and acceptability of a behaviour change intervention to increase physical activity and reduce sedentary behaviour among people with MS. Methods and analysis Sixty people with MS will be randomised (1: 1 ratio) to receive a 12-week intervention or usual care only. The intervention consists of four physical activity consultations with a physiotherapist supported by a handbook and pedometer. Outcomes assessed at baseline, 12 weeks and 9 months are physical activity (ActiGraph wGT3X-BT accelerometer), sedentary behaviour (activPAL3 mu), self-reported activity and sitting time, walking capability, fatigue, self-efficacy, participation, quality of life and health service use. The safety of the intervention will be determined by assessing change in pain and fatigue and the incidence of adverse events during the follow-up period. A parallel process evaluation will assess the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention through assessment of fidelity to the programme and semistructured interviews exploring participants' and therapists' experiences of the intervention. The feasibility of conducting an economic evaluation will be determined by collecting data on quality of life and resource use. Ethics and dissemination Research ethics committee approval has been granted from Brunel University London. Results of the trial will be submitted for publication in journals and distributed to people with MS and physiotherapists.;"[Ryan, Jennifer M.; Fortune, Jennifer; Stennett, Andrea; Kilbride, Cherry; Victor, Christina; DeSouza, Lorraine; Lavelle, Grace; Norris, Meriel] Brunel Univ London, Inst Environm Hlth & Soc, Ageing Studies Theme, Uxbridge, Middx, England; [Anokye, Nana] Brunel Univ London, Inst Environm Hlth & Soc, Hlth Econ Theme, London, England; [Hendrie, Wendy] MS Therapy Ctr, Norwich, Norfolk, England; [Abdul, Mohamed] Berkshire MS Therapy Ctr, Reading, Berks, England; [Brewin, Debbie; David, Lee] 10 Minute CBT, Letchworth Garden City, England";Ryan, JM (corresponding author), Brunel Univ London, Inst Environm Hlth & Soc, Ageing Studies Theme, Uxbridge, Middx, England.;Jennifer.Ryan@brunel.ac.uk;Fortune, Jennifer/ABF-2845-2020;"Ryan, Jennifer/0000-0003-3768-2132; Fortune, Jennifer/0000-0001-8971-1236";MS Society, UK [53];This study is funded by a project grant from the MS Society, UK (award reference: 53).;;63;5;5;1;8;BMJ PUBLISHING GROUP;LONDON;BRITISH MED ASSOC HOUSE, TAVISTOCK SQUARE, LONDON WC1H 9JR, ENGLAND;2044-6055;;;BMJ OPEN;BMJ Open;NOV;2017;7;11;;;;;;;e018875;10.1136/bmjopen-2017-018875;;;13;Medicine, General & Internal;General & Internal Medicine;FT1MA;WOS:000422898800252;29146660;DOAJ Gold;;;2021-03-18;

The purpose of this study was to examine relationships between trunk and foot acceleration variability during walking in healthy controls and in persons with multiple sclerosis. Methods: Linear and nonlinear variability measures were calculated for 40 healthy controls and 40 persons with multiple sclerosis from the acceleration time series recorded by inertial sensors attached to the trunk and foot while subjects walked on a treadmill at self-selected preferred pace. Findings: No main effect of group was found for any variability measures. Main effect of location was found for all variability measures, with larger magnitudes of variability at the foot compared to the trunk, and more predictable variability patterns at the foot compared to the trunk. Differences in strength of correlations between trunk and foot accelerations were found between persons with multiple sclerosis and healthy controls in the frontal and sagittal plane. Sample entropy of accelerations at the feet and at the trunk correlated significantly higher in healthy controls than in persons with multiple sclerosis. Interpretation: Relationships between variability of trunk and foot accelerations, which may provide a valuable comprehensive description of whole body stability during gait, showed minor changes in persons with MS compared to healthy controls.;"[Craig, Jordan J.; Bruetsch, Adam P.; Huisinga, Jessie M.] Univ Kansas, Med Ctr, Landon Ctr Aging, 3901 Rainbow Blvd,Mail Stop 1005, Kansas City, KS 66160 USA; [Craig, Jordan J.; Huisinga, Jessie M.] Univ Kansas, Bioengn Grad Program, 3135A Learned Hall,1530 W 15th St, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Lynch, Sharon G.; Huisinga, Jessie M.] Univ Kansas, Med Ctr, Dept Neurol, 3901 Rainbow Blvd,Mail Stop 2002, Kansas City, KS 66160 USA";Huisinga, JM (corresponding author), Univ Kansas, Med Ctr, 3900 Rainbow Blvd,Mail Stop 1005, Kansas City, KS 66160 USA.;jhuisinga@kumc.edu;;Huisinga, Jessie/0000-0002-4249-1421;"National Multiple Sclerosis SocietyNational Multiple Sclerosis Society [RG 4914A1/2]; NIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences [1KL2TR00011]; NIH Ruth L.

'Timed up and go' (TUG) has been recently tested in MS as functional mobility test, as it is able to evaluate ambulation/coordination-related tasks, as well as cognitive function related to mobility. The objective of this study is to evaluate the relationship between brain volumes and TUG performances. Inclusion criteria were a diagnosis of MS and the ability to walk at least 20 m. TUG was performed using a wearable inertial sensor. Times and velocities of TUG sub-phases were calculated by processing trunk acceleration data. Patients underwent to a brain MRI, and volumes of whole brain, white matter (WM), grey matter (GM), and cortical GM (C) were estimated with SIENAX. Sixty patients were enrolled. Mean age was 41.5 +/- 11.6 years and mean EDSS 2.3 +/- 1.2. Total TUG duration was correlated to lower WM (rho = 0.358, p = 0.005) and GM (rho = 0.309, p = 0.017) volumes. A stronger association with lower GM volume was observed for intermediate (rho = 0.427, p = 0.001) and final turning (rho = 0.390, p = 0.002). TUG is a useful tool in a clinical setting as it can not only evaluate patients' disability in terms of impaired functional mobility, but also estimate pathological features, such as grey atrophy.;"[Lorefice, Lorena; Coghe, G.; Fenu, G.; Frau, J.; Marrosu, M.

Yet there is no method to objectively measure tremor and effectiveness of interventions on tremor. This study aimed to test validity and reliability of a new objective measurement for upper limb tremor in people with multiple sclerosis. Method: Twelve participants with multiple sclerosis who self-reported tremor were observed performing standardised tasks. Validity and reliability of a new method to detect tremor from wrist movement was established against occupational therapist observation of tremor (FAHN). Concurrent validity of severity (displacement) of tremor was assessed. Responsiveness to change in tremor characteristics was explored in a sub-set of participants using weighted wrist-cuffs. Results: The new method correctly predicted 98.2% of tremor cases identified by the occupational therapist, with high sensitivity (0.988) and specificity (0.976). Calculated displacement of tremor correlated with FAHN tremor severity scores moderately (rs=.452, p=.004). The new measure was responsive to changes in tremor characteristics due to change in weight of wrist-cuffs. Conclusion: The new method of characterising tremor in those with multiple sclerosis demonstrated excellent validity and reliability in relation to tremor identified by an occupational therapist, and could provide valuable objective insight into the efficacy of interventions.;"[Teufl, Stefan] Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Sch Hlth & Life Sci, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Preston, Jenny] NHS Ayrshire & Arran, Irvine, Scotland; [van Wijck, Frederike] Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Sch Hlth & Life Sci, Neurol Rehabil, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Stansfield, Ben] Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Sch Hlth & Life Sci, Hlth Engn, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland";Teufl, S (corresponding author), Sch Hlth & Life Sci, Govan Mbeki Bldg,Cowcaddens Rd, Glasgow G4 0BA, Lanark, Scotland.;stefan.teufl@gcu.ac.uk;;;MS Society, UK [1139257/SC041990, 968/12];"This research was funded as part of a research grant from the MS Society, UK (Registered charity nos 1139257/SC041990; Reference: 968/12).";;19;2;2;1;2;SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD;LONDON;1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND;0308-0226;1477-6006;;BRIT J OCCUP THER;Br.

In this study, we aimed to assess the existence of possible differences in spatial- temporal parameters and smoothness of gait measures (assessed through Harmonic Ratio, HR) obtained from trunk accelerations between 50 pwMS without disability (Expanded Disability Status Scale score = 1) and 50 age- matched healthy controls. The results show no differences in terms of gait velocity, stride length, stance/ swing and double support phases duration, while HR in the direction of motion was significantly lower in pwMS (2.92 vs. 3.67, p < 0.001), thus indicating a less smooth gait. The study of trunk accelerations through calculation of HR represents a fast, non- intrusive technique that allows early identification of anomalies in gait patterns of pwMS in absence of disability.;"[Pau, Massimiliano; Mandaresu, Serena; Pilloni, Giuseppina; Porta, Micaela] Univ Cagliari, Dept Mech Chem & Mat Engn, Piazza Armi, I-09123 Cagliari, Italy; [Mandaresu, Serena; Porta, Micaela; Coghe, Giancarlo; Marrosu, Maria Giovanna; Cocco, Eleonora] Univ Cagliari, Multiple Sclerosis Ctr, Dept Med Sci & Publ Hlth, Cagliari, Italy";Pau, M (corresponding author), Univ Cagliari, Dept Mech Chem & Mat Engn, Piazza Armi, I-09123 Cagliari, Italy.;massimiliano.pau@dimcm.unica.it;"Cocco, Eleonora/G-5064-2012; Pau, Massimiliano/P-7878-2014";"Cocco, Eleonora/0000-0002-3878-8820; Pau, Massimiliano/0000-0001-9835-3629";Fondazione di SardegnaFondazione Banco di Sardegna [FBS 2012.0794, FBS 2014.1175];This study was partly supported by Fondazione di Sardegna (grants FBS 2012.0794 and FBS 2014.1175).;;18;17;17;0;5;ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD;CLARE;ELSEVIER HOUSE, BROOKVALE PLAZA, EAST PARK SHANNON, CO, CLARE, 00000, IRELAND;0966-6362;1879-2219;;GAIT POSTURE;Gait Posture;OCT;2017;58;;;;;;307;309;;10.1016/j.gaitpost.2017.08.023;;;3;"Neurosciences; Orthopedics; Sport Sciences";"Neurosciences & Neurology; Orthopedics; Sport Sciences";FM7EH;WOS:000415234200051;28858779;;;;2021-03-18;

The purpose of this study was to explore Sample Entropy (SampEn) from wearable sensor data as a measure of variability of spontaneous infant leg movement and as a potential marker of the development of neuromotor control. We hypothesized that infants at risk (AR) of developmental delay would present significantly lower SampEn values than infants with typical development (TD). Participants were 11 infants with TD and 20 infants AR. We calculated SampEn from 1-4 periods of data of 7200 samples in length when the infants were actively playing across the day. The infants AR demonstrated smaller SampEn values (median 0.21) than the infants with TD (median 1.20). Lower values of SampEn indicate more similarity in patterns across time, and may indicate more repetitive, less exploratory behavior in infants AR compared to infants with TD. In future studies, we would like to expand to analyze longer periods of wearable sensor data and/or determine how to optimally sample representative periods across days and months.;"[Smith, Beth A.] Univ Southern Calif, Div Biokinesiol & Phys Therapy, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Vanderbilt, Douglas L.] Univ Southern Calif, Keck Sch Med, Div Gen Pediat, Dept Pediat, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Applequist, Bryon] Univ Scranton, Dept Exercise Sci & Sport, Scranton, PA 18510 USA; [Kyvelidou, Anastasia] Creighton Univ, Dept Phys Therapy, Omaha, NE 68178 USA";Smith, BA (corresponding author), Univ Southern Calif, Div Biokinesiol & Phys Therapy, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.;"beth.smith@usc.edu; dvanderbilt@chla.usc.edu; bryon.applequist@scranton.edu; anastasiakyvelidou@creighton.edu";"Kyvelidou, Anastasia/W-3223-2019; Smith, Beth A./D-2914-2014";"Kyvelidou, Anastasia/0000-0001-7560-3648; Smith, Beth A./0000-0003-2531-5394; Vanderbilt, Douglas/0000-0003-2038-0808";"American Physical Therapy Association Section on Pediatrics Research Grant; Foundation for Physical Therapy (NIFTI);  [K12-HD055929]; EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH & HUMAN DEVELOPMENTUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [K12HD055929, K12HD055929, K12HD055929, K12HD055929, K12HD055929] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL CENTER FOR ADVANCING TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) [UL1TR001855, UL1TR001855, UL1TR001855, UL1TR001855, UL1TR001855, UL1TR001855] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER";"Thank you to the infants and their families.

Design: Cross-sectional observational study Setting: Clinical setting Subjects: Convenience sample of 52 people with MS and 52 matched healthy controls Interventions: NA Main measures: Participants scored 15 statements assessing fatigue, pain, anxiety and quality of life on an electronic visual analogue scale (eVAS), either using a smartphone or a tablet (randomly allocated). To check for test-retest reliability, statements were administered in two separate randomly ordered groups. Subjects completed a feasibility questionnaire. Results: Mean (SD) eVAS scores ranged from 35 (28.1) to 80 (22.1) in MS group, and from 57 (28.0) to 86 (13.2) in controls. Intra Class Correlations ranged from 0.73 to 0.95 in MS sample; 0.61 to 0.92 in controls.

Peroxynitrite is a short-lived oxidant species that is a potent inducer of cell death. Uric acid (UA) can scavenge the peroxynitrite to avoid the formation of nitrotyrosine, which is formed from the reaction between peroxynitrite and tyrosine (Try). Scavenging the peroxynitrite avoids the inactivation of cellular enzymes and modification of the cytoskeleton. Reduced level of UA decreases the ability of the body from preventing the peroxynitrite toxicity. On the other hand, the abnormal level of UA leads to gout and hyperuricemia. Allopurinol (AP) is administered in UA lowering therapy. Thus, the simultaneous determination of UA, Try and AP using N-CDs modified glassy carbon (GC) electrode was demonstrated for the first time. Initially, N-CDs were prepared from L-asparagine by pyrolysis and characterized by different spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. The HR-TEM image shows that the average size of the prepared N-CDs was 1.8 +/- 0.03 nm. Further, the N-CDs were directly attached on GC electrode by simple immersion, follows Micheal's nucleophilic addition. XPS of N-CDs shows a peak at 285.3 eV corresponds to the formation of C-N bond. The GC/N-CDs electrode shows higher electrocatalytic activity towards UA, Tyr and AP by not only shifting their oxidation potentials toward less positive potential but also enhanced their oxidation currents in contrast to bare GC electrode. The GC/N-CDs electrode shows the limit of detection of 13x10(-10) M (S/N=3) and the sensitivity of 924 A mM(-1) cm(-2) towards the determination of UA. Finally, the N-CDs modified electrode was utilized for the determination of UA, Tyr and AP in human blood serum and urine samples.;"[Gowthaman, N. S.

Summary of Key Points: Efficacy for these devices remains unclear, although preliminary data indicate that specific patient populations may benefit from robotic training used with more traditional physical therapy. Potential benefits include improved lower-limb function and a more typical gait trajectory. Statement of Conclusions: Use of these devices is limited by insufficient data, cost, and in some cases size of the machine. However, robotic technology is likely to become more prevalent as these machines are enhanced and able to produce targeted physical rehabilitation.

Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: University medical center balance disorder laboratory. Participants: Total sample N=73; persons with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) n=52; healthy controls n=21. Main Outcome Measures: Stepping latency, time and number of steps required to reach stability, and initial step length were calculated using 3 inertial measurement units placed on participants' lumbar spine and feet. Results: Correlations between inertial sensor measures and measures obtained from the laboratory-based systems were moderate to strong and statistically significant for all variables: time to release (r=.992), latency (r=.655), time to stability (r=.847), time of first heel strike (r=.665), number of steps (r=.825), and first step length (r=.592). Compared with healthy controls, PwMS demonstrated a longer time to stability and required a larger number of steps to reach stability.

The aim of this study was to assess the criterion validity of the activPAL3 activity monitor during overground walking in people with MS. Validity of the activPAL3 accelerometer was compared to video observation in 20 people moderately affected by MS. Participants walked 20-30 m twice along a straight quiet corridor at a comfortable speed. Inter-rater reliability of video observations was excellent (all intraclass correlations >0.99). The mean difference (activPAL3- mean of raters) was -4.70 +/- 9.09, -4.55 s +/- 10.76 and 1.11 s +/- 1.11 for steps taken, walking duration and upright duration respectively. These differences represented 8.7%, 10.0% and 1.8% of the mean for each measure respectively. The activPAL3 tended to underestimate steps taken and walking duration in those who walked at cadences of <= 38 steps min by 60% and 47%, respectively. The activPAL3 is valid for measuring walking activity in people moderately affected by MS. It is accurate for upright duration regardless of cadence. In participants with slow walking cadences,, outcomes of steps taken and walking duration should be interpreted with caution. (C) 2017 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Clinical tools and instrumental techniques are available for testing static and dynamic balance, but the relationship between such abilities is still not clear. Having information about this link would be important in properly planning the type and number of tests to administer. Methods: One hundred and six pwMS (Expanded Disability Status Scale, EDSS 0 - 6.5) stratified in three subgroups (Class 1 EDSS 0-1.5, Class 2 EDSS 2-4 and Class 3 EDSS 4.5-6.5) and 42 healthy controls (HC) participated in the study. All underwent static posturography and instrumented Timed-Up-and-Go (TUG) performed using a wearable inertial sensor. Raw data were processed to extract postural sway features, overall duration of TUG and its main sub-phases (i.e. sit-to-stand, 180 degrees turns and stand-to-sit). Results: All sway parameters of pwMS of Classes 2 and 3, as well as total TUG duration and time necessary to perform 180 degrees turns, were found significantly higher than HC and Class 1 participants. However, poor correlations were found between sway and TUG parameters. When pwMS are grouped, small/moderate correlations (in the range 0.20-0.41) were found between all sway parameters and total TUG duration. Conclusions: Static and dynamic balance in pwMS appear scarcely correlated, although both worsen as disability increases. This implies that they should be separately assessed using specific tests to have a complete view of postural control performance in MS.;"[Pau, Massimiliano; Porta, Micaela; Corona, Federica; PilIoni, Giuseppina] Univ Cagliari, Dept Mech Chem & Mat Engn, Cagliari, Italy; [Coghe, Giancarlo; Lorefice, Lorena; Marrosu, Maria Giovanna; Cocco, Eleonora] Univ Cagliari, Dept Med Sci & Publ Hlth, Multiple Sclerosis Ctr, Cagliari, Italy";Pau, M (corresponding author), Univ Cagliari, Dept Mech Chem & Mat Engn, Cagliari, Italy.;massimiliano.pau@dimcm.unica.it;"Cocco, Eleonora/G-5064-2012; Pau, Massimiliano/P-7878-2014";"Cocco, Eleonora/0000-0002-3878-8820; Pau, Massimiliano/0000-0001-9835-3629; Lorefice, Lorena/0000-0003-2050-2908";Fondazione SardegnaFondazione Banco di Sardegna [FBS 2012.0794, FBS 2014.1175];This study was partly supported by Fondazione Sardegna (Grants FBS 2012.0794 and FBS 2014.1175).;;46;11;11;1;9;ELSEVIER SCI LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND;2211-0348;2211-0356;;MULT SCLER RELAT DIS;Mult.

However, assessment of gait speed in coordination with delivery of comprehensive care is usually constrained to clinical environments and is often limited due to mounting demands on the availability of trained clinical staff. These limitations in assessment design could give rise to poor ecological validity and limited ability to tailor interventions to individual patients. Recent advances in wearable sensor technologies have fostered the development of new methods for monitoring parameters that characterize mobility impairment, such as gait speed, outside the clinic, and therefore address many of the limitations associated with clinical assessments. However, these methods are often validated using normal gait patterns; and extending their utility to subjects with gait impairments continues to be a challenge. In this paper, we present a machine learning method for estimating gait speed using a configurable array of skin-mounted, conformal accelerometers. We establish the accuracy of this technique on treadmill walking data from subjects with normal gait patterns and subjects with multiple sclerosis-induced gait impairments. For subjects with normal gait, the best performing model systematically overestimates speed by only 0.01 m/s, detects changes in speed to within less than 1%, and achieves a root-mean-square-error of 0.12 m/s. Extending these models trained on normal gait to subjects with gait impairments yields only minor changes in model performance. For example, for subjects with gait impairments, the best performing model systematically overestimates speed by 0.01 m/s, quantifies changes in speed to within 1%, and achieves a root-mean-square-error of 0.14 m/s. Additional analyses demonstrate that there is no correlation between gait speed estimation error and impairment severity, and that the estimated speeds maintain the clinical significance of ground truth speed in this population.

Wireless inertial sensors can accurately measure numerous walking and balance parameters but these measures require evaluation of reliability in PwMS. The current study determined the test-retest reliability of wireless inertial sensor measures obtained during an instrumented standing balance test and an instrumented Timed Up and Go test in PwMS. Methods: Fifteen PwMS and 15 healthy control subjects (HC) performed an instrumented standing balance and instrumented Timed Up and Go (TUG) test on two separate days. Ten instrumented standing balance measures and 18 instrumented TUG measures were computed from the wireless sensor data. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated to determine test-retest reliability of all instrumented standing balance and instrumented TUG measures. Correlations were evaluated between the instrumented standing balance and instrumented TUG measures and self-reported walking and balance performance, fall history, and clinical disability. Results: For both groups, ICCs for instrumented standing balance measures were best for spatio-temporal measures, while frequency measures were less reliable. All instrumented TUG measures exhibited good to excellent (ICCs > 0.60) test-retest reliability in PwMS and in HC. There were no correlations between self-report walking and balance scores and instrumented TUG or instrumented standing balance metrics, but there were correlations between instrumented TUG and instrumented standing balance metrics and fall history and clinical disability status. Conclusions: Measures from the instrumented standing balance and instrumented TUG tests exhibit good to excellent reliability, demonstrating their potential as objective assessments for clinical trials. A subset of the most reliable measures is recommended for measuring walking and balance in clinical settings.;"[Craig, Jordan J.; Bruetsch, Adam P.; Huisinga, Jessie M.] Univ Kansas, Med Ctr, Landon Ctr Aging, 3901 Rainbow Blvd,Mail Stop 1005, Kansas City, KS 66160 USA; [Craig, Jordan J.; Huisinga, Jessie M.] Univ Kansas, Bioengn Grad Program, 3135A Learned Hall,1530 W 15th St, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Lynch, Sharon G.; Huisinga, Jessie M.] Univ Kansas, Med Ctr, Dept Neurol, 3901 Rainbow Blvd,Mail Stop 2002, Kansas City, KS 66160 USA; [Horak, Fay B.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Neurol, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Pk Rd,L226, Portland, OR 97239 USA";"Huisinga, JM (corresponding author), Univ Kansas, Med Ctr, Landon Ctr Aging, 3901 Rainbow Blvd,Mail Stop 1005, Kansas City, KS 66160 USA.; Huisinga, JM (corresponding author), Univ Kansas, Bioengn Grad Program, 3135A Learned Hall,1530 W 15th St, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.";jhuisinga@kumc.edu;;;"National Multiple Sclerosis SocietyNational Multiple Sclerosis Society [RG 4914A1/2]; NIH National Center for Advancing Translational Science [1KL2TR00011]; NIH Ruth L.

In this study we focused our attention on the trisaccharide human natural killer cell-1 (HNK-1), considered the antigenic determinant of myelin-associated glycoprotein and the target of clinically relevant auto-antibodies in autoimmune neurological disorders such as IgM monoclonal gammopathy and demyelinating polyneuropathy. We describe a structure-activity relationship study based on surface plasmon resonance binding affinities aimed at the optimization of a peptide that mimics the HNK-1 minimal epitope. We developed a cyclic heptapeptide that shows an affinity of 1.09 x 10(-7) m for a commercial anti-HNK1 mouse monoclonal antibody. Detailed conformational analysis gave possible explanations for the good affinity displayed by this novel analogue, which was subsequently used as an immunological probe. However, preliminary screening indicates that patients' sera do not specifically recognize this peptide, showing that murine monoclonal antibodies cannot be used as a guide to select immunological probes for the detection of clinically relevant human auto-antibodies.;"[Ieronymaki, Matthaia; Nuti, Francesca; Rossi, Giada; Real-Fernandez, Feliciana; Sabatino, Giuseppina; Papini, Anna Maria; Rovero, Paolo] PeptLab, Lab Peptide & Prot Chem & Biol, Via Lastruccia 13, I-50019 Sesto Fiorentino, Italy; [Ieronymaki, Matthaia; Nuti, Francesca; Sabatino, Giuseppina; Papini, Anna Maria] Univ Florence, Dept Chem Ugo Schiff, Via Lastruccia 13, I-50019 Sesto Fiorentino, Italy; [Brancaccio, Diego; Novellino, Ettore; Carotenuto, Alfonso] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Pharm, Via D Montesano 49, I-80131 Naples, Italy; [Rossi, Giada; Real-Fernandez, Feliciana; Rovero, Paolo] Univ Florence, Sect Pharmaceut Sci & Nutraceut, Dept Neurosci Psychol Drug Res & Child Hlth, Via Ugo Schiff 6, I-50019 Sesto Fiorentino, Italy; [Cao, Yihong; Monasson, Olivier; Larregola, Maud; Peroni, Elisa; Uziel, Jacques; Papini, Anna Maria] Univ Cergy Pontoise, UCP Platform, PeptLab, 5 Mail Gay Lussac, F-95031 Cergy Pontoise, France; [Cao, Yihong; Monasson, Olivier; Larregola, Maud; Peroni, Elisa; Uziel, Jacques; Papini, Anna Maria] Univ Cergy Pontoise, Lab Chem Biol EA4505, 5 Mail Gay Lussac, F-95031 Cergy Pontoise, France";"Papini, AM; Rovero, P (corresponding author), PeptLab, Lab Peptide & Prot Chem & Biol, Via Lastruccia 13, I-50019 Sesto Fiorentino, Italy.; Papini, AM (corresponding author), Univ Florence, Dept Chem Ugo Schiff, Via Lastruccia 13, I-50019 Sesto Fiorentino, Italy.; Rovero, P (corresponding author), Univ Florence, Sect Pharmaceut Sci & Nutraceut, Dept Neurosci Psychol Drug Res & Child Hlth, Via Ugo Schiff 6, I-50019 Sesto Fiorentino, Italy.; Papini, AM (corresponding author), Univ Cergy Pontoise, UCP Platform, PeptLab, 5 Mail Gay Lussac, F-95031 Cergy Pontoise, France.; Papini, AM (corresponding author), Univ Cergy Pontoise, Lab Chem Biol EA4505, 5 Mail Gay Lussac, F-95031 Cergy Pontoise, France.";"annamaria.papini@unifi.it; paolo.rovero@unifi.it";"Carotenuto, Alfonso/C-8491-2014; Fernandez, Feliciana Real/L-7897-2015; Nuti, Francesca/L-6282-2015; Papini, Anna Maria/AAZ-5204-2020";"Carotenuto, Alfonso/0000-0001-7532-5449; Fernandez, Feliciana Real/0000-0001-5747-2285; Nuti, Francesca/0000-0001-9908-5996; Papini, Anna Maria/0000-0002-2947-7107; Uziel, Jacques/0000-0002-5511-2902; Peroni, Elisa/0000-0002-5153-2934; Larregola, Maud/0000-0002-9196-3552; Monasson, olivier/0000-0002-0886-1687";"ANR Chaire d'Excellence PeptKitFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-09-CEXC-013-01]; Ente Cassa di Risparmio di";ANR Chaire d'Excellence PeptKit 2009-2014 (grant no.

Here, a novel label-free microfluidic electrochemical (EC) biosensor with a unique built-in on-chip regeneration capability for continual measurement of cell-secreted soluble biomarkers from an organoid culture in a fully automated manner without attenuating the sensor sensitivity is reported. The microfluidic EC biosensors are integrated with a human liver-on-a-chip platform for continual monitoring of the metabolic activity of the organoids by measuring the levels of secreted biomarkers for up to 7 d, where the metabolic activity of the organoids is altered by a systemically applied drug. The variations in the biomarker levels are successfully measured by the microfluidic regenerative EC biosensors and agree well with cellular viability and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analyses, validating the accuracy of the unique sensing platform. It is believed that this versatile and robust microfluidic EC biosensor that is capable of automated and continual detection of soluble biomarkers will find widespread use for long-term monitoring of human organoids during drug toxicity studies or efficacy assessments of in vitro platforms.;"[Shin, Su Ryon; Kilic, Tugba; Zhang, Yu Shrike; Avci, Huseyin; Hu, Ning; Kim, Duckjin; Branco, Cristina; Aleman, Julio; Massa, Solange; Silvestri, Antonia; Kang, Jian; Desalvo, Anna; Chae, Su-Kyoung; Polini, Alessandro; Bhise, Nupura; Dokmeci, Mehmet R.; Khademhosseini, Ali] Harvard Med Sch, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Biomat Innovat Res Ctr, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02139 USA; [Shin, Su Ryon; Kilic, Tugba; Zhang, Yu Shrike; Avci, Huseyin; Hu, Ning; Kim, Duckjin; Branco, Cristina; Aleman, Julio; Massa, Solange; Silvestri, Antonia; Kang, Jian; Desalvo, Anna; Chae, Su-Kyoung; Polini, Alessandro; Bhise, Nupura; Dokmeci, Mehmet R.; Khademhosseini, Ali] MIT, Harvard MIT Div Hlth Sci & Technol, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Kilic, Tugba] Izmir Katip Celebi Univ, Fac Engn & Architecture, Dept Biomed Engn, TR-35620 Izmir, Turkey; [Avci, Huseyin] Eskisehir Osmangazi Univ, Fac Engn & Architecture, Dept Met & Mat Engn, TR-26040 Eskisehir, Turkey; [Hu, Ning] Zhejiang Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Key Lab Biomed Engn, Biosensor Natl Special Lab,Minist Educ, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Branco, Cristina; Silvestri, Antonia; Kang, Jian] Politecn Torino, DET, Corso Duca Abruzzi 24, I-10129 Turin, Italy; [Massa, Solange] Univ Los Andes, Programa Doctorado Biomed, Santiago 7620001, Chile; [Hussaini, Mohammed Abdullah; Hussain, Mohammad Asif] King Abdulaziz Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia; [Lee, HeaYeon] Northeastern Univ, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Khademhosseini, Ali] Konkuk Univ, Coll Anim Biosci & Technol, Dept Bioind Technol, Seoul 05029, South Korea; [Khademhosseini, Ali] King Abdulaziz Univ, Dept Phys, Jeddah 21569, Saudi Arabia";"Shin, SR; Dokmeci, MR; Khademhosseini, A (corresponding author), Harvard Med Sch, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Biomat Innovat Res Ctr, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02139 USA.; Shin, SR; Dokmeci, MR; Khademhosseini, A (corresponding author), MIT, Harvard MIT Div Hlth Sci & Technol, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.; Khademhosseini, A (corresponding author), Konkuk Univ, Coll Anim Biosci & Technol, Dept Bioind Technol, Seoul 05029, South Korea.; Khademhosseini, A (corresponding author), King Abdulaziz Univ, Dept Phys, Jeddah 21569, Saudi Arabia.";"sshin4@partners.org; mdokmeci@rics.bwh.harvard.edu; alik@bwh.harvard.edu";"Hussain, Mohammad A/K-3524-2012; Zhang, Yu Shrike/H-4885-2013; Khademhosseini, Ali/A-9435-2010; Polini, Alessandro/A-2077-2012";"Zhang, Yu Shrike/0000-0002-0045-0808; Khademhosseini, Ali/0000-0002-2692-1524; Polini, Alessandro/0000-0002-3188-983X; KILIC, TUGBA/0000-0001-8600-0367; Aleman, Julio/0000-0001-7530-3303";"Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) under Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center Pacific (SSC PACIFIC) [N6601-13-C-2027]; Institute for Soldier Nanotechnology; National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [HL092836, EB012597, AR057837, HL099073]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DMR0847287]; ONR PECASE Award [11-NAN1544-03]; Air Force Office of Sponsored ResearchUnited States Department of DefenseAir Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) [FA9550-15-1-0273]; Office of Naval Research Young Investigator awardOffice of Naval Research; NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI) [K99CA201603, K99CA201603] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI) [R01HL092836, R01HL099073, R01HL099073, R01HL092836, R01HL099073, R01HL092836, R01HL092836, R01HL099073, R01HL092836, R01HL092836] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ARTHRITIS AND MUSCULOSKELETAL AND SKIN DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Arthritis & Musculoskeletal & Skin Diseases (NIAMS) [R01AR057837, R01AR057837, R01AR057837, R01AR057837, R01AR057837, R01AR057837, R01AR057837, R01AR057837, R01AR057837, R01AR057837, R01AR057837] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF BIOMEDICAL IMAGING AND BIOENGINEERINGUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Biomedical Imaging & Bioengineering (NIBIB) [R01EB012597, R01EB012597, R01EB012597, R01EB012597] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER";S.R.S., T.K., and Y.S.Z. contributed equally to this work.

The current meta-analysis quantified physical activity participation levels in persons with MS compared with non-diseased and other clinical populations. Methods: We searched PUBMED, PsycINFO and Web of Science using the keywords physical activity, exercise, and physical fitness in conjunction with MS. We conducted a quantitative synthesis of the difference in physical activity participation levels among persons with MS compared with non-diseased populations and other clinical populations and then examined moderators that might explain variation in the overall effect size (ES). Results: 21 studies were included involving 5303 persons with MS and yielded a mean ES of -0.57 (95% CI=-0.76, 60.37). The weighted mean ES was heterogeneous (Q=443.811, df=31, p < 0.001). The magnitude of the mean ES increased when comparing the MS population with non-diseased populations, but decreased when comparing MS with clinical populations. Conclusion: The cumulative evidence reinforces that persons with MS are less physically active than non-diseased, but not clinical populations, and this observation supports the need for new efforts on promoting physical activity across the MS community.;"[Kinnett-Hopkins, D.; Adamson, B.; Rougeau, K.] Univ Illinois, Dept Kinesiol & Community Hlth, Champaign, IL USA; [Motl, R.

Yet, understanding how MS symptoms co-vary and associate with physical and psychological health is unclear. Objective: The purpose of the study was to explore variability patterns and time-bound relationships across symptoms, affect, and physical activity in individuals with MS. Methods: The study employed a multivariate, replicated, single-subject repeated-measures (MRSRM) design and involved four individuals with MS. Mood, fatigue, pain, balance confidence, and losses of balance were measured daily over 28 days by self-report. Physical activity was also measured daily over this same time period via accelerometry. Dynamic factor analysis (DFA) was used to determine the dimensionality and lagged relationships across the variables. Results: Person-specific models revealed considerable time-dependent co-variation patterns as well as pattern variation across subjects. Results also offered insight into distinct variability structures at varying levels of disability.

Traditional diagnosis of autoimmune disease is primarily based on physician assessment combined with core laboratory tests. However, these tests are not sensitive enough to detect early molecular events, and quite often, it is too late to control these autoimmune diseases and reverse tissue damage when conventional tests show positivity for disease. It is fortunate that during the past decade, research in nanotechnology has provided enormous opportunities for the development of ultrasensitive biosensors in detecting early biomarkers with high sensitivity. Biosensors consist of a biorecognition element and a transducer which are able to facilitate an accurate detection of proinflammatory molecules, autoantibodies and other disease-causing molecules. Apparently, novel biosensors could be superior to traditional metrics in assessing the drug efficacy in clinical trials, especially when specific biomarkers are indicative of the pathogenesis of disease. Furthermore, the portability of a biosensor enables the development of pointof- care devices. In this review, various types of biomolecule sensing systems, including electrochemical, optical and mechanical sensors, and their applications and future potentials in autoimmune disease treatment were discussed.;"[Zhang, Xuezhu; Zambrano, Amarayca; Lin, Zuan-Tao; Xing, Yikun; Rippy, Justin; Wu, Tianfu] Univ Houston, Dept Biomed Engn, 3605 Cullen Blvd, Houston, TX 77204 USA";Wu, TF (corresponding author), Univ Houston, Dept Biomed Engn, 3605 Cullen Blvd, Houston, TX 77204 USA.;twu13@central.uh.edu;"Lin, Zuantao/L-9544-2018; Wu, Tianfu/G-6672-2019";"Lin, Zuantao/0000-0001-5054-3773; Rippy, Justin/0000-0001-5251-9400; Wu, Tianfu/0000-0003-4406-1449";"Lupus Research Institute; University of Houston";This work is partly supported by the Lupus Research Institute and the startup fund from the University of Houston (to T.

One of the MSOAC goals is acceptance and qualification by regulators of performance outcomes that are highly reliable and valid, practical, cost-effective, and meaningful in MS. This article addresses the history, application, and psychometric properties of one such MSOAC metric of ambulation or walking namely, the timed 25-foot walk (T25FW). The T25FW has strong reliability over both brief and long periods of time in MS across a large range of disability levels. The outcome of walking speed from the T25FW has obvious real-world relevance and has correlated strongly with other measures of walking and lower extremity function. The T25FW is responsive for capturing intervention effects in pharmacological and rehabilitation trials and has an established value for capturing clinically meaningful change in ambulation. Directions for future research involve validating clinically meaningful improvements on the T25FW as well as determining whether 20% change is clinically meaningful across the disability spectrum. Researchers might further consider synchronizing accelerometers and motion sensors with the T25FW for capturing walking speed in everyday life and the patient's real environment.;"[Motl, Robert W.] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Phys Therapy, 336 SHPB, Birmingham, AL 35233 USA; [Cohen, Jeffrey A.] Cleveland Clin, Mellen Ctr, Neurol Inst, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Benedict, Ralph] Univ Buffalo, Dept Neurol, Buffalo, NY USA; [Phillips, Glenn; Rudick, Richard] Biogen, Cambridge, MA USA; [LaRocca, Nicholas] Natl Multiple Sclerosis Soc, New York, NY USA; [Hudson, Lynn D.] Crit Path Inst, Tucson, AZ USA; [Multiple Sclerosis Outcome] Crit Path Inst, MSOAC, Tucson, AZ USA";Motl, RW (corresponding author), Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Phys Therapy, 336 SHPB, Birmingham, AL 35233 USA.;robmotl@uab.edu;;;National Multiple Sclerosis SocietyNational Multiple Sclerosis Society [RG 4869-A-1];The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (grant number RG 4869-A-1 to the Critical Path Institute).

Purpose: This study examined changes in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) over a 30-month time period and the demographic and clinical predictors of such changes in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). Methods: 269 persons with MS wore an accelerometer for a 7-day period and completed a demographic/clinical scale every 6 months over a 30-month period. Data were analyzed using latent class growth modeling (LCGM). Results: LCGM identified a two-class model for changes in levels of MVPA over time. Class 1 involved higher initial levels of MVPA and linear decreases in MVPA over time, whereas Class 2 involved lower initial levels of MVPA and linear increases in MVPA over time. LCGM further indicated that males were more likely (OR = 5.8, P <.05) and those with higher disability status were less likely (OR = 0.51, P <.05) to belong to Class 1 than Class 2. Conclusion: Levels of MVPA change over time in persons with RRMS and the pattern of change suggests that behavioral physical activity interventions for persons with MS might target men and those with lower disability.;"[Klaren, Rachel E.; McAuley, Edward] Univ Illinois, Dept Kinesiol & Community Hlth, Champaign, IL 61801 USA; [Sasaki, Jeffer E.] Univ Fed Triangulo Mineiro, Nucleo Estudos Atividade Fis & Saude NEAFISA, Uberaba, MG, Brazil; [Motl, Robert W.] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Phys Therapy, Birmingham, AL USA";Klaren, RE (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Kinesiol & Community Hlth, Champaign, IL 61801 USA.;klaren2@illinois.edu;Sasaki, Jeffer/L-6001-2013;Sasaki, Jeffer/0000-0002-2083-4104;;;;22;5;6;0;1;HUMAN KINETICS PUBL INC;CHAMPAIGN;1607 N MARKET ST, PO BOX 5076, CHAMPAIGN, IL 61820-2200 USA;1543-3080;1543-5474;;J PHYS ACT HEALTH;J.

Methods: Seven days of activity monitor data were collected for 26 participants with MS (age =44.5 +/- 11.9 years; time since diagnosis = 6.5 +/- 6.2 years; Patient Determined Disease Steps = <= 3). Mean daily step count and mean daily EE (kcal) were calculated for all combinations of days (127 combinations), and compared to the respective 7-day mean daily step count or mean daily EE using intra-class correlations (ICC), the Generalizability Theory and Bland-Altman. Results: For step count, ICC values of 0.94-0.98 and a G-coefficient of 0.81 indicate a minimum of any random 2-day combination is required to reliably calculate mean daily step count. For EE, ICC values of 0.96-0.99 and a G-coefficient of 0.83 indicate a minimum of any random 4-day combination is required to reliably calculate mean daily EE. For Bland-Altman analyses all combinations of days, bar single day combinations, resulted in a mean bias within +/- 10%, when expressed as a percentage of the 7-day mean daily step count or mean daily EE. Conclusions: A minimum of 2 days for step count and 4 days for EE, regardless of day type, is needed to reliably estimate daily step count and daily EE, in people with MS who walk unaided.

Here, we apply a novel wireless, skin-mounted, and conformal inertial sensor (BioStampRC, MC10 Inc.) to examine gait characteristics of PwMS under controlled conditions. We determine the accuracy and precision of BioStampRC in measuring gait kinematics by comparing to contemporary research-grade measurement devices. Methods A total of 45 PwMS, who presented with diverse walking impairment (Mild MS = 15, Moderate MS = 15, Severe MS = 15), and 15 healthy control subjects participated in the study. Participants completed a series of clinical walking tests. During the tests participants were instrumented with BioStampRC and MTx (Xsens, Inc.) sensors on their shanks, as well as pan activity monitor GT3X (Actigraph, Inc.) on their non-dominant hip. Shank angular velocity was simultaneously measured with the inertial sensors. Step number and temporal gait parameters were calculated from the data recorded by each sensor. Visual inspection and the MTx served as the reference standards for computing the step number and temporal parameters, respectively. Accuracy (error) and precision (variance of error) was assessed based on absolute and relative metrics. Temporal parameters were compared across groups using ANOVA. Results Mean accuracy precision for the BioStampRC was 2 2 steps error for step number, 6 +/- 9ms error for stride time and 6 +/- 7ms error for step time (0.6-2.6% relative error). Swing time had the least accuracy precision (25 +/- 19ms error, 5 4% relative error) among the parameters. GT3X had the least accuracy precision (8 +/- 14% relative error) in step number estimate among the devices. Both MTx and BioStampRC detected significantly distinct gait characteristics between PwMS with different disability levels (p<0.01). Conclusion BioStampRC sensors accurately and precisely measure gait parameters in PwMS across diverse walking impairment levels and detected differences in gait characteristics by disability level in PwMS. This technology has the potential to provide granular monitoring of gait both inside and outside the clinic.;"[Moon, Yaejin; Sosnoff, Jacob J.] Univ Illinois, Dept Kinesiol & Community Hlth, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [McGinnis, Ryan S.] Univ Vermont, Dept Elect & Biomed Engn, Burlington, VT USA; [Seagers, Kirsten; Sheth, Nirav; Wright, John A., Jr.; Ghaffari, Roozbeh] MC10 Inc, Lexington, MA USA; [Motl, Robert W.] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Phys Therapy, Birmingham, AL USA";Sosnoff, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Kinesiol & Community Hlth, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.;jsosnoff@illinois.edu;Sosnoff, Jacob/P-3397-2019;"Sosnoff, Jacob/0000-0002-0286-9207; McGinnis, Ryan/0000-0001-8396-6967; Moon, Yaejin/0000-0002-1187-6847";MC10 Inc.;JJS received funding from MC10 Inc. for this research.

We sought to determine whether remote step count monitoring using a consumer-friendly accelerometer (Fitbit Flex) can enhance MS disability assessment. 99 adults with relapsing or progressive MS able to walk >= 2-min were prospectively recruited. At 4 weeks, study retention was 97% and median Fitbit use was 97% of days. Substudy validation resulted in high interclass correlations between Fitbit, ActiGraph and manual step count tally during a 2-minute walk test, and between Fitbit and ActiGraph (ICC = 0.76) during 7-day home monitoring. Over 4 weeks of continuous monitoring, daily steps were lower in progressive versus relapsingMS(mean difference 2546 steps, p < 0.01). Lower average daily step count was associated with greater disability on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) (p < 0.001). Within each EDSS category, substantial variability in step count was apparent (i.e., EDSS = 6.0 range 1097-7152). Step count demonstrated moderate-strong correlations with other walking measures. Lower average daily step count is associated with greater MS disability and captures important variability in real-world walking activity otherwise masked by standard disability scales, including the EDSS. These results support remote step count monitoring as an exploratory outcome in MS trials.;"[Block, V. J.; Allen, D.

Objective: This study examined if objectively-measured moderate-to-vigorous (MVPA) and light (LPA) physical activity and sedentary behavior were associated with peak aerobic capacity (VO(2)peak) measured using an established protocol for conducting a maximal, incremental exercise test in persons with MS. Methods: The study involved a cross-sectional, observational study design and included 49 persons with MS. Participants wore an accelerometer around the waist during the waking hours for a 7-day period as a measure of physical activity and sedentary behaviors, and completed a maximal, incremental exercise test on an electronically-braked, computer-controlled cycle ergometer with open-circuit spirometry for measuring VO(2)peak. Results: VO(2)peak was significantly correlated with MVPA (r = 0.53, p < 0.001) and LPA (r = 0.39, p < 0.01), but not sedentary behavior (r = 0.12, p = 0.44). Linear regression analysis indicated that MVPA (B = 0.19, SE B = 0.04, beta = 0.51, p < 0.001) and LPA (B = 0.02, SE B = 0.01, beta = 0.30, p < 0.05), but not sedentary behavior (B = 0.01, SE B = 0.01, beta = 0.14, p = 0.26), explained significant variance in VO(2)peak (R-2 = 0.40). Conclusion: We provide the first evidence that MVPA and LPA represent concurrent correlates of VO(2)peak and both could be targeted for improving aerobic capacity in persons with MS.

We here aimed to explore two standard methods (subjective plus objective) to assess PA reduction in PwMS and to describe the relation of PA to health-related quality of life (hrQoL). Methods: PA was objectively measured over a 7-day period in 26 PwMS (EDSS 1.5-6.0) and 30 matched healthy controls (HC) using SenseWear mini (R) armband (SWAmini) and reported as step count, mean total and activity related energy expenditure (EE) as well as time spent in PA of different intensities. Measures of EE were also derived from self-assessment with IPAQ (International Physical Activity Questionnaire) long version, which additionally yielded information on the context of PA and a classification into subjects' PA levels. To explore the convergence between both types of assessment, IPAQ categories (low, moderate, high) were related to selected PA parameters from objective assessment using ANOVA. Group differences and associated effect sizes for all PA parameters as well as their relation to clinical and hrQoL measures were determined. Results: Both, SWAmini and IPAQ assessment, captured differences in PA between PwMS and HC. IPAQ categories fit well with common cut-offs for step count (p = 0.002) and mean METs (p = 0.004) to determine PA levels with objective devices. Correlations between specifically matched pairs of IPAQ and SWAmini parameters ranged between r.288 and r.507. Concerning hrQoL, the lower limb mobility subscore was related to four PA measures, while a relation with patients' report of general contentment was only seen for one. Conclusions: Both methods of assessment seem applicable in PwMS and able to describe reductions in daily PA at group level. Whether they can be used to track individual effects of interventions to enhance PA levels needs further exploration. The relation of PA measures with hrQoL seen with lower limb mobility suggests lower limb function not only as a major target for intervention to increase PA but also as a possible surrogate for PA changes.;"[Krueger, Theresa; Behrens, Janina R.; Grobelny, Anuschka; Bellmann-Strobl, Judith; Brandt, Alexander U.; Paul, Friedemann; Schmitz-Huebsch, Tanja] Charite Univ Med Berlin, Clin Neuroimmunol Grp, NeuroCure Clin Res Ctr, Charitepl 1, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Behrens, Janina R.; Bellmann-Strobl, Judith; Brandt, Alexander U.; Paul, Friedemann] Charite Univ Med Berlin, Dept Neurol, Charitepl 1, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Paul, Friedemann] Charite Univ Med Berlin, Expt & Clin Res Ctr, Lindenberger Weg 80, D-13125 Berlin, Germany; [Paul, Friedemann] Max Delbruck Ctr Mol Med, Lindenberger Weg 80, D-13125 Berlin, Germany; [Otte, Karen; Mansow-Model, Sebastian; Kayser, Bastian] Motognosis UG, Schonhauser Allee 177, D-10119 Berlin, Germany";Schmitz-Hubsch, T (corresponding author), Charite Univ Med Berlin, Clin Neuroimmunol Grp, NeuroCure Clin Res Ctr, Charitepl 1, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.;Tanja.schmitz-huebsch@charite.de;Paul, Friedemann/ABF-9415-2020;;Novartis GmbH (Roonstrasse, Numberg, Germany);This work was supported by Novartis GmbH (Roonstrasse 25, 90429 Numberg, Germany).;;62;10;10;0;24;BMC;LONDON;CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND;1471-2377;;;BMC NEUROL;BMC Neurol.;JAN 13;2017;17;;;;;;;;10;10.1186/s12883-016-0783-0;;;12;Clinical Neurology;Neurosciences & Neurology;EI0CT;WOS:000392140400001;28086828;DOAJ Gold, Green Accepted, Green Published;;;2021-03-18;

Robotic exoskeletons may facilitate walking and induce better control during walking leading to coordinated muscle activity, reducing metabolic and cognitive demands. The purpose of this study was to determine the magnitude of variation in cognitive demands in persons with MS during exoskeleton assisted and unassisted walking. Eight subjects diagnosed with MS and expanded disability status scale (EDSS) between 6.0 and 7.5 completed up to 15 sessions of exoskeleton-assisted gait training. After training, cognitive demands were measured by a reaction time (RT) task during Timed 25 feet walk (T25FW). The subjects performed the RT task during both with and without exoskeleton walking. No difference was observed in RT during assisted and unassisted walking. The preliminary findings suggest that individuals with MS could walk with exoskeleton without greater cognitive demands.;"[Afzal, Taimoor; Francisco, Gerard; Chang, Shuo-Hsiu] TIRR Mem Hermann, NeuroRecovery Res Ctr, Ctr Wearable Exoskeletons, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Afzal, Taimoor; Lincoln, John; Francisco, Gerard; Chang, Shuo-Hsiu] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Kern, Marcie] TIRR Mem Hermann, Houston, TX USA; [Tseng, Shih-Chiao] Texas Womans Univ, Houston, TX USA";"Chang, SH (corresponding author), TIRR Mem Hermann, NeuroRecovery Res Ctr, Ctr Wearable Exoskeletons, Houston, TX 77030 USA.; Chang, SH (corresponding author), Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Houston, TX 77030 USA.";shuo-hsiu.chang@uth.tmc.edu;AFZAL, TAIMOOR/D-7272-2018;AFZAL, TAIMOOR/0000-0002-2060-398X;National Multiple Sclerosis SocietyNational Multiple Sclerosis Society;The authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.

A wearable biosensor not only has the potential to enhance physical exams, but also offers the promise of remote evaluations of the patient either at home or with local non-specialist providers.Areas covered: We performed a structured literature review on the use of wearable biosensors in studies of multiple sclerosis. This included accelerometers, gyroscopes, eye-trackers, grip sensors, and multi-sensors.Expert commentary: Wearable sensors that are sensitive to change in function over time have great potential to serve as outcome metrics in clinical trials. Key features of generalizability are simplicity in the application of the device and delivery of data to the provider. Another important feature to establish is best sampling rate. Having too high of a sampling rate can lead to over-interpretation of noisy data On the other hand, a low sampling rate can result in an insensitive test thus missing subtle changes of clinical interest. Of most importance is to establish metrics derived from wearable devices that provide meaningful data in longitudinal studies.;"[Yousef, Andrew; Jonzzon, Soren; Suleiman, Leena; Arjona, Jennifer; Graves, Jennifer S.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Neurol, San Francisco, CA USA";Yousef, A (corresponding author), 1700 8th Ave, San Francisco, CA 94122 USA.;Andrew.yousef@ucsf.edu;;;;;;75;10;10;2;8;TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1743-4440;1745-2422;;EXPERT REV MED DEVIC;Expert Rev.

Although diffusion weighted imaging is useful in broadly assessing white matter structure, it has limited utility in identifying specific underlying neurobiological components, such as myelin. The purpose of the present study was to explore relationships between myelination and impairment, function and activity in individuals with chronic stroke. Assessments of paretic upper-extremity impairment and function were administered, and 72-hour accelerometer based activity monitoring was conducted on 19 individuals with chronic stroke. Participants completed a magnetic resonance imaging protocol that included a high resolution T-1 anatomical scan and a multi-component T-2 relaxation imaging scan to quantify myelin water fraction (MWF). MWF was automatically parcellated from pre- and post-central subcortical regions of interest and quantified as an asymmetry ratio (contralesional/ipsilesional). Cluster analysis was used to group more and less impaired individuals based on Fugl-Meyer upper extremity scores. A significantly higher precentral MWF asymmetry ratio was found in the more impaired group compared to the less impaired group (p < 0.001). There were no relationships between MWF asymmetry ratio and upper-limb use. Stepwise multiple linear regression identified precentral MWF asymmetry as the only variable to significantly predict impairment and motor function in the upper extremity (UE). These results suggest that asymmetric myelination in a motor specific brain area is a significant predictor of upper-extremity impairment and function in individuals with chronic stroke. As such, myelination may be utilized as a more specific marker of the neurobiological changes that predict long term impairment and recovery from stroke. (C) 2017 The Authors.

This study investigated PA levels in persons with MS as a function of fall risk categories. Forty-seven persons with MS participated in the study and were categorized into either increased fall risk (IFR; n = 21; 55.5 +/- 9.0 years) or normal fall risk (NFR; n = 26; 51.2 +/- 12.9 years) groups based on scores from the Activities-Balance Confidence scale. PA was measured by accelerometer and expressed as average steps per day, and time spent in sedentary behavior, light PA, and moderate to vigorous physical activity over the course of 7 consecutive days. Univariate and covariate analyses were used to compare the differences in PA between fall risk groups. The average steps per day of the NFR group was significant higher compared with the IFR group (6024 +/- 2533.1 vs. 2599 +/- 1622.7 steps; P < 0.001), and the difference remained after controlling for disability level (5351 +/- 2298.6 vs. 3432 +/- 2363.6 steps; P = 0.016). There were no differences in light PA and moderate to vigorous physical activity between groups after controlling for disability level.

OBJECTIVE: To examine differences in metrics of mobility, postural control, and cognition in persons with MS with distinct fall risk status; and to investigate predictors of fall risk group membership using discriminant analysis. METHODS: Forty-seven persons with MS completed the Activities-Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale and underwent a battery of assessments of mobility, balance, and cognition. Participants further wore an accelerometer for 7 days as an assessment of steps/day. Participants were allocated into fall risk groups based on ABC scale scores (increased fall risk (IFR); and normal fall risk (NFR)). We examined univariate differences between groups using ANOVA, and discriminant function analysis (DFA) identified the significant multivariate predictors of FR status. RESULTS: After controlling for disability level, the IFR group had significantly (p < 0.05) worse scores on measures of mobility (i.e., MSWS-12, 6MW, and steps/day) compared to the NFR group. DFA identified MSWS-12 and 6 MW scores as significant (p < 0.05) predictors of fall risk group membership. Those two variables collectively explained 55% of variance in fall risk grouping.

To measure dynamic balance during walking, margin of stability (MoS) examines how the extrapolated center of mass moves relative to the base of support. This study investigates how MoS is affected in PwMS during walking at preferred, slow, and fast speeds, as well as the relationship between MoS and the Expanded Disability Severity Score (EDSS), fall history, and self-report balance confidence questionnaire. MoS was evaluated in PwMS without clinical gait impairment (MS1; n=20), PwMS with clinical gait impairment (MS2; n=20), and age-matched healthy controls (HC) (n=20), in the anterior/posterior (AP) and medial/lateral (ML) direction at heel strike and midstance. In the AP direction, MS2 had a higher MoS than HC (p < 0.001) and MS1 (p < 0.001) at heel strike and midstance. In the ML direction, MS2 had a higher MoS than HC (p < 0.001) at heel strike only. At midstance, slow pace had a lower MoS than preferred pace (p < 0.001) and fast pace (p=0.007). Compared to HC, PwMS walk slower which increases their AP MoS. In the ML direction, slow walking causes lower MoS at midstance, so PwMS increase their MoS by taking wider steps. AP MoS correlated with EDSS (p=0.008) and number of falls (p=0.001), and ML MoS correlated with number of falls (p=0.027). Walking slower, with shorter step length, and with wider step widths increases MoS for PwMS but may be a poor adaptive gait strategy since falls still occur. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Glycosylation changes are accompanied by changes in physiological state, which may be associated with certain types of diseases such as cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, etc. In recent years, this issue has been attracting more and more scientists and enormous advances have been achieved in this field. This work is focused on the use of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) in combination with lectin biosensors and biochips enabling tracking glycosylation and its changes. SPR is commonly used to detect proteins and to study the protein-protein and protein-drug interactions. Lectin SPR biochips additionally allow us to detect the glycan (glycoprotein)-lectin (protein) interactions. The great advantage of SPR, as compared to most other methods used for this purpose, is the possibility of real-time and label-free measurements. On the other hand, the measurement of large number of samples is time consuming. This is possible to overcome by using the SPR imaging (SPRi) techniques allowing simultaneous measurement of several samples. Practical applications of the lectin SPR biosensors and biochips are not only in biology and biomedicine research and diagnosis of diseases and detection of pathogenic microorganisms, but also in environmental monitoring, food control and even in the military for the detection of substances based on glycoprotein toxins.;"[Sediva, Alena; Katrlik, Jaroslav] Slovenska Akad Vied, Chem Ustav, Oddelenie Glykobiotechnol, Dubravska Cesta 9, Bratislava 84538, Slovakia";Sediva, A (corresponding author), Slovenska Akad Vied, Chem Ustav, Oddelenie Glykobiotechnol, Dubravska Cesta 9, Bratislava 84538, Slovakia.;"a.sediva@savba.sk; chemjkat@savba.sk";Katrlik, Jaroslav/C-9240-2011;Katrlik, Jaroslav/0000-0002-2876-9298;;;;62;0;0;0;8;CHEMICKE LISTY;PRAGUE 6;NOVOTNEHO LAVKA 5, PRAGUE 6 116 68, CZECH REPUBLIC;0009-2770;1213-7103;;CHEM LISTY;Chem.

We hypothesized that greater physical activity goal setting and physical activity self-efficacy would be associated with greater levels of vigorous physical activity in youth with multiple sclerosis. Study design A total of 68 consecutive patients (27 multiple sclerosis, 41 mono-ADS) and 37 healthy controls completed fatigue, depression, Physical Activity Self-Efficacy Scale, perceived disability, Exercise Goal-Setting scale, and physical activity questionnaires, and wore an accelerometer for 7 days. All patients had no ambulatory limitations (Expanded Disability Status Scale, scores all <4). Results Youth with multiple sclerosis engaged in fewer minutes per day of vigorous (P=.009) and moderate and vigorous physical activity (P=.048) than did patients with mono-ADS and healthy controls. A lower proportion of the group with multiple sclerosis (63%) reported participating in any strenuous physical activity than the mono-ADS (85%) and healthy control (89%) groups (P=.020). When we adjusted for age and sex, the Physical Activity Self-Efficacy Scale and Exercise Goal-Setting scale were associated positively with vigorous physical activity in the group with multiple sclerosis. Fatigue and depression did not predict physical activity or accelerometry metrics. Conclusions Youth with multiple sclerosis participate in less physical activity than their counterparts with mono-ADS and healthy controls.

The aim of this trial was to assess the efficacy of treadmill training and progressive strength training on walking in people with MS. MethodsA single blinded randomized parallel group trial was carried out. Eligible participants were adults with MS with Expanded Disability Status Scale score 6. A total of 29 participants were randomized and 28 received the allocated exercise intervention, treadmill (n=13) or strength training (n=15). Both groups exercised 30minutes, three times a week for 8weeks. Primary outcome was The Functional Ambulation Profile evaluated by the GAITRite walkway. Secondary outcomes were walking work economy and balance control during walking, measured by a small lightweight accelerometer connected to the lower back. Testing was performed at baseline and the subsequent week after completion of training. ResultsTwo participants were lost to follow-up, and 11 (treadmill) and 15 (strength training) were left for analysis. The treadmill group increased their Functional Ambulation Profile score significantly compared with the strength training group (p=.037). A significant improvement in walking work economy (p=.024) and a reduction of root mean square of vertical acceleration (p=.047) also favoured the treadmill group. DiscussionThe results indicate that task-specific training by treadmill walking is a favourable approach compared with strength training to improve walking in persons with mild and moderate MS. Implications for Physiotherapy practice, this study adds knowledge for the decision of optimal treatment approaches in people with MS.

Despite the prevalence of rollators, analysis of their use outside of controlled environments has received relatively little attention. This Letter reports on an initial study to characterise rollator movement. An inertial measurement unit (IMU) was used to measure the motion of the rollator and analytical approaches were developed to extract features characterising the rollator movement, properties of the surface and push events. The analytics were tested in two situations: first, a healthy participant used a rollator in a laboratory using a motion capture system to obtain ground truth. Second, the IMU was used to measure the movement of a rollator being used by a user with multiple sclerosis on a flat surface, cross-slope, up and down slopes and up and down a step. The results showed that surface inclination and distance travelled measured by the IMU have close approximation to the results from ground truth; therefore, demonstrating the potential for IMU-derived metrics to characterise rollator movement and user's pushing style in the outdoor environment.";"[Cheng, Tsu-Jui; Kenney, Laurence; Thies, Sibylle Brunhilde; Costamagna, Eleonora] Univ Salford, Ctr Hlth Sci Res, Salford M6 6PU, Lancs, England; [Amor, James David; James, Christopher] Univ Warwick, Sch Engn, Warwick Engn Biomed, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Holloway, Catherine] UCL, Dept Comp Sci, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England";Cheng, TJ (corresponding author), Univ Salford, Ctr Hlth Sci Res, Salford M6 6PU, Lancs, England.;t.j.cheng@salford.ac.uk;James, Christopher/AAV-4770-2020;"Kenney, Laurence/0000-0003-2164-3892; Thies, Sibylle/0000-0001-9889-2243; Cheng, Tsu-Jui/0000-0003-2775-6396; Holloway, Catherine/0000-0001-7843-232X";Engineering and Physical Sciences Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/M025543/1];"This work has been supported by Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council grant EP/M025543/1.

Objective The present study aimed to evaluate the Kinect V2 sensor against a gold standard motion capture system with respect to accuracy of tracked landmark movements and accuracy and repeatability of derived clinical parameters. Methods Nineteen healthy subjects were concurrently recorded with a Kinect V2 sensor and an optical motion tracking system (Vicon). Six different movement tasks were recorded with 3D full-body kinematics from both systems. Tasks included walking in different conditions, balance and adaptive postural control. After temporal and spatial alignment, agreement of movements signals was described by Pearson's correlation coefficient and signal to noise ratios per dimension. From these movement signals, 45 clinical parameters were calculated, including ranges of motions, torso sway, movement velocities and cadence. Accuracy of parameters was described as absolute agreement, consistency agreement and limits of agreement. Intra-session reliability of 3 to 5 measurement repetitions was described as repeatability coefficient and standard error of measurement for each system. Results Accuracy of Kinect V2 landmark movements was moderate to excellent and depended on movement dimension, landmark location and performed task. Signal to noise ratio provided information about Kinect V2 landmark stability and indicated larger noise behaviour in feet and ankles. Most of the derived clinical parameters showed good to excellent absolute agreement (30 parameters showed ICC(3,1) > 0.7) and consistency (38 parameters showed r > 0.7) between both systems. Conclusion Given that this system is low-cost, portable and does not require any sensors to be attached to the body, it could provide numerous advantages when compared to established markeror wearable sensor based system. The Kinect V2 has the potential to be used as a reliable and valid clinical measurement tool.;"[Otte, Karen; Kayser, Bastian; Mansow-Model, Sebastian] Motognosis UG Hattungsbeschrankt, Berlin, Germany; [Verrel, Julius] Max Planck Inst Human Dev, Ctr Lifespan Psychol, Berlin, Germany; [Paul, Friedemann; Brandt, Alexander U.; Schmitz-Hubsch, Tanja] Charite Univ Med Berlin, NeuroCure Clin Res Ctr, Berlin, Germany; [Paul, Friedemann; Brandt, Alexander U.; Schmitz-Hubsch, Tanja] Charite Univ Med Berlin, Clin & Expt Multiple Sclerosis Res Ctr, Berlin, Germany; [Paul, Friedemann; Schmitz-Hubsch, Tanja] Charite Univ Med Berlin, Dept Neurol, Berlin, Germany; [Paul, Friedemann; Brandt, Alexander U.] Max Delbruck Ctr Mol Med, Expt & Clin Res Ctr, Berlin, Germany; [Paul, Friedemann; Brandt, Alexander U.] Charite Univ Med Berlin, Berlin, Germany";Otte, K (corresponding author), Motognosis UG Hattungsbeschrankt, Berlin, Germany.;karen.otte@rinotognosis.com;Paul, Friedemann/ABF-9415-2020;Verrel, Julius/0000-0001-5850-5202;Motognosis UG;The company Motognosis UG provided support in the form of salaries for authors KO, BK and SMM, but did not have any additional role in the study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.

The utility of a validated screening tool for clinical settings is unknown. This study evaluated the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ) as a measure of PA in POMS. Methods: POMS patients (n=27) and healthy controls (n=45) wore an accelerometer over a 7-day period and then completed the GLTEQ. Results: The GLTEQ captured expected group differences in PA for vigorous, moderate, and moderate-to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), confirmed by accelerometry. There was a large, positive correlation between GLTEQ and accelerometry scores for vigorous PA in POMS (r=0.736, p =0.001), and a nearly significant and moderate, positive correlation between MVPA scores (r= 0.319, p=.053). Conclusion: We provide evidence that supports the validity of GLTEQ scores as measures of vigorous and MVPA in POMS. Researchers and clinicians might adopt this scale for measuring PA.

However, such instruments tend to be expensive and require expert operation and maintenance besides their high cost, thus limiting them to only a small number of specialized centers. Consequently, gait analysis in most clinics today still relies on observation-based assessment. Recent advances in wearable sensors, especially inertial body sensors, have opened up a promising future for gait analysis. Not only can these sensors be more easily adopted in clinical diagnosis and treatment procedures than their current counterparts, but they can also monitor gait continuously outside clinics - hence providing seamless patient analysis from clinics to free-living environments. The purpose of this paper is to provide a systematic review of current techniques for quantitative gait analysis and to propose key metrics for evaluating both existing and emerging methods for qualifying the gait features extracted from wearable sensors. It aims to highlight key advances in this rapidly evolving research field and outline potential future directions for both research and clinical applications.;"[Chen, Shanshan] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Biostat, Med Coll Virginia Campus, Richmond, VA 23298 USA; [Chen, Shanshan] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Internal Med, Med Coll Virginia Campus, Richmond, VA 23298 USA; [Lach, John] Univ Virginia, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA; [Lo, Benny; Yang, Guang-Zhong] Imperial Coll London, Hamlyn Ctr, London SW7 2AZ, England";"Chen, SS (corresponding author), Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Biostat, Med Coll Virginia Campus, Richmond, VA 23298 USA.; Chen, SS (corresponding author), Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Internal Med, Med Coll Virginia Campus, Richmond, VA 23298 USA.";"shanshan.chen@vcuhealth.org; jlach@virginia.edu; benny.lo@imperial.ac.uk; g.z.yang@imperial.ac.uk";"Lo, Benny/ABI-1020-2020; Chen, Shanshan/C-6240-2015; Chen, Shanshan/AAO-2763-2020; Lo, Benny/F-2155-2015";"Lo, Benny/0000-0002-5080-108X; Chen, Shanshan/0000-0003-3165-0674; Lo, Benny/0000-0002-5080-108X";;;;144;101;102;4;53;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;2168-2194;2168-2208;;IEEE J BIOMED HEALTH;IEEE J.

Methods: One hundred and five pwMS (Expanded Disability Status Scale, EDSS in the range 0-6.5) classified in three sub-groups (EDSS 0-1.5, EDSS 2-4, EDSS 4.5-6.5) and 47 healthy controls (HC) participated in the study. All the subjects were evaluated with the timed 25-foot walking test (T25FW) while wearing a commercially available accelerometer. PwMS also rated the impact of the disease on their walking abilities using the 12-item MS walking scale (MSWS-12). Results: All parameters objectively measured, except stride length, were significantly modified in pwMS with higher EDSS, with respect to HC and lower disability participants. Moderate to high correlations (r =0.57-0.79) were observed between gait parameters and MSWS-12 for pwMS of higher EDSS. The correlation was found moderate for the intermediate EDSS category (r =0.42-0.62). Conclusion: Wearable accelerometers are a useful tool for assessing gait performance for pwMS in a clinical setting, especially in cases of mild to moderate disability.

Objective: To explore the effects of PR-fampridine on different aspects of walking function and to identify associated gait modifications in subjects with MS. Methods: In this prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase II study (FAMPKIN; clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01576354), subjects received a 6-week course of oral placebo or PR-fampridine treatment (10 mg, twice daily) before crossing over. Using 3D-motion-analysis, kinematic and kinetic parameters were assessed during treadmill walking (primary endpoint). Clinical outcome measures included T25FW, 6-minute walk test (6MWT), and balance scales. Physical activity in everyday life was measured with an accelerometer device. Results: Data from 55 patients were suitable for analysis. Seventeen subjects were timed-walk responders under PR-fampridine. For the total study population and for responders, a significant increase in walking speed (T25FW) and distance (6MWT) was observed. Gait pattern changes were found at the single-subject level and correlated with improvements in the T25FW and 6MWT. Physical activity was increased in responders.

Summary measures of daily physical activity provide limited understanding of how fatigue affects physical activity behavior. This study examined the hour-by-hour energy expenditure estimated from accelerometry data to provide insight into physical activity behaviors of older people experiencing fatigue. Fatigued participants were matched to 'not fatigued' participants by age, sex, and BMI. Each group consisted of 86 people with a mean age 73.8 years (SD 2.0), BMI 26.5 kg.m(-2) (SD 3.9) and 61% female. The phase-space plot, constructed to express rate of change of average vertical axis counts per hour as a time series, showed fatigued participants deviated from the not fatigued participants during the morning period, when hour-by-hour activity was increasing. Older people who feel fatigued have a different morning activity pattern, which appears to lead to the lower overall levels of physical activity.;"[Egerton, Thorlene; Helbostad, Jorunn L.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Med, Dept Neurosci, Trondheim, Norway; [Helbostad, Jorunn L.] St Olavs Univ Hosp, Dept Clin Serv, Trondheim, Norway; [Stensvold, Dorthe] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Med, Dept Circulat & Med Imaging, KG Jebsen Ctr Exercise Med, Trondheim, Norway; [Chastin, Sebastien F.

The impact on habitual mobility and its correlation with clinical tests has not been analysed. Objective: To investigate the association between clinical response criteria and habitual mobility in MS patients starting a fampridine treatment. Methods: During a four-week baseline-to-treatment study, we assessed in 28 patients (median EDSS 4.75, range 4-6.5) walking tests as the Timed-25-Foot-Walk (T25FW) and mobility questionnaires at day 0,14 (start of treatment) and 28. Habitual steps and distance per day, total activity and walking speed was measured by accelerometry over four weeks. Beside improvement in real-life mobility, we investigated if such measures differed between non-responders and responders defined by a 20% improvement in clinical tests. Results: All clinical test, patient reported outcomes and total activity improved significantly (p < 0.05). 46% improved (any change >0) in three of four real-life measures. Change of the T25FW predicted only an increase of distance per day. Subjective rating of patients performed better by predicting distance and walking speed changes correctly. Conclusion: Fampridine might improve walking in daily life of MS, but clinical tests are weak predictors. Accelerometry opens a new perspective on mobility measurment, but the current data do not show a consistent effect on non-performance based accelerometry outcomes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This study explored the relationship between acceleration patterns at the trunk and at the foot during treadmill walking at self-selected pace in healthy adults. Forty healthy subjects walked on a treadmill for 3 minutes at self-selected speed. Root mean square (RMS) and approximate entropy (ApEn) were derived from the acceleration time series at the trunk and at the foot in the frontal and sagittal plane. RMS of accelerations at the trunk were strongly correlated with RMS values at the foot in the sagittal plane (r = 0.883, p < 0.01) and in the frontal plane (r = 0.811, p < 0.01). ApEn values at the trunk were moderately correlated with ApEn values at the foot in the sagittal plane (r = 0.603, p < 0.01) only. These results show that acceleration variability at the foot is related to acceleration variability at the trunk, specifically that increased variability at the foot is tied to increased variability at the trunk in healthy adults. Portable inertial sensors can potentially be used in any environment including a laboratory, clinic, or at home to measure lower and upper body segment motion, and assessing relationships between upper and lower body motion may provide a more comprehensive evaluation of overall stability.

Pilates exercise is often undertaken by people with multiple sclerosis (MS) who have balance and mobility difficulties. Objectives. The primary aim of the study was to compare the effects of 12 weeks of Pilates exercises with relaxation on balance and mobility. Secondary aims were: (1) to compare standardized exercises with relaxation and (2) to compare Pilates exercises with standardized exercises. Methods. A multicenter, assessor-blinded, randomized controlled trial was conducted. Participants with Expanded Disability Status Scale scores of 4.0 to 6.5 were randomly allocated to groups receiving 12 weeks of Pilates exercises, standardized exercises, or relaxation. Assessments were undertaken at baseline and weeks 12 and 16 (primary outcome measure: 10-Meter Timed Walk Test [10MTW]). Results. One hundred participants (mean age = 54 years, 74% female) were randomized to study groups. Six participants relapsed (withdrew from the study), leaving 94 participants for intention-to-treat analysis. There was no significant difference in mean 10MTW measurements between the Pilates and relaxation groups. At 12 weeks, there was a mean reduction of 4.2 seconds for the standardized exercise group compared with the relaxation group (95% confidence interval [relaxation group minus standardized exercise group measurements] = 0.0, 8.4) and a mean reduction of 3.7 seconds for the Pilates group compared with the standardized exercise group (95% confidence interval [Pilates group minus standardized exercise group measurements] = -0.4 to 7.8). At 16 weeks, mean 10MTW times for the standardized exercise group remained quicker than those for the Pilates and relaxation groups, although the differences were nonsignificant. There were no significant differences between the Pilates and relaxation groups for any secondary outcome measure. Limitations. In this study, therapists were limited to a standardized basket of exercises that may have affected the study outcomes. Furthermore, choosing measures such as posturography to assess balance, accelerometry to assess walking, or a specific trunk assessment scale might have been more responsive in detecting changes in outcome. Conclusion. Participants did not improve significantly, either in the short term or at the 4-week follow-up, on the 10MTW after 12 weeks of Pilates exercises compared with 12 weeks of relaxation.;"[Fox, Esther E.; Hough, Alan D.] Univ Plymouth, Fac Hlth & Human Sci, Plymouth, Devon, England; [Creanor, Siobhan] Univ Plymouth, Peninsula Coll Med, Plymouth, Devon, England; [Creanor, Siobhan] Univ Plymouth, Coll Dent, Plymouth, Devon, England; [Gear, Margaret] NHS Shetland, Shetland, Scotland; [Freeman, Jennifer A.] Peninsula Allied Hlth Ctr, Fac Hlth & Human Sci, Room FF21,Derriford Rd, Plymouth PL6 8BH, Devon, England";Freeman, JA (corresponding author), Peninsula Allied Hlth Ctr, Fac Hlth & Human Sci, Room FF21,Derriford Rd, Plymouth PL6 8BH, Devon, England.;jenny.freeman@plymouth.ac.uk;Creanor, Siobhan/A-9985-2018;Creanor, Siobhan/0000-0002-7373-8263;MS Trust;The authors acknowledge The MS Trust for funding the trial.;;36;27;27;0;12;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA;0031-9023;1538-6724;;PHYS THER;Phys.

Vibrotactile biofeedback of trunk sway has been shown to improve balance control in patients with peripheral and central vestibular disorders. Here, the effects of vibrotactile feedback training on trunk sway and a possible carry-over effect was measured in MS patients during stance and gait. Methods: Ten MS patients (mean age 46.8 +/- 7.7 years, 40% male) participated in a crossover study in which 7 different stance and gait tasks were trained with and without angle feedback for stance and angular velocity feedback for gait. An assessment sequence of 12 tasks was performed once before and twice after the training sequence. Trunk sway was measured with body-worn gyroscopes. Head mounted vibrotactile biofeedback of trunk sway was provided during one crossover training arm and the following second assessment sequence. Results: Biofeedback generally leads to a decrease in sway but an increase in sway angular velocities during some stance tasks compared to training without biofeedback. Biofeedback while walking eyes open resulted in a decreased sway angular velocity. The greatest changes were found in the pitch direction of trunk sway. Effects diminished after biofeedback was removed. Conclusions: This study showed that vibrotactile biofeedback of trunk sway beneficially effects stance and provides significant improvement in gait compared to training without biofeedback in MS patients.

Various analysis methods including infra-red spectroscopy, SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, and amino acid analysis have been applied for the characterization of jellyfish collagen and compared with both rat tail collagen and BSA. When comparing the two collagen types derived from jellyfish and rat tail, jellyfish collagen was observed to contain a relatively high amount of glutamic acid (61 residues/1000 residues) and alanine (63 residues/1000 residues) but low amounts of proline (113 residues/1000 residues). On the other hand, pepsin-soluble jellyfish collagen contained a small quantity of tyrosine indicating the purity of atelo-collagen. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is the main analyzing technique of the developed apta-sensor. The proposed apta-sensor has a detection limit of 6.25 nM thrombin. Clinical application were performed with analysis of the thrombin levels in blood and CSF samples obtained from patients with Multiple Sclerosis, Myastenia Gravis, Epilepsy, Parkinson, Polyneuropathy and healthy donors using both the apta-sensor and commercial ELISA kit. The results revealed the proposed system to be a promising candidate for clinical analysis of thrombin. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, there is very little known about physical activity participation in older adults with conditions such as MS. This study compared levels of physical activity (i.e., sedentary behavior, light physical activity (LPA), and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA)) and rates of meeting public health guidelines for MVPA (i.e., >= 30 min/day) among young (i.e., ages 20-39 years), middle-aged (i.e., ages 40-59 years) and older adults (i.e., ages >= 60 years) with MS. The sample included 963 persons with MS who provided demographic and clinical information and wore an accelerometer for a 7-day period. The primary analysis involved a between-subjects ANOVA on accelerometer variables (i.e., accelerometer wear time; number of valid days; sedentary behavior in min/day; LPA in min/day; and MVPA in min/day). Collectively, our data indicated that older adults with MS engaged in less MVPA and more sedentary behavior than middle-aged and young adults with MS. Such results highlight the importance of developing physical activity interventions as an effective means for managing the progression and consequences of MS in older adults.";"[Klaren, Rachel E.; Sebastiao, Emerson; Chiu, Chung-Yi; Kinnett-Hopkins, Dominique; McAuley, Edward; Motl, Robert W.] Univ Illinois, Dept Kinesiol & Community Hlth, 233 Freer Hall, Urbana, IL 61801 USA";Motl, RW (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Kinesiol & Community Hlth, 233 Freer Hall, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.;robmotl@illinois.edu;;Kinnett-Hopkins, Dominique/0000-0003-1793-3977;;;;32;21;21;0;9;INT SOC AGING & DISEASE;FORT WORTH;EDITORIAL OFF, 3400 CAMP BOWIE BLVD, FORT WORTH, TX 76106 USA;2152-5250;;;AGING DIS;Aging Dis.;JUN;2016;7;3;;;;;278;284;;10.14336/AD.2015.1025;;;7;Geriatrics & Gerontology;Geriatrics & Gerontology;DY1FJ;WOS:000384840000009;27330842;DOAJ Gold, Green Published;;;2021-03-18;

Self-reported fatigue is complex and multifactorial, with relatively little known about the causes and impacts among older people. This study tested the association between fatigue and objectively measured physical activity in a large cohort of older adults and identified factors that may explain this association. Methods: Using cross-sectional data from 980 community-living 70- to 77-year-olds, the associations between self-reported fatigue and four physical activity outcomes derived from an accelerometer-based activity monitor were tested. Attenuating effects on the association of age, gender, body mass index (BMI), physical condition, comorbidity, depression, and sleep quality were evaluated. Results: Nine percent of the sample reported being fatigued. Fatigued individuals had 1,150 fewer steps/day, 9 minutes/day less of moderatevigorous activity, 12 minutes/day less of daily activity, and 15% fewer counts/minute, when compared with those not fatigued. BMI, physical condition, and comorbidity attenuated the association, and final regression models including these variables explained most (56%-72%) of the association between fatigue and activity. Conclusions: Fatigue was associated with clinically important reductions in daily physical activity levels of older people. The findings show BMI, physical condition (in particular cardiorespiratory fitness), and comorbidity to be important factors in explaining the fatigue-physical activity association. Modification of these factors may facilitate increases in daily activity levels by lessening fatigue.;"[Egerton, Thorlene; Helbostad, Jorunn L.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Med, Dept Neurosci, N-7489 Trondheim, Norway; [Chastin, Sebastien F.

Foot sensation plays an important role in keeping the body balanced whilst walking; however, people with multiple sclerosis often have poor sensation on the soles of their feet. Wearing a specially designed shoe insole, which enhances plantar sensory information, could help people with multiple sclerosis to walk better. This study will explore whether long-term wear of a textured insole can improve walking in people with multiple sclerosis. Methods: A prospective randomised controlled trial with two parallel groups will be conducted aiming to recruit 176 people with multiple sclerosis living in the community (Brisbane, Australia). Adults with a clinical diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, Disease Steps score 1-4, who are ambulant over 100 m and who meet specific inclusion criteria will be recruited. Participants will be randomised to a smooth control insole (n = 88) or textured insole (n = 88) group. The allocated insole will be worn for 12-weeks within participants' own footwear, with self-report wear diaries and falls calendars being completed over this period. Blinded assessors will conduct two baseline assessments and one post-intervention assessment. Gait tasks will be completed barefoot, wearing standardised footwear only, and wearing standardised footwear with smooth and textured insoles. The primary outcome measure will be mediolateral base of support when walking over even and uneven surfaces. Secondary measures include spatiotemporal gait parameters (stride length, stride time variability, double-limb support time, velocity), gait kinematics (hip, knee, and ankle joint angles, toe clearance, trunk inclination, arm swing, mediolateral pelvis/head displacement), foot sensation (light touch-pressure, vibration, two-point discrimination) and proprioception (ankle joint position sense). Group allocation will be concealed and all analyses will be based on an intention-to-treat principle. Discussion: This study will explore the effects of wearing textured insoles over 12-weeks on gait, foot sensation and proprioception in people with multiple sclerosis. The study has the potential to identify a new, evidence-based footwear intervention which has the capacity to enhance mobility and independent living in people with multiple sclerosis.";"[Hatton, Anna L.; Brauer, Sandra G.; Williams, Katrina] Univ Queensland, Sch Hlth & Rehabil Sci, Therapies Bldg 84A, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Dixon, John] Univ Teesside, Hlth & Social Care Inst, Middlesbrough, Cleveland, England; [Rome, Keith] AUT, Hlth & Rehabil Res Inst, Auckland, New Zealand; [Rome, Keith] AUT, Sch Podiatry, Auckland, New Zealand; [Kerr, Graham] QUT, Inst Hlth & Biomed Innovat, Brisbane, Qld, Australia";Hatton, AL (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Hlth & Rehabil Sci, Therapies Bldg 84A, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.;a.hatton1@uq.edu.au;"Brauer, Sandra G/D-4519-2011; Hatton, Anna/D-2119-2011; Williams, Katrina/H-6511-2013";"Brauer, Sandra G/0000-0001-9961-4739; Hatton, Anna/0000-0002-5612-469X; Kerr, Graham/0000-0002-1008-256X; Rome, Keith/0000-0001-9818-2188; Williams, Katrina/0000-0001-5096-7752; Dixon, John/0000-0001-9298-2184";Multiple Sclerosis Research Australia;This project is funded by Multiple Sclerosis Research Australia.

For wearable devices that actively prevent falls or mitigate their consequences, a critical prerequisite is knowledge on the user's current state of balance. To keep such wearable systems practical and to achieve high acceptance, only very limited sensor instrumentation is possible, often restricted to inertial measurement units at waist level. We propose to augment this limited sensor information by combining it with additional knowledge on human gait, in the form of an observer concept. The observer contains a combination of validated concepts to model human gait: a spring-loaded inverted pendulum model with articulated upper body, where foot placement and stance leg are controlled via the extrapolated center of mass (XCoM) and the virtual pivot point (VPP), respectively. State estimation is performed via an Additive Unscented Kalman Filter (Additive UKF). We investigated sensitivity of the proposed concept to model uncertainties, and we evaluated observer performance with real data from human subjects walking on a treadmill. Data were collected from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) placed near the subject's center of mass (CoM), and observer estimates were compared to the ground truth as obtained via infrared motion capture. We found that the root mean squared deviation did not exceed 13 cm on position, 22 cm/s on velocity (0.56-1.35 m/s), 1.2 degrees on orientation, and 17 degrees/s on angular velocity.;"[Paiman, Charlotte; Lemus, Daniel; Vallery, Heike] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Mech Maritime & Mat Engn, Dept BioMech Engn, Delft, Netherlands; [Short, Debora] SENAI Innovat Inst Automat, Salvador, BA, Brazil; [Vallery, Heike] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Sensory Motor Syst Lab, Zurich, Switzerland";"Vallery, H (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Fac Mech Maritime & Mat Engn, Dept BioMech Engn, Delft, Netherlands.; Vallery, H (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Sensory Motor Syst Lab, Zurich, Switzerland.";h.vallery@tudelft.nl;Vallery, Heike/A-4254-2013;Vallery, Heike/0000-0002-0305-398X;"U.S. Department of Health and Human Services information (HHS) [90RE5010-01-01]; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services information (HHS CFDA) [93.433]; Marie-Curie career integration [PCIG13-GA-2013-618899]";This research was supported by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services information (HHS Grant Award Number: 90RE5010-01-01, HHS CFDA Number: 93.433), and by the Marie-Curie career integration grant PCIG13-GA-2013-618899.

We focused on the number of days required to reliably estimate sedentary behavior, based on time spent in sedentary behavior per day and number of sedentary breaks, number of long sedentary bouts, and average length of sedentary bouts per day. We further examined the number of days required to reliably estimate physical activity behavior, based on time spent in light and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and average length of activity bouts per day. Between 4-6 days of monitoring and 3-7 days of monitoring were necessary for good reliability of scores from all sedentary outcomes and physical activity outcomes, respectively.

The primary aim is to assess program feasibility in the four domains of process (e.g., recruitment, retention, and adherence), resources (e.g., communication, staff requirements, and monetary costs), management (e.g., time and accuracy in data collection/entry, and reporting of adverse events) and scientific outcomes (e.g., safety, burden, participant feedback and efficacy/outcomes). The trial will recruit individuals with mild-to-moderate MS-related disability across the United States who will be randomized into intervention or waitlist control conditions. All participants will complete home-based assessments (including wearing an accelerometer for 7 days and completion of a questionnaire booklet) prior to and upon completion of the 4-month program. Participants in the intervention will receive a 4-month home-based exercise program emphasizing aerobic and resistance training. Participants will be provided with exercise equipment, a DVD, a manual and a log-book. The exercise program will be supplemented with periodic newsletters in the mail highlighting principles of behavior change, and video-chats with an exercise specialist to provide motivation and social accountability. This trial serves to inform development of Phase II and III RCTs which can determine the actual efficacy and effectiveness of home-based exercise based on the MS-specific physical activity guidelines for improving symptoms and HRQOL.

Objectives: This study examined the association between rates of energy expenditure (that is, oxygen consumption (VO2)) and accelerometer counts (that is, vector magnitude (VM)) across a range of speeds during manual wheelchair propulsion on a motor-driven treadmill. Such an association allows for the generation of cutoff points for quantifying the time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) during manual wheelchair propulsion. Setting: The study was conducted in the University Laboratory. Methods: Twenty-four manual wheelchair users completed a 6-min period of seated rest and three 6-min periods of manual wheelchair propulsion on a motor-driven wheelchair treadmill. The 6-min periods of wheelchair propulsion corresponded with three treadmill speeds (1.5, 3.0 and 4.5 mph) that elicited a range of physical activity intensities. Participants wore a portable metabolic unit and accelerometers on both wrists. Primary outcome measures included steady-state VO2 and VM, and the strength of association between VO2 and VM was based on the multiple correlation and squared multiple correlation coefficients from linear regression analyses. Results: Strong linear associations were established between VO2 and VM for the left (R=0.93 +/- 0.44; R-2=0.87 +/- 0.19), right (R=0.95 +/- 0.37; R-2=0.90 +/- 0.14) and combined (R=0.94 +/- 0.38; R-2=0.88 +/- 0.15) accelerometers. The linear relationship between VO2 and VM for the left, right and combined wrists yielded cutoff points for MVPA of 3659 +/- 1302, 3630 +/- 1403 and 3644 +/- 1339 counts min(-1), respectively. Conclusion: We provide cutoff points based on the linear association between energy expenditure and accelerometer counts for estimating time spent in MVPA during manual wheelchair propulsion using wrist-worn accelerometry.

The purpose of this study was to assess the validity of a body-worn inertial sensor system (RehaGait (R)) for measuring spatiotemporal gait characteristics compared to a stationary treadmill (Zebris) and the reliability of both systems at different walking speeds and slopes. Methods: Gait analysis was performed during treadmill walking at different speeds (habitual walking speed (normal speed); 15 % above normal walking speed; 15 % below normal walking speed) and slopes (0 % slope; 15 % slope) in 22 healthy participants twice 1 week apart. Walking speed, stride length, cadence and stride time were computed from the inertial sensor system and the stationary treadmill and compared using repeated measures analysis of variance. Effect sizes of differences between systems were assessed using Cohen's d, and limits of agreement and systematic bias were computed. Results: The RehaGait (R) system slightly overestimated stride length (+2.7 %) and stride time (+0.8 %) and underestimate cadence (-1.5 %) with small effect sizes for all speeds and slopes (Cohen's d <= 0.44) except slow speed at 15 % slope (Cohen's d > 0.80). Walking speed obtained with the RehaGait (R) system closely matched the speed set on the treadmill tachometer. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were excellent for speed, cadence and stride time and for stride length at normal and fast speed at 0 % slope (ICC:.91-1.00). Good ICC values were found for stride length at slow speed at 0 % slope and all speeds at 15 % slope (ICC:.73-.90). Both devices had excellent reliability for most gait characteristics (ICC:.91-1.00) except good reliability for the RehaGait (R) for stride length at normal and fast speed at 0 % slope and at slow speed at 15 % slope (ICC:.80-.87). Conclusions: Larger limits of agreement for walking at 15 % slope suggests that uphill walking may influence the reliability of the RehaGait (R) system.

However, most studies to date have investigated the features extracted from movements of the lower limbs and do not provide a holistic gait assessment. A recent pilot study demonstrated that the holistic gait assessment such as evaluating the associations among lower and upper limbs provided better discrimination between healthy controls and PwMS. This paper is motivated by this and further aim to answer the following question: can we identify the temporal gait patterns in terms of the holistic gait assessment? Traditionally this suffers from the statistical property of the causality inference method adopted by previous study. We proposed a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn the temporal and spectral associations among the time-series motion data captured by the inertial body sensors. A simulated model was developed to train the CNN, and then the trained CNN was adopted to assess the gait performance from a pilot dataset with 41 subjects (28 PwMS and 13 healthy controls). Experimental results are reported to illustrate the performance of the proposed approach.;"[Gong, Jiaqi; Lach, John] Univ Virginia, UVA Ctr Wireless Hlth, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA; [Goldman, Myla D.] Univ Virginia, UVA Ctr Wireless Hlth, Dept Neurol, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA";Gong, JQ (corresponding author), Univ Virginia, UVA Ctr Wireless Hlth, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA.;"jgong@virginia.edu; mdg3n@virginia.edu; jlach@virginia.edu";"Goldman, Myla D/D-1955-2017; Goldman, Myla/AAG-8737-2020; Gong, Jiaqi/E-6973-2013";"Goldman, Myla/0000-0002-5675-945X; Gong, Jiaqi/0000-0001-9694-2518";;;;27;5;5;1;9;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;;;978-1-5090-3090-3;;;;2016;;;;;;;164;171;;;;;8;"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Medical Informatics; Telecommunications";"Computer Science; Engineering; Medical Informatics; Telecommunications";BG7HG;WOS:000391291200024;;;;;2021-03-18;

Here we present an adaptive filter designed to improve the quality of accelerometer data prior to measuring dynamic pelvic sway patterns during a six minute walk test in people with and without Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Optical motion capture was used as the gold standard. Improved wearable device accuracy (4.4% NRMSE) was achieved using gyroscopic corrections and scaling filter thresholds by step frequency. The people with MS presented significantly greater pelvis sway range to compensate for their lower limb weaknesses and joint contractures. The visualisation of asymmetric pelvic sway in people with MS illustrates the potential to better understand their mobility impairments for reducing fall risk.;"[Brodie, Matthew A.

Our objectives are: (1) to use IMU array data to calculate metrics that quantify performance (speed and stability) and (2) to investigate the effects of load on performance. We hypothesize that added load significantly decreases subject speed yet results in increased stability of subject movements. We propose and evaluate five performance metrics: (1) time to cross beam (less time = more speed), (2) percentage of total time spent in double support (more double support time = more stable), (3) stride duration (longer stride duration = more stable), (4) ratio of sacrum M-L to A-P acceleration (lower ratio = less lateral balance corrections = more stable), and (5) M-L torso range of motion (smaller range of motion = less balance corrections = more stable). We find that the total time to cross the beam increases with load (t = 4.85, p < 0.001). Stability metrics also change significantly with load, all indicating increased stability. In particular, double support time increases (t = 6.04, p < 0.001), stride duration increases (t = 3.436, p = 0.002), the ratio of sacrum acceleration RMS decreases (t = -5.56, p < 0.001), and the M-L torso lean range of motion decreases (t = -2.82, p = 0.009). Overall, the IMU array successfully measures subject movement and gait parameters that reveal the trade-off between speed and stability in this highly dynamic balance task. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Additionally, smartwatches are experiencing greater social acceptability, even among the elderly. While step counting is an essential parameter to calculate the user's spatial activity, current detection algorithms are insufficient for calculating steps when using a rollator, which is a common walking aid for elderly people. Through a pilot study conducted with eight different wrist-worn smart devices, an overall recognition of similar to 10% was achieved. This is because characteristic motions utilized by step counting algorithms are poorly reflected at the user's wrist when pushing a rollator. This issue is also present among other spatial activities such as pushing a pram, a bike, and a shopping cart. This paper thus introduces an improved step counting algorithm for wrist-worn accelerometers. This new algorithm was first evaluated through a controlled study and achieved promising results with an overall recognition of similar to 85%. As a follow-up, a preliminary field study with randomly selected elderly people who used rollators resulted in similar detection rates of similar to 83%. To conclude, this research will expectantly contribute to greater step counting precision in smart wearable technology.;"[Matthies, Denys J.

Accelerometric (ACC) and electromyographic (EMG) recordings were performed in 26 MS patients complaining of clumsiness, associated (n = 16) or not associated (n = 10) with visible tremor. Seventeen healthy subjects with physiological tremor (PT) and eight patients with essential tremor (ET) served as controls. Signals were analyzed using non-linear Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and related Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT), compared to the standard linear spectral analysis using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The presence of cerebellar signs and motor deficit was assessed on clinical examination. Using FFT, tremor was found in all patients with ET and 12% of subjects with PT, but in none of the MS patients, even in the presence of visible tremor. In contrast, EMD-HHT analysis of ACC-EMG coupling showed common frequency peaks characterizing tremor related to a central generator in 62.5% of MS patients with visible tremor, 40% of MS patients without visible tremor, 29% of subjects with PT, and all patients with ET. In EMD-HHT analysis, tremor characteristics were similar in subjects with PT and MS patients, regardless of the presence of a visible tremor, but these characteristics clearly differed in patients with ET. A visible tremor in MS patients was associated with more frequent cerebellar signs and less motor deficit at the upper limb. The low-frequency tremor observed in MS patients could therefore originate in lesions of the brainstem (midbrain) or cerebellothalamic circuits, or may correspond to an enhanced PT, partly favored by cerebellar dysfunction and being more visible during movement execution in the absence of concomitant motor deficit.

Methods: Thirty-eight participant pairs (MS and cohabitant) aged 18-55 years participated in the study. Each participant received an Android HTC Sensation 4G smartphone containing a custom application suite of 19 tests capturing participant performance and patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Over 1 year, participants were prompted daily to complete one assigned test. Results: A total of 22 patients with MS and 17 cohabitants completed the entire study. Among patients withMS, low scores on PROs relating tomental and visual function were associated with dropout (p < 0.05). We illustrate several novel features of a smartphone platform. First, fluctuations in MS outcomes (e.g., fatigue) were assessed against an individual's ambient environment by linking responses to meteorological data. Second, both response accuracy and speed for the Ishihara color vision test were captured, highlighting the benefits of both active and passive data collection. Third, a new trait, a person-specific learning curve in neuropsychological testing, was identified using spline analysis. Finally, averaging repeated measures over the study yielded the most robust correlation matrix of the different outcome measures.

Design: A multiple-baseline time-series design with an uncontrolled intervention. Method: Ten subjects with MS completed assessments twice before and once after a 10-week balance intervention. ANOVA were used to evaluate the effects of testing session on the Brief-BESTest, instrumented stance and gait recordings by inertial motion sensors, lower-limb strength recorded by force transducers, accelerometry-based activity, the 12-item MS Walking Scale (MSWS-12), the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 (MSQOL-54) questionnaire, the Modified Fatigue Impact scale (MFIS) and the Activity-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) scale. Results: The intervention associated with significantly improved scores on the MSQOL-54 mental component, MFIS, MSWS-12 and Brief-BESTest. Sway amplitude significantly decreased and jerk significantly increased during instrumented standing on foam with eyes closed. Instrumented gait recordings of sagittal trunk range of motion also significantly decreased. ABC scores, strength measures and activity measures were not significantly changed. Conclusions: Ten weeks of functional balance exercises provided a feasible intervention for individuals with MS that improved components of balance, mental well-being and perceived fatigue impact and ambulation disability. A future randomized, controlled clinical trial should confirm these preliminary findings.Implications for RehabilitationA balance-specific exercise program is both safe and feasible for individuals with mild-to-moderate MS.Comprehensive exercise interventions that are conceptually driven and employ well-designed progressive exercise across multiple contexts of balance control can facilitate improvements in balance impairments associated with MS.Functional balance exercises can positively impact clinical and objective measures of balance control and favorably influence perceptions of ambulation disability and fatigue as well as perceived quality of life in people with MS.;"[Kasser, Susan L.; Jacobs, Jesse V.; Ford, Marley] Univ Vermont, Dept Rehabil & Movement Sci, 306 Rowell Bldg,106 Carrigan Dr, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Tourville, Timothy W.] Univ Vermont, Dept Orthopaed & Rehabil, Burlington, VT 05405 USA";Kasser, SL (corresponding author), Univ Vermont, Dept Rehabil & Movement Sci, 306 Rowell Bldg,106 Carrigan Dr, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.;Susan.Kasser@uvm.edu;;;;;;64;17;17;0;22;TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0963-8288;1464-5165;;DISABIL REHABIL;Disabil.

There are several studies about factors affecting physical activity in pwMS. However, these factors have not investigated in minimally impaired pwMS who do not have remarkable symptoms and walking disturbance. The objective was to determine factors affecting physical activity in minimally impaired pwMS. Patients and Methods: We recruited 52 minimally impaired pwMS and measured physical activity with Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ) and an accelerometer used for the 7-day period. Demographic data were recorded. Walking (speed, endurance, dexterity, and quality), fatigue, depression, and quality of life were measured. Methods: We recruited 52 minimally impaired pwMS and measured physical activity with Godin LeisureTime Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ) and an accelerometer used for the 7-day period. Demographic data were recorded. Walking (speed, endurance, dexterity, and quality), fatigue, depression, and quality of life were measured. Results: The walking speed assessed by the Timed 25-Foot Walk and gender were found the determinants of physical activity level assessed by the GLTEQ and accelerometer, respectively. Walking (speed, endurance, and dexterity), gender, employment status, and quality of life were associated with physical activity. Either female or unemployed participants had significantly less physical activity. There were no significant difference between physical activity levels and the other subgroups. Conclusion: Either to be a female or to have slower walking speed was associated with less physical activity. Strategies to improve walking should be focused on female pwMS with minimal impairment.

Design: Randomized controlled trial, 3-month postintervention follow-up. Setting: Home and general community, and university research laboratory. Participants: Nonambulatory individuals with MS (N=14; mean age +/- SD, 53.6 +/- 8.7y) were randomly assigned to an intervention group (IG) or a control group (CG). Interventions: After baseline testing, the IG participants received custom-fit, ultralightweight manual wheelchairs with propulsion/skills training, followed by 3 months of at-home use with the custom ultralightweight wheelchair and weekly phone calls to deliver support through a multifactorial intervention. The CG participants received no training and used their own wheelchairs at home during this time. Main Outcome Measures: All subjects were assessed at baseline and 3 months later for fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale), upper extremity strength (digital handheld dynamometer), and propulsion technique (on a treadmill [0.5m/s] with instrumented wheels). Two 1-week bouts of physical activity were measured in both groups from home with wrist-worn accelerometry at the beginning (IG and CG in own wheelchairs) and end (IG in study wheelchair, CG in own) of the 3-month period of home use. Results: The intervention was well tolerated, and no adverse events were reported. The IG demonstrated increased strength (P=.008) and a trend toward less fatigue (P=.068), both with large effect sizes (d>0.8), as well as reduced application of braking torque during propulsion (P=.003) with a moderate/large effect size (d=.73), compared with the CG. Conclusions: Findings suggest a 3-month physical activity intervention based on manual wheelchair propulsion and training is safe and feasible for some wheelchair users living with MS and may produce secondary benefits in strength, fatigue, and propulsion technique.

Objectives: To determine the prevalence and severity of fatigue in persons with subacute spinal cord injury (SCI), assess whether demographic and lesion characteristics are related to fatigue and determine the relationship with physical fitness and physical behavior. Setting: Measurements were performed 2 months before discharge from inpatient rehabilitation. Methods: Thirty-six persons with subacute SCI, dependent on a manual wheelchair, mean age 43 +/- 15 and 83% men, completed the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). FSS scores 44 indicated fatigue. We recorded age and lesion characteristics, measured body mass index, measured peak power output and peak oxygen uptake during a maximal handcycling test and determined physical behavior using an accelerometer-based activity monitor. T-tests were used to test for differences in fatigue between subgroups based on age and lesion characteristics, and regression analyses to assess the relationship with physical fitness and physical behavior. Results: Mean FSS was 3.3 +/- 1.3. Fatigue, including severe fatigue, was prevalent in 31% (95% confidence interval: 16-46) of participants compared with 18% in the general population. Furthermore, mean fatigue was significantly higher in persons with incomplete compared with complete lesions (t=2.22, P=0.03). Mean scores between other subgroups did not differ significantly. Of the physical fitness and physical behavior measures, only peak oxygen uptake tended to be related to more fatigue (B=-1.47, P=0.05). Conclusion: Fatigue was prevalent and is of concern in persons with subacute SCI. Those with incomplete lesions seem to be at higher risk. Because fatigue is known to persist among persons with SCI, interventions to reduce fatigue seem necessary.;"[Nooijen, C. F. J.; Stam, H. J.; van den Berg-Emons, H. J.

Ankle mechanical impedance plays a pivotal role at the interface between the neuro-mechanical system and the physical world. This paper reports, for the first time, a characterization of human ankle mechanical impedance in two degrees-of-freedom simultaneously as it varies with time during walking. Ensemble-based linear time-varying system identification methods implemented with a wearable ankle robot, Anklebot, enabled reliable estimation of ankle mechanical impedance from the pre-swing phase through the entire swing phase to the early-stance phase. This included heel-strike and toe-off, key events in the transition from the swing to stance phase or vice versa. Time-varying ankle mechanical impedance was accurately approximated by a second order model consisting of inertia, viscosity, and stiffness in both inversion-eversion and dorsiflexion-plantarflexion directions, as observed in our previous steady-state dynamic studies. We found that viscosity and stiffness of the ankle significantly decreased at the end of the stance phase before toe-off, remained relatively constant across the swing phase, and increased around heel-strike. Closer investigation around heel-strike revealed that viscosity and stiffness in both planes increased before heel-strike occurred. This finding is important evidence of pretuning by the central nervous system. In addition, viscosity and stiffness were greater in the sagittal plane than in the frontal plane across all subgait phases, except the early stance phase.

This paper describes a method to extract upper limb intention tremor from gyroscope data, through the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT), a technique suitable for the study of nonlinear and non-stationary processes. The aims of the study were to: (i) evaluate the method's ability to discriminate between healthy controls and MS subjects; (ii) validate the proposed procedure against clinical tremor scores assigned using Fahn's tremor rating scale (FTRS); and (iii) compare the performance of the HHT-based method with that of linear band-pass filters. Approach. HHT was applied on gyroscope data collected on 20 MS subjects and 13 healthy controls (CO) during finger-to-nose tests (FNTs) instrumented with an inertial sensor placed on the hand. The results were compared to those obtained after traditional linear filtering. The tremor amplitude was quantified with instrumental indexes (TIs) and clinical FTRS ratings. Main results. The TIs computed after HHT-based filtering discriminated between CO and MS subjects with clinically-detected intention tremor (MS_T). In particular, TIs were significantly higher in the final part of the movement (TI2) with respect to the first part (TI1), and, for all components (X, Y, Z), MS_T showed a TI2 significantly higher than in CO subjects. Moreover, the HHT detected subtle alterations not visible from clinical ratings, as TI2 (Z-component) was significantly increased in MS subjects without clinically-detected tremor (MS_NT). The method's validity was demonstrated by significant correlations between clinical FTRS scores and TI2 related to X (rs = 0.587, p = 0.006) and Y (rs = 0.682, p < 0.001) components. Contrarily, fewer differences among the groups and no correlation between instrumental and clinical indexes emerged after traditional filtering. Significance. The present results supported the use of the HHT-based procedure for a fully-automated quantitative and objective measure of intention tremor in MS, which can overcome the limitations of clinical scales and provide supplementary information about this sign.";"[Carpinella, Ilaria; Ferrarin, Maurizio] Don Carlo Gnocchi Fdn Onlus IRCCS, Biomed Technol Dept, I-20148 Milan, Italy; [Cattaneo, Davide] Don Carlo Gnocchi Fdn Onlus IRCCS, Dept Neurorehabil, LaRiCE Gait & Balance Disorders Lab, I-20148 Milan, Italy";Carpinella, I (corresponding author), Don Carlo Gnocchi Fdn Onlus IRCCS, Biomed Technol Dept, I-20148 Milan, Italy.;"icarpinella@dongnocchi.it; dcattaneo@dongnocchi.it; mferrarin@dongnocchi.it";"Ferrarin, Maurizio/I-3230-2012; Carpinella, Ilaria/K-1572-2016";"Ferrarin, Maurizio/0000-0002-7797-2399; Cattaneo, Davide/0000-0003-4251-1856; Carpinella, Ilaria/0000-0001-7486-0706";Italian Ministry of HealthMinistry of Health, Italy [GR-2009-1604984];This work was supported by funding from Italian Ministry of Health (Ricerca Corrente and Ricerca Finalizzata GR-2009-1604984).;;51;5;5;0;9;IOP PUBLISHING LTD;BRISTOL;TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND;1741-2560;1741-2552;;J NEURAL ENG;J.

MethodSixty-five young people aged 8 to 17years (35 males, 30 females; mean age 13y 2mo, SD 2y 8mo) with mild to moderate physical disabilities (Gillette Functional Assessment Questionnaire levels 7-10) were recruited. Self-reported fatigue was measured using the PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale. Physical activity was measured using 7-day hip-worn accelerometer. Associations between fatigue, physical activity, and socio-demographic characteristics were examined using analysis of covariance, with significance () set at 0.05. Results were compared with normative data from other paediatric populations. ResultsAmong children with physical disabilities, fatigue was associated with being physically inactive (F-statistic=4.42, p=0.040), female (F=4.37, p=0.042), and of low socio-economic status (F=3.94, p=0.050). Fatigue was not associated with age, weight status, or functional impairment. Young people with physical disabilities experienced high levels of fatigue compared with other paediatric health populations, and comparable to the paediatric cancer population. InterpretationFatigue is an important issue for young people with physical disabilities. Clinicians and researchers working with this group should be mindful that fatigue is likely to impact on an individual's ability to undertake new treatment regimens or interventions. Interventions aimed at reducing fatigue are warranted. Increasing physical activity might play a role in reducing fatigue.";"[Maher, Carol; Watson, Amanda; Dollman, James] Univ S Australia, Sansom Inst, ARENA, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia; [Crettenden, Angela; Evans, Kerry; Toohey, Monica] Novita Childrens Serv, Regency Pk, PA USA; [Thiessen, Myra] Univ S Australia, Sch Art Architecture & Design, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia";Maher, C (corresponding author), Univ S Australia, Sansom Inst, ARENA, GPO Box 2471, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia.;carol.maher@unisa.edu.au;"Watson, Amanda/Y-6674-2019; Maher, Carol/C-8169-2009; Thiessen, Myra/F-4559-2013; Dollman, James/A-5277-2010";"Watson, Amanda/0000-0002-9058-3435; Maher, Carol/0000-0002-8676-0224; Thiessen, Myra/0000-0003-2887-2129; Dollman, James/0000-0002-6427-2115";"South Australian Channel 7 Children's Research Fund; Australian Postdoctoral Research Fellowship from Australian National Heart Foundation; South Australian Cardiovascular Research Development Program (SACVRDP) Fellowship from National Heart Foundation";This study was undertaken with a research grant provided by the South Australian Channel 7 Children's Research Fund.

A sustained increase of cytoplasmic free [Ca2+] is a common upstream event of many neuronal and axonal damage processes and could represent an early and potentially reversible step. New method: We propose a method to specifically analyze the neurodegenerative aspects of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) imaging of neuronal and axonal Ca2+ dynamics by two-photon laser scanning microscopy (TPLSM). Results: Using the genetically encoded Ca2+ sensor TN-XXL expressed in neurons and their corresponding axons, we confirm the increase of cytoplasmic free [Ca2+] in axons and neurons of autoimmune inflammatory lesions compared to those in non-inflamed brains. We show that these relative [Ca2+] increases were associated with immune-neuronal interactions. Comparison with existing methods: In contrast to Ca2+-sensitive dyes the use of a genetically encoded Ca2+ sensor allows reliable intraaxonal free [Ca2+] measurements in living anesthetized mice in health and disease. This method detects early axonal damage processes in contrast to e.g. cell/axon morphology analysis, that rather detects late signs of neurodegeneration. Conclusions: Thus, we describe a method to analyze and monitor early neuronal damage processes in the brain in vivo. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

To determine, (1) the agreement between the standard measurements of MS-related disability [expanded disability status scale (EDSS), functional systems (FS) and ambulation index (AI)] obtained by conventional and remote evaluation using a multimedia platform; (2) the usefulness of monitoring 6-min walk test (6MWT) and average daily walking activity (aDWA) to better characterize patients disability. Twenty-five patients (EDSS score 1.0-6.5) were evaluated every 3 months for the first year, and aDWA repeated at year 2. Remote visits included the recording of a video with self-performed neurological examination and specific multimedia questionnaires. aDWA was measured by a triaxial accelerometer. All but two patients completed the study. Modest agreement between conventional and multimedia EDSS was found for EDSS <= 4.0 (kappa = 0.2) and good for EDSS >= 4.5 (kappa = 0.6). For the overall sample, pyramidal, cerebellar and brainstem FS showed the greatest agreement (kappa = 0.7). SR-AI showed a modest agreement for EDSS <= 4.0 and good for EDSS >= 4.5 (kappa = 0.3 and 0.6, respectively). There was a strong correlation between conventional and 6MWT measured by accelerometer (r = 0.76). The aDWA correlated strongly with the EDSS (r = -0.86) and a cut-off point of 3279.3 steps/day discriminated patients with ambulatory impairment. There was a significant decline in aDWA over 2 years in patients with ambulatory impairment that were not observed by standard measurements of disability. MS clinical monitoring by telemedicine is feasible, but the observed lower agreement in less disabled patients emphasizes the need to optimize the assessment methodology.

DesignCross-sectional. SettingPopulation based. ParticipantsCommunity-dwelling older adults (60) living in the United States who were participants in the 2003 to 2004 or 2005 to 2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Participants were classified as with or without mobility disability according to responses to self-reported questions about ability to walk, climb stairs, and/or use of ambulatory aids. MeasurementsAccelerometer-derived sedentary and activity variables for volume (time in sedentary (<100 counts per minute (cpm)), very light- (100-759cpm), light- (760-1,951cpm), and moderate- to vigorous- (1,952cpm) intensity activity and pattern (number of breaks from sedentary time, duration of sedentary bouts, duration of activity bouts). Survey-weighted regression models, adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, education, and smoking, were used to examine the associations between pattern of activity and cardiometabolic health risk factors (blood pressure, waist circumference, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol). ResultsOf the 2,017 participants, 547 were classified as having a mobility disability. Participants with mobility disability had more sedentary time and less active time than those without. Sedentary bouts were longer and active bouts shorter in those with disability. The total number of sedentary breaks (transitions from sedentary to nonsedentary) differed between groups after adjustment for total sedentary time. Fewer breaks, longer sedentary bouts, and shorter activity bouts were associated with higher average waist circumference regardless of disability status.

This enzyme is a peripheral biomarker of neuroinflammation in multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic autoimmune disease of the central nervous system. Presently, expensive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies are used to monitor subclinical disease activity in MS. An alternative to costly MRI scans could be the detection of MMP-9, using a low-cost, disposable sensor system for MMP-9 suitable for home-monitoring of inflammation. This would allow an early prediction of the failure of anti-inflammatory therapies and more timely clinical intervention to limit neuronal damage and prevent disability. Herein we present the development of a disposable sensor for fast and straightforward detection of MMP-9. Biosensors were produced by coating electrodes with oxidized dextran and subsequent crosslinking with peptides containing specific cleavage sites for MMP-9. Exposure of the films to the enzyme resulted in the degradation of the films, which was monitored using impedance measurements. Sensor response was rapid, a significant impedance change was usually observed within 5 min after the addition of MMP-9. Sensors showed a negligible response to matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), a protease which may interfere with MMP-9 detection. The peptide sequence with the highest sensitivity and selectivity Leu-Gly-Arg-Met-Gly-Leu-Pro-Gly-Lys was selected to construct calibration curves. MMP-9 was successfully detected in a clinically relevant range from 50 to 400 ng/ml. Two different processes of hydrogel degradation were observed on electrode surfaces with different roughness, and both appeared suitable to monitor MMP-9 activity. The sensor materials are generic and can be easily adopted to respond to other proteases by selecting peptide cross-linkers with suitable cleavage sites. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Substantial cost, space, time to administer, and need for trained personnel limit widespread use of biomechanical techniques in the assessment of postural stability in clinical or field environments. Objective: To determine whether accelerometer and gyroscope data sampled from a consumer electronics device (iPad2) provide sufficient resolution of center-of-gravity (COG) movements to accurately quantify postural stability in healthy young people. Design: Controlled laboratory study. Setting: Research laboratory in an academic medical center. Patients or Other Participants: A total of 49 healthy individuals (age = 19.5 +/- 3.1 years, height = 167.7 +/- 13.2 cm, mass = 68.5 +/- 17.5 kg). Intervention(s): Participants completed the NeuroCom Sensory Organization Test (SOT) with an iPad2 affixed at the sacral level. Main Outcome Measure(s): Primary outcomes were equilibrium scores from both systems and the time series of the angular displacement of the anteroposterior COG sway during each trial. A Bland-Altman assessment for agreement was used to compare equilibrium scores produced by the NeuroCom and iPad2 devices. Limits of agreement was defined as the mean bias (NeuroCom - iPad) +/- 2 standard deviations. Mean absolute percentage error and median difference between the NeuroCom and iPad2 measurements were used to evaluate how closely the real-time COG sway measured by the 2 systems tracked each other. Results: The limits between the 2 devices ranged from -0.5 degrees to 0.5 degrees in SOT condition 1 to -2.9 degrees to 1.3 degrees in SOT condition 5. The largest absolute value of the measurement error within the 95% confidence intervals for all conditions was 2.9 degrees. The mean absolute percentage error analysis indicated that the iPad2 tracked NeuroCom COG with an average error ranging from 5.87% to 10.42% of the NeuroCom measurement across SOT conditions. Conclusions: The iPad2 hardware provided data of sufficient precision and accuracy to quantify postural stability. Accuracy, portability, and affordability make using the iPad2 a reasonable approach for assessing postural stability in clinical and field environments.;"[Alberts, Jay L.; Hirsch, Joshua R.; Koop, Mandy Miller; Schindler, David D.; Kana, Daniel E.; Linder, Susan M.; Campbell, Scott; Thota, Anil K.] Cleveland Clin, Dept Biomed Engn, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA; [Alberts, Jay L.; Thota, Anil K.] Cleveland Clin, Ctr Neurol Restorat, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA; [Alberts, Jay L.; Hirsch, Joshua R.; Schindler, David D.; Linder, Susan M.; Campbell, Scott] Cleveland Clin, Concuss Ctr, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA; [Alberts, Jay L.] L Stokes Cleveland VA Med Ctr, Cleveland Funct Elect Stimulat Ctr, Cleveland, OH USA";Alberts, JL (corresponding author), Cleveland Clin, Concuss Ctr, 9500 Euclid Ave, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA.;albertj@ccf.org;Thota, Anil/J-3305-2019;Thota, Anil/0000-0003-0605-2269;"Lincy Foundation; Edward F. and Barbara S.

Even though there are several tools available to quantify ambulatory behavior in a home environment, reliable measurement of joint motion is still limited to laboratory tests. The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a novel inertial sensor system for ambulatory behavior and joint motion measurement in the everyday environment. An algorithm for behavior classification, step detection, and knee angle calculation was developed. The validation protocol consisted of simulated daily activities in a laboratory environment. The tests were performed with ten healthy subjects and eleven patients with multiple sclerosis. Activity classification showed comparable performance to commercially available activPAL sensors. Step detection with our sensor system was more accurate. The calculated flexion-extension angle of the knee joint showed a root mean square error of less than 5 degrees compared with results obtained using an electro-mechanical goniometer. This new system combines ambulatory behavior assessment and knee angle measurement for long-term measurement periods in a home environment.

Within this field, researchers in need of developing FES-based control solutions for specific disabilities often have to choose between either the acquisition and integration of high-performance industry-level systems, which are rather expensive and hardly portable, or develop custom-made portable solutions, which despite their lower cost, usually require expert-level electronic skills. Here, a flexible low-cost microcontroller-based platform for rapid prototyping of FES neuroprostheses is presented, designed for reduced execution complexity, development time, and production cost. For this reason, the Arduino open-source microcontroller platform was used, together with off-the-shelf components whenever possible. The developed system enables the rapid deployment of portable FES-based gait neuroprostheses, being flexible enough to allow simple open-loop strategies but also more complex closed-loop solutions. The system is based on a modular architecture that allows the development of optimized solutions depending on the desired FES applications, even though the design and testing of the platform were focused toward drop foot correction. The flexibility of the system was demonstrated using two algorithms targeting drop foot condition within different experimental setups. Successful bench testing of the device in healthy subjects demonstrated these neuroprosthesis platform capabilities to correct drop foot.;"[de Melo, Paulo Luzio; da Silva, Miguel Tavares; Martins, Jorge] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, Mech Engn, IDMEC, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal; [de Melo, Paulo Luzio; Newman, Dava] MIT, Man Vehicle Lab, Aeroastro Dept, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA";de Melo, P (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, Mech Engn, Ave Rovisco Pais 1,Ed Mecan 2,Sala 1-02 Lisboa, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal.;paulo.de.melo@tecnico.ulisboa.pt;"Silva, Miguel/K-2782-2012; Martins, Jorge/J-5018-2012";"Silva, Miguel/0000-0001-7056-4555; Martins, Jorge/0000-0003-3789-6384";"Associacao Salvador; MIT Portugal Program; Fundacao para a Ciencia e TecnologiaPortuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission [MIT-Pt/BS-HHMS/0042/2008, SFRH/BD/42966/2008]";The authors would like to acknowledge Associacao Salvador for their support and also acknowledge the support given by MIT Portugal Program and Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia through the DACHOR project-Multibody Dynamics and Control of Hybrid Active Orthoses (MIT-Pt/BS-HHMS/0042/2008)-and the research grant SFRH/BD/42966/2008.;;0;7;7;0;22;WILEY-BLACKWELL;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0160-564X;1525-1594;;ARTIF ORGANS;Artif.

Short clinical gait tests up to ten meters and 2- or 6-Minutes Walking Tests (2MWT/6MWT) are used as performance-based outcomes in Multiple Sclerosis ( MS) studies and considered as moderately associated with real life mobility. Objective To investigate the ecological validity of 10 Meter Walking Test (10mWT), 2MWT and 6MWT. Methods Persons with MS performed 10mWT, 6MWT including 2MWT and 7 recorded days by accelerometry. Ecological validity was assumed if walking tests represented a typical walking sequence in real-life and correlations with accelerometry parameters were strong. Results In this cohort (n=28, medians: age=45, EDSS=3.2, disease duration=9 years), uninterrupted walking of 2 or 6 minutes occurred not frequent in real life (2.61 and 0.35 sequences/day). 10mWT correlated only with slow walking speed quantiles in real life. 2MWT and 6MWT correlated moderately with most real life walking parameters. Conclusion Clinical gait tests over a few meters have a poor ecological validity while validity is moderate for 2MWT and 6MWT. Mobile accelerometry offers the opportunity to control and improve the ecological validity of MS mobility outcomes.;"[Stellmann, J.

The expansion of activity tracking and personal data collection offers the potential for patient engagement in the management of chronic diseases. Consumer wearable devices for activity tracking have shown promise in post-surgery recovery in cardiac patients, pulmonary rehabilitation, and activity counseling in diabetic patients, among others. Unfortunately, the data generated by wearable devices is seldom integrated into programmatic self-management chronic disease regimens. In addition, there is lack of evidence supporting sustained use or effects on health outcomes, as studies have primarily focused on establishing the feasibility of monitoring activity and the association of measured activity with short-term benefits. Discussion: Monitoring devices can make a direct and real-time impact on self-management, but the validity and reliability of measurements need to be established. In order for patients to become engaged in wearable data gathering, key patient-centered issues relating to usefulness in care, motivation, the safety and privacy of information, and clinical integration need to be addressed. Because the successful usage of wearables requires an ability to comprehend and utilize personal health data, the user experience should account for individual differences in numeracy skills and apply evidence-based behavioral science principles to promote continued engagement. Summary: Activity monitoring has the potential to engage patients as advocates in their personalized care, as well as offer health care providers real world assessments of their patients' daily activity patterns. This potential will be realized as the voice of the chronic disease patients is accounted for in the design of devices, measurements are validated against existing clinical assessments, devices become part of the treatment 'prescription', behavior change programs are used to engage patients in self-management, and best practices for clinical integration are defined.;"[Chiauzzi, Emil; Rodarte, Carlos; DasMahapatra, Pronabesh] PatientsLikeMe Inc, Cambridge, MA 02141 USA";Chiauzzi, E (corresponding author), PatientsLikeMe Inc, 155 Second St, Cambridge, MA 02141 USA.;echiauzzi@patientslikeme.com;;;"AbbvieAbbott Laboratories; Accorda; Actelion; AmgenAmgen; AstraZenecaAstraZeneca; Avanir; BiogenBiogen; Boehringer IngelheimBoehringer Ingelheim; GenentechRoche HoldingGenentech; GenzymeGenzyme Corporation; JanssenJohnson & Johnson USAJanssen Biotech Inc; Johnson JohnsonJohnson & Johnson USA; MerckMerck & Company; NovartisNovartis; SanofiSanofi-Aventis; UCBUCB Pharma SA";EC, CR, and PD are employees of PatientsLikeMe and hold stock options in the company.

It has uses not only as a research tool but in clinical settings as well, for example in monitoring cell-based regenerative therapies, in which cells are transplanted to replace degenerating or damaged tissues, or to restore a physiological function. The success of such cell-based therapies depends on several critical issues, including the route and accuracy of cell transplantation, the fate of cells after transplantation, and the interaction of engrafted cells with the host microenvironment. To assess these issues, it is necessary to monitor transplanted cells non-invasively in real-time. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a tool uniquely suited to this task, given its ability to image deep inside tissue with high temporal resolution and sensitivity. Extraordinary efforts have recently been made to improve cellular MRI as applied to regenerative medicine, by developing more advanced contrast agents for use as probes and sensors. These advances enable the non-invasive monitoring of cell fate and, more recently, that of the different cellular functions of living cells, such as their enzymatic activity and gene expression, as well as their time point of cell death. We present here a review of recent advancements in the development of these probes and sensors, and of their functioning, applications and limitations.;"[Srivastava, Amit K.; Kadayakkara, Deepak K.; Bar-Shir, Amnon; Gilad, Assaf A.; McMahon, Michael T.; Bulte, Jeff W.

This cross-sectional study examined the nature of associations among physical activity, aerobic capacity, and walking performance in persons with MS and healthy controls. Methods: The sample included 31 persons with MS and 31 controls matched by age, sex, height, and weight. Participants completed the 6-minute walk (6MW), wore an ActiGraph model GT3X accelerometer for 7 days as an objective measure of physical activity (expressed as time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity [MVPA]), and completed an incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer as a measure of aerobic capacity (VO2peak). Results: Hierarchical linear regression analyses indicated that MVPA and VO2peak partially explained group differences in 6MW performance (R-2 = 0.782), although group remained a significant predictor of 6MW performance (beta = 0.304; P < 0.001). Path analysis indicated that group had both statistically significant direct and indirect effects on 6MW performance, and the indirect effect operated through pathways involving MVPA and VO2peak. Discussion and Conclusions: These results provide direct preliminary evidence that physiological deconditioning, perhaps occurring as a result of physical inactivity, may explain variability in walking impairment in persons with MS. These findings support the design and implementation of targeted interventions for improving walking impairment in this population.

Recent advances in inexpensive, wireless sensor technology and smart devices are resulting in an explosion of miniature, portable sensors that can quickly and accurately quantify body motion. Practical and useful movement monitoring systems are now becoming available. It is critical that therapists understand the potential advantages and limitations of such emerging technology. One important advantage of obtaining objective measures of balance and gait from body-worn sensors is impairment-level metrics characterizing how and why functional performance of balance and gait activities are impaired. Therapy can then be focused on the specific physiological reasons for difficulty in walking or balancing during specific tasks. A second advantage of using technology to measure balance and gait behavior is the increased sensitivity of the balance and gait measures to document mild disability and change with rehabilitation. A third advantage of measuring movement, such as postural sway and gait characteristics, with body-worn sensors is the opportunity for immediate biofeedback provided to patients that can focus attention and enhance performance. In the future, body-worn sensors may allow therapists to perform telerehabilitation to monitor compliance with home exercise programs and the quality of their natural mobility in the community. Therapists need technological systems that are quick to use and provide actionable information and useful reports for their patients and referring physicians. Therapists should look for systems that provide measures that have been validated with respect to gold standard accuracy and to clinically relevant outcomes such as fall risk and severity of disability.;"[Horak, Fay] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Neurol, Balance Disorders Lab, Portland, OR 97239 USA; [Horak, Fay] Portland VA Hlth Care Syst VAPORHCS, Portland, OR USA; [Horak, Fay] APDM Inc, Portland, OR USA; [King, Laurie; Mancini, Martina] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Neurol, Sch Med, Portland, OR 97239 USA";Horak, F (corresponding author), Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Neurol, Balance Disorders Lab, 3181 Sam Jackson Pk Rd,SJH 2244, Portland, OR 97239 USA.;horakf@ohsu.edu;;Mancini, Martina/0000-0002-4532-3984;"NIH NIA Merit [AG006457]; VA MeritUS Department of Veterans Affairs [I01 RX001075-01]; NIH NINDS SBIRUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS) [IR43AG044863]; NIH STTRUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [IR4IHD071760-03]; NMSS Mentor Fellowship [MB0011]; EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH & HUMAN DEVELOPMENTUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [K99HD078492, R42HD071760, R41HD071760, R41HD071760, R42HD071760, R42HD071760, K99HD078492] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGINGUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA) [R01AG006457, R01AG006457, R37AG006457, R01AG006457, R37AG006457, R37AG006457, R01AG006457, R37AG006457, R01AG006457, R01AG006457, R01AG006457, R01AG006457, R01AG006457, R37AG006457, R01AG006457, R37AG006457, R01AG006457, R01AG006457, R01AG006457, R37AG006457, R01AG006457, R37AG006457, R01AG006457, R01AG006457, R37AG006457, R01AG006457, R37AG006457, R37AG006457, R37AG006457, R01AG006457, R37AG006457, R01AG006457, R37AG006457, R01AG006457, R37AG006457, R37AG006457, R37AG006457, R01AG006457, R01AG006457, R01AG006457, R37AG006457, R01AG006457, R43AG044863, R01AG006457, R01AG006457, R43AG044863] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; Veterans AffairsUS Department of Veterans Affairs [I01RX001075, I01RX001075, I01RX001075, I01RX001075] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER";This work was funded by the following grants: NIH NIA Merit AG006457, VA Merit I01 RX001075-01, NIH NINDS SBIR IR43AG044863, NIH STTR IR4IHD071760-03, and NMSS Mentor Fellowship MB0011.;;67;89;90;2;49;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA;0031-9023;1538-6724;;PHYS THER;Phys.

The parameters that are recorded by our system correspond to neurological deficits that are typical for multiple sclerosis (MS) like symptoms in animals. Normally, quantification of motor impairment requires neurological examination and complex behavioral testing. However, to perform these tests is an error-prone and time consuming process. Therefore, a strong interest exists in the automation and objective analysis of motoric behavior. Our presented small, accurate, and lightweight motion sensors provides an optimal solution for this problem. The developed motion sensors have the smallest volume and weight requirements available at the moment to monitor motoric dysfunction of animals. The collected data from the sensor is more representative since the subjective human factor is minimized and the animal can stay in its usual environment rather than being placed in a separate observation cage. We present two wireless motion sensors. An active sensor is powered with battery and saving the data on a SD-Card. The second sensor works completely passive and is powered via electromagnetic field. The sensors provide full control over the data of a three-axis accelerometer, a three-axis gyroscope, and a three-axis magnetometer.

Now with the appearance of the commercial EEG headsets and mobile smart platforms (tablet, smartphone), it is possible to develop the mobile BCI system, which can greatly improve the life quality of patients suffering from motor disease, such as amyotrophic lateral scleroses (ALS), multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy and head trauma. This study adopted a 14-channel Emotiv EPOC headset and Microsoft surface pro 3 to realize a dialing system, which was represented by 4x3 matrices of alphanumeric characters. The performance of the online portable dialing system based on P300 is satisfying. The average classification accuracy reaches 88.75 +/- 10.57% in lab and 73.75 +/- 16.94% in metro, while the information transfer rate (ITR) reaches 7.17 +/- 1.80 and 5.05 +/- 2.17 bits/min respectively.

On these bases, we aimed at probing the efficacy of a mental visual imagery (MVI)-based facilitation programme on AM and EFT functioning in the context of a randomised-controlled trial study in RR-MS patients. Methods: Using the Autobiographical Interview (AI), 40 patients presenting with an AM/EFT impairment were randomly assigned in three groups: (i) the experimental (n = 17), who followed the MVI programme, (ii) the verbal control (n = 10), who followed a sham verbal programme, and (iii) the stability groups (n = 13), who underwent the AM/EFT test twice, with no intervention in between. Results: AI's second assessment scores showed a significant improvement of AM and EFT performance only for the experimental group, with a long-term robustness of treatment benefits. Conclusions: The control and stability groups' results ruled out nursing and test learning effects as explanations of AM/EFT improvement. These benefits were corroborated by the patients' comments, which indicated an effective MVI strategy transfer to daily life. Our results suggest that the MVI programme tackles a common cognitive process of scene construction present in AM and EFT.;"[Ernst, Alexandra; Manning, Liliann] Univ Strasbourg, Cognit Neuropsychol & Physiopathol Schizophrenia, INSERM, UMR 1114, F-67000 Strasbourg, France; [Blanc, Frederic; De Seze, Jerome] Univ Hosp Strasbourg, Dept Neurol, Strasbourg, France; [Blanc, Frederic; De Seze, Jerome] Univ Hosp Strasbourg, CMRR, Strasbourg, France; [Blanc, Frederic] Univ Strasbourg, ICube, CNRS, UMR 7357, F-67000 Strasbourg, France; [Blanc, Frederic] FMTS, Strasbourg, France; [De Seze, Jerome] Univ Hosp Strasbourg, CIC, INSERM 1434, Strasbourg, France";Manning, L (corresponding author), Univ Strasbourg, Dept Psychol, 12 Rue Goethe, F-67000 Strasbourg, France.;manning@unistra.fr;"De Seze, Jerome/M-8316-2016; Blanc, Frederic/AAE-7975-2019; Ernst, Alexandra/AAE-7337-2019";"De Seze, Jerome/0000-0002-7197-7578; Blanc, Frederic/0000-0002-6714-3247; Manning, Liliann/0000-0001-5027-8551";"'Fondation pour la Recherche sur la Sclerose en Plaques' (ARSEP; Ile de France); Ministry of National Education and Research; Region Bourgogne (France)Region Bourgogne-Franche-Comte";"We are grateful to the patients and their families for their support and involvement in our research.

Little is known about physical activity and its association with volumes of whole brain gray matter and white matter and deep gray matter structures in persons with multiple sclerosis (MS). Purpose. This study examined the association between levels of physical activity and brain volumetric measures from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in MS. Method. 39 persons with MS wore an accelerometer for a 7-day period and underwent a brain MRI. Normalized GM volume (NGMV), normalized WM volume (NWMV), and deep GM structures were calculated from 3D T1-weighted structural brain images. We conducted partial correlations (pr) controlling for demographic and clinical variables. Results. Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was significantly associated with NGMV (pr = 0.370, p < 0.05), NWMV (pr = 0.433, p < 0.01), hippocampus (pr = 0.499, p < 0.01), thalamus (pr = 0.380, p < 0.05), caudate (pr = 0.539, p < 0.01), putamen (pr = 0.369, p < 0.05), and pallidum (pr = 0.498, p < 0.01) volumes, when controlling for sex, age, clinical course of MS, and Expanded Disability Status Scale score. There were no associations between sedentary and light physical activity with MRI outcomes. Conclusion.

Design: Case-control explorative study. Setting: Outpatient rehabilitation department and participants' daily environment. Participants: Fatigued persons with MS (n = 23) were selected from a randomized controlled trial. Cases were matched by age and sex to healthy, nonfatigued controls (n = 23). Eligible persons with MS were severely fatigued (Checklist Individual Strength fatigue domain mean score, 43.2 +/- 6.6) and ambulatory (Expanded Disability Status Scale mean score, 2.5 +/- 1.5). Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Measurements were performed using an accelerometer over 7 days. Outcomes included the following: amount of physical activity expressed in counts per day, counts per minute (CPM), and counts per day period (morning, afternoon, evening); duration of activity intensity categories (sedentary, light physical activity, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity [MVPA]); and distribution of MVPA and sedentary periods over the day. Results: Persons with MS had fewer counts per day (mean difference, -156 x 10(3); 95% confidence interval [CI], -273 x 10(3) to -39 x 103; P = .010), had fewer CPM (mean difference, -135; 95% CI, -256 to -14; P = .030), and were less physically active in the morning (mean difference, -200; 95% CI, -389 to -11; P = .039) and evening (mean difference, -175; 95% CI, -336 to -14; P = .034) than controls. Persons with MS spent a higher percentage of their time sedentary (mean difference, 5.6; 95% CI,.1-11.1; P = .045) and spent less time at the higher MVPA intensity (mean difference, -2.4; 95% CI, -4.7 to -0.09; P = .042). They had fewer MVPA periods (mean difference, 29; 95% CI, -56.2 to -2.6; P = .032) and a different distribution of sedentary (mean difference,.033; 95% CI,.002 to.064; P = .039) and MVPA periods (mean difference,-.08; 95% CI,-.15 to -.01; P = .023). Conclusions: Detailed analyses of physical behavior showed that ambulatory fatigued persons with MS do differ from healthy controls not only in physical activity level, but also in other physical behavior dimensions (eg, day patterns, intensity, distribution).

To date, this assessment has not been subject to the same rigor and extent of psychometric evaluation as other widely-accepted measures of ambulatory (e.g., timed 25-foot walk (T25FW)). Objective: This study aimed to provide additional validity evidence for the SSST in 96 persons with MS, based on construct validity and precision. Construct validity involves examining the pattern of associations between the SSST and other measures, and precision involves comparing SSST performance relative to other valid measures of ambulation for differentiating between levels of disability status, MS clinical course, and fall risk based on balance confidence. Methods: All participants completed the SSST, T25FW, Timed Up-and-Go (TUG), six-minute walk, Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale-12, Late-Life Function and Disability Inventory, Activities-specific Balance Confidence, and Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test. All participants further underwent a neurological examination for generating EDSS scores, and then wore an ActiGraph accelerometer for the waking hours of a 7-day period. Results: SSST performance was strongly associated with other valid measures of ambulation (|rho| = .65.90) and disability status (rho = .73), moderately-to-strongly associated with balance confidence (rho = .58), and weakly-to-moderately associated with cognitive processing speed and non-ambulatory measures (|rho| = .35-.39). The SSST demonstrated stronger relative precision in discriminating between levels of disability status, MS clinical course, and fall risk based on balance confidence than the T25FW and TUG. Conclusions: We provide comprehensive validity evidence for the SSST that supports its consideration for inclusion alongside other highly-regarded objective measures of ambulatory function for clinical research and practice in persons with MS.

In addition, almost two-thirds of smartphone users access the internet through their phones. The progression in mobile communications has spurred high interest in developing applications for this crucial market. Everyday millions of applications are developed and made available through the different appstores, i.e., Google Play, Apple store, BlackBerry World, etc. With 91% of Americans owning one or more cellphones, this is a crucial market to tap into for application developers. Due to progress in the health sciences and people awareness of the importance of following a healthier lifestyle, people are living longer leading to a demographic change where more and more nations have rapidly growing aging population. Thus, there will be a shortage of doctors to care for this fast growing aging population. Moreover, as the population ages managing multiple chronic diseases becomes a daily challenge. Also, given the size of the population, many more people will be diagnosed with dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Hence, proper measures are needed to encourage this population to act and think independently while taking advantage of what current technologies are offering. This paper will focus on developing mobile applications targeted for assisting select underserved audiences with affordable emerging technologies on Android and iOS platforms. These mobile apps address areas such as medical, social, and practical needs of the consumers, as well as their caregivers.

However, gait variability's link to falls in persons with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS) is not well established. This investigation examined the relationship between stride-time variability, fall risk, and physiological fall risk factors in PwMS. 17 PwMS (62.8 +/- 7.4 years) and 17 age-matched controls (62.8 +/- 5.9 years) performed the 6-minute walk test. Stride-time was assessed with accelerometers attached to the participants' shanks. Stride-time variability was measured by interstride coefficient of variation (CV) of stride-time. The participant's fall risk was measured by the short form physiological profile assessment (PPA). A Spearman correlation analysis was used to determine the relationship between variables. Increased fall risk was strongly associated with increased stride-time CV in both PwMS (r = 0.71, p < 0.01) and the controls (rho = 0.67, p < 0.01). Fall risk was not correlated with average stride-time (p > 0.05). In PwMS, stride-time CV was related to postural sway (rho = 0.74, p < 0.01) while in the control group, it was related to proprioception (r = 0.61, p < 0.01) and postural sway (rho = 0.78, p < 0.01). Current observations suggest that gait variability is maybe more sensitive marker of fall risk than average gait parameters in PwMS. It was also noted that postural sway may be potentially targeted to modify gait variability in PwMS.;"[Moon, Yaejin; Wajda, Douglas A.; Motl, Robert W.; Sosnoff, Jacob J.] Univ Illinois, Dept Kinesiol & Community Hlth, 906 S Goodwin Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA";Moon, Y (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Kinesiol & Community Hlth, 906 S Goodwin Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.;ymoon9@illinois.edu;Sosnoff, Jacob/P-3397-2019;Sosnoff, Jacob/0000-0002-0286-9207;National Multiple Sclerosis SocietyNational Multiple Sclerosis Society [NMSS IL LOT 006];This project was funded in part by National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS IL LOT 006), which played no part in the investigation.;;42;18;18;0;0;HINDAWI LTD;LONDON;ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND;2090-2654;2090-2662;;MULT SCLER INT;Mult.

We anchored the Minimally Important Differences with an objective measure of ambulation, the accelerometer. Methods: This secondary analysis used longitudinal data from an observational study of symptoms and physical activity in 269 people with Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis. Participants completed a battery of PRO questionnaires, and then wore an accelerometer for seven days at each data collection time point every six months for 2.5 years. Statistical analysis first defined Change Groups on the basis of the performance-based accelerometer scores, anchored to 0.5 standard deviation change; then change was defined on the basis of published and linked MIDs for the PROs. Results: The performance-based (accelerometer) and PRO-based change distributions were stable overtime. Raw scores among the accelerometer and PRO measures were associated with large effect sizes, and PRO change scores were associated with each other but not with accelerometer change scores. Conclusions: These findings contradict a central assumption that may underlie clinical research studies: that a cross-sectional correlation implies that change in PROs will correspond with change in behavior/performance. Possible explanations related to accuracy of the performance-based measure, as well as response shift effects on the PROs are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

With an increase in the concentration of CML, the amount of BOD labels on biocathode surface increases, thus leading to the higher output of the as-prepared BFCs. This novel BFCs-based self-powered sensor showed a wide linear range for analyzing CML from 1 nM to 100 mu M with a detection limit of 0.2 nM, which was 50 times more sensitive than that determined from the conventional ELISA.

This has motivated the search for variables that act as determinants of physical activity. Such variables are derived from theory and presumably represent targets of behavioral interventions for increasing physical activity. Purpose This prospective, observational study examined variables from social cognitive theory as determinants of physical activity 6 weeks later in persons with RRMS. Methods Persons (N=68) with RRMS initially completed a questionnaire battery that included measures of self-efficacy, physical, social, and self-evaluative outcome expectations, functional limitations as an impediment, social support as a facilitator, and goal setting for physical activity. The participants wore an accelerometer and completed a self-reported physical activity measure 6 weeks later. Data were analyzed using path analysis in Mplus 3.0. Results Self-efficacy (path coefficient=0.19, p<0.05), functional limitations (path coefficient=-0.33, p<0.0001), and goal setting (path coefficient=0.26, p<0.01) had statistically significant direct effects on physical activity. Self-efficacy further had a statistically significant indirect effect on physical activity by way of functional limitations (path coefficient=0.12, p<0.05), but not by goal setting (path coefficient=0.02, p=0.66). This model explained 28 % of the variance in physical activity. Conclusions This prospective study suggests that self-efficacy, functional limitations, and goal setting might represent modifiable targets of behavioral interventions for increasing physical activity among persons with RRMS.;"[Suh, Yoojin; Joshi, Ina; Olsen, Conner; Motl, Robert W.] Univ Illinois, Dept Kinesiol & Community Hlth, Urbana, IL 61801 USA";Motl, RW (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Kinesiol & Community Hlth, 233 Freer Hall,906 South Goodwin Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.;RobMotl@illinois.edu;;;;;;41;13;13;0;17;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;1070-5503;1532-7558;;INT J BEHAV MED;Int.

Eighteen individuals with MS [divided into those who were independently ambulatory (n = 10) and those who were ambulatory with assistance (n = 8)] and 10 healthy controls performed a 6MW while recording spatiotemporal gait parameters using a pressure-sensitive walkway. Parameters recorded were walking velocity, cadence, step length and width, step time, percent of the gait cycle in double support, and variability of step length and width, step time, and double support. The ambulatory with assistance MS group had a significantly greater reduction in walking velocity (P = 0.000) over the course of the 6MW, which coincided with a significantly greater increase in step time and double support (P = 0.029) than in the other groups. Only the ambulatory with assistance MS group showed an increase in step-time variability and double-support variability during the 6MW (P's < 0.05). The novel results indicate that the reduction in velocity over prolonged walking occurs through a greater change in the temporal parameters of gait in persons with MS who require assistance while walking. In addition, the increase in gait variability in the individuals with MS who require assistance while walking indicates that the control over walking further deteriorates over the course of the 6MW.

This paper presents a quantitative characterization of multivariable ankle mechanical impedance of young healthy subjects when their muscles were relaxed, to serve as a baseline to compare with pathophysiological ankle properties of biomechanically and/or neurologically impaired patients. Measurements using a highly backdrivable wearable ankle robot combined with multi-input multi-output stochastic system identification methods enabled reliable characterization of ankle mechanical impedance in two degrees-of-freedom (DOFs) simultaneously, the sagittal and frontal planes. The characterization included important ankle properties unavailable from single DOF studies: coupling between DOFs and anisotropy as a function of frequency. Ankle impedance in joint coordinates showed responses largely consistent with a second-order system consisting of inertia, viscosity, and stiffness in both seated (knee flexed) and standing (knee straightened) postures. Stiffness in the sagittal plane was greater than in the frontal plane and furthermore, was greater when standing than when seated, most likely due to the stretch of bi-articular muscles (medial and lateral gastrocnemius). Very low off-diagonal partial coherences implied negligible coupling between dorsiflexion-plantarflexion and inversion-eversion. The directions of principal axes were tilted slightly counterclockwise from the original joint coordinates. The directional variation (anisotropy) of ankle impedance in the 2-D space formed by rotations in the sagittal and frontal planes exhibited a characteristic peanut shape, weak in inversion-eversion over a wide range of frequencies from the stiffness dominated region up to the inertia dominated region. Implications for the assessment of neurological and biomechanical impairments are discussed.;"[Lee, Hyunglae; Krebs, Hermano Igo; Hogan, Neville] MIT, Dept Mech Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Krebs, Hermano Igo] Univ Maryland, Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Krebs, Hermano Igo] Univ Maryland, Sch Med, Div Rehabilitat Med, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Hogan, Neville] MIT, Brain & Cognit Sci Dept, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA";Lee, H (corresponding author), Rehabil Inst Chicago, Chicago, IL 60611 USA.;"hyunglae@alum.mit.edu; hikrebs@mit.edu; neville@mit.edu";;;"NICHD NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [R01 HD069776] Funding Source: Medline; EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH & HUMAN DEVELOPMENTUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [R01HD069776, R01HD069776, R01HD069776, R01HD069776, R01HD069776] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER";;;38;20;22;0;9;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;1534-4320;1558-0210;;IEEE T NEUR SYS REH;IEEE Trans.

ObjectiveWe developed an innovative paradigm for investigation of DBS on human movement disorders. Temporary connection to the DBS electrode during implantable pulse generator (IPG) replacement permitted analysis of novel patterns of stimulation on motor symptoms, which could enhance efficacy and improve battery life. Materials and MethodsPatients enrolled in this prospective, Institutional Review Board-approved study underwent IPG replacement using local (monitored) anesthesia. Following device explant, the DBS electrode was connected to an external, isolated electrical stimulator using a sterile adapter cable. Different temporal patterns of stimulation were delivered while quantifying upper-extremity tremor (tri-axial accelerometry) or bradykinesia (finger-tapping). Upon experiment completion, the new IPG was implanted. ResultsAmong 159 IPG replacements from 2005 to 2011, 56 patients agreed to the research study (16 essential tremor [ET], 31 Parkinson's disease [PD], 5 mixed ET/PD tremor, 3 multiple sclerosis, 1 tremor/myoclonus). Surgical procedures were extended by 42 8.2min in 37 patients completing the study. Motor symptoms varied with stimulation pattern, with some patterns showing improved tremor or bradykinesia control. No postoperative infections or complications were observed in the 159 patients. ConclusionIPG replacement occurs when the DBS/brain interface is stable and patients demonstrate symptom reduction with known stimulation parameters. Conducting research at this time point avoids DBS implant issues, including temporary microlesion effects, fluctuating electrode impedances, and technical limitations of contemporary IPGs, providing advantageous conditions to conduct translational DBS research with minimal additional risk to research subjects.;"[Swan, Brandon D.; Grill, Warren M.] Duke Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Grill, Warren M.; Turner, Dennis A.] Duke Univ, Dept Neurobiol, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Grill, Warren M.; Turner, Dennis A.] Duke Univ, Dept Surg Neurosurg, Durham, NC 27710 USA";Turner, DA (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Durham, NC 27710 USA.;dennis.turner@duke.edu;;Grill, Warren/0000-0001-5240-6588;"NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R21 NS066115, R01 NS40894]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS) [R01NS079312, R01NS040894, R01NS079312, R01NS040894, R21NS066115, R01NS040894, R01NS079312, R01NS040894, R01NS040894, R01NS040894, R01NS040894, R01NS040894, R01NS040894, R01NS040894, R01NS040894, R01NS040894, R21NS066115, R01NS079312] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER";Financial Support: NIH Grants R21 NS066115 and R01 NS40894;;31;14;14;0;5;WILEY-BLACKWELL;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1094-7159;1525-1403;;NEUROMODULATION;Neuromodulation;JUL;2014;17;5;;;;;419;424;;10.1111/ner.12123;;;6;"Medicine, Research & Experimental; Clinical Neurology";"Research & Experimental Medicine; Neurosciences & Neurology";AN0JJ;WOS:000340270400006;24118257;Green Accepted;;;2021-03-18;

Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: University medical center. Participants: Persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) (n=40) were compared with similar aged control subjects (n=20). There were 20 subjects with MS in the normal walking velocity group and 20 subjects with MS who had slow walking velocity based on a timed 25-foot walk (T25FW) of <5 seconds. Interventions: None. Main Outcome Measures: Postural response latency, sway variables, trunk motion variables. Results: We found that subjects with MS with both slow or normal walking velocities had significantly longer postural response latencies than the healthy control group. Postural response latency was not correlated with the T25FW. Postural response latency was significantly correlated with center of pressure sway variables during quiet standing (root mean square: rho=.334, P=.04; range: rho=.385, P=.017; mean velocity: rho=.337, P=.038; total sway area: rho=.393, P=.015). Postural response latency was also significantly correlated with motion of the trunk during walking (sagittal plane range of motion: rho=.316, P=.05; SD of transverse plane range of motion: rho=-.43, P=.006). Conclusions: These findings clearly indicate that slow postural responses to external perturbations in patients with MS contribute to disturbances in balance control during both standing and walking.

However, studies examining this in the upper limbs are currently lacking. This study compared physical activity level (PAL) and recovery of upper limb muscle function following exercise between MS patients and healthy inactive controls. Furthermore, the relationship between PAL and muscle recovery was examined. Methods: PAL of 19 MS patients and 32 controls was measured using an accelerometer for 7 consecutive days. Afterwards, recovery of muscle function was assessed by performing a fatiguing upper limb exercise test with subsequent recovery measures. Results: Muscle recovery of the upper limb muscles was similar in both groups. Average activity counts were significantly lower in MS patients than in the control group. MS patients spent significantly more time being sedentary and less time on activities of moderate intensity compared with the control group. No significant correlation between PAL and recovery of muscle function was found in MS patients. Conclusions: Recovery of upper limb muscle function following exercise is normal in MS patients. MS patients are less physically active than healthy inactive controls. PAL and recovery of upper limb muscle function appear unrelated in MS patients. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Falls induce injuries that may lead to deconditioning and disabilities, which further increase the risk of falling. Therefore, an early gait stability index would be useful to evaluate patients in order to prevent the occurrence of future falls. Derived from chaos theory, local dynamic stability (LDS), defined by the maximal Lyapunov exponent, assesses the sensitivity of a dynamic system to small perturbations. LDS has already been used for fall risk prediction in elderly people. The aim of the present study was to provide information to facilitate future researches regarding gait stability in patients with neurological gait disorders. The main objectives were 1) to evaluate the intra-session repeatability of LDS in patients and 2) to assess the discriminative power of LDS to differentiate between healthy individuals and neurological patients. Eighty-three patients with mild to moderate neurological disorders associated with paresis of the lower extremities and 40 healthy controls participated in the study. The participants performed 2x30 s walking wearing a 3D accelerometer attached to the lower back, from which 2x35 steps were extracted. LDS was defined as the average exponential rate of divergence among trajectories in a reconstructed state-space that reflected the gait dynamics. LDS assessed along the medio-lateral axis offered the highest repeatability and discriminative power. Intra-session repeatability (intraclass correlation coefficient between the two repetitions) in the patients was 0.89 and the smallest detectable difference was 16%. LDS was substantially lower in the patients than in the controls (33% relative difference, standardized effect size 2.3). LDS measured in short over-ground walking tests seems sufficiently reliable. LDS exhibits good discriminative power to differentiate fall-prone individuals and opens up the possibility of future clinical applications for better prediction of fall risk in neurological patients.;"[Reynard, Fabienne; Vuadens, Philippe; Deriaz, Olivier; Terrier, Philippe] SUVACare, Clin Romande Readaptat, Sion, Switzerland; [Deriaz, Olivier; Terrier, Philippe] Inst Res Rehabil, Sion, Switzerland";Terrier, P (corresponding author), SUVACare, Clin Romande Readaptat, Sion, Switzerland.;Philippe.Terrier@crr-suva.ch;Terrier, Philippe/H-3831-2012;Terrier, Philippe/0000-0002-3693-4505;"Swiss accident insurance company SUVA; State of Valais; City of Sion; Clinique romande de readaptation";This study was supported by the Swiss accident insurance company SUVA, which is an independent, non-profit company under public law and by Clinique romande de readaptation.

It is hypothesized that increasing physical fitness and daily physical activity can lead to a seduction in fatigue. However, standard medical care following liver transplantation seldom includes rehabilitation that focuses on physical fitness and physical activity. Objective. The aim of this study was to explore whether a rehabilitation program can reduce fatigue in recipients of liver transplants. Furthermore, effects on physical fitness, physical activity, and cardiovascular risk were studied, and adherence, satisfaction, and adverse events were assessed. Design. This was an uncontrolled intervention study. Setting. The study took place in an outpatient rehabilitation clinic. Patients. Eighteen recipients of a liver transplant who were fatigued participated in a 12-week rehabilitation program including physical exercise training and counseling on physical activity. The primary outcome measure was fatigue. Other outcome measures were: aerobic capacity, muscle strength, body fat, daily physical activity, lipid profile, and glycemic control. All measurements were performed before and after the rehabilitation program. Adherence, satisfaction, and adverse events were registered. Results. After the program, participants were significantly less fatigued, and the percentage of individuals with severe fatigue was 22% to 53% lower than before the program. In addition, aerobic capacity and knee flexion strength were significantly higher, and body fat was significantly lower after the program. Participants were able to perform physical exercise at the target training intensity, no adverse events were registered, and attendance (93%) and mean patient satisfaction (8.5 out of 10, range=7-10) were high. Limitations. No control group was used in the study. Conclusions. A rehabilitation program consisting of exercise training and physical activity counseling is well tolerated and seems promising in reducing fatigue and improving fitness among recipients of liver transplants.;"[van den Berg-Emons, Rita J.

This requires development of a cut-point for interpreting the rate of accelerometer output based on its association with energy expenditure during physical activity. Objective: The current study measured activity counts from a waist-worn accelerometer and energy expenditure based on indirect calorimetry during three speeds of over-ground walking for deriving cut-points for interpreting accelerometer output in persons with mild, moderate, and severe MS disability. Methods: 54 participants with MS initially completed a neurological examination for generation of an EDSS score. Participants were then fitted with an ActiGraph model GT3X + accelerometer and a Cosmed portable metabolic system, and completed three, 6-minute walk (6 MW) tests that were interspersed with 10-15 min of rest. The first 6 MW was undertaken at a comfortable walking speed (CWS), and the two remaining 6 MW tests were undertaken above (faster walking speed) or below (slower walking speed) the participant's CWS in a counter-balanced order. Results: The linear association between activity counts per minute and energy expenditure did not differ between persons with mild and moderate MS disability, but it was significantly different among persons with severe disability. This resulted in disability-specific cut-points for MVPA of 1980 and 1185 counts per minute for groups with mild/moderate disability and severe disability, respectively. Conclusions: We believe that this research will facilitate a better understanding of time spent in MVPA across a broad range of MS disability. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Here we describe a new optical approach to measure fast redox signals with single-organelle resolution in living mice that express genetically encoded redox biosensors in their neuronal mitochondria. Moreover, we demonstrate how parallel measurements with several biosensors can integrate these redox signals into a comprehensive characterization of mitochondrial function. This approach revealed that axonal mitochondria undergo spontaneous 'contractions' that are accompanied by reversible redox changes. These contractions are amplified by neuronal activity and acute or chronic neuronal insults. Multiparametric imaging reveals that contractions constitute respiratory chain-dependent episodes of depolarization coinciding with matrix alkalinization, followed by uncoupling. In contrast, permanent mitochondrial damage after spinal cord injury depends on calcium influx and mitochondrial permeability transition. Thus, our approach allows us to identify heterogeneity among physiological and pathological redox signals, correlate such signals to functional and structural organelle dynamics and dissect the underlying mechanisms.;"[Breckwoldt, Michael; Pfister, Franz M.

ARAT provides a complete upper limb assessment, as it considers both proximal arm and hand, but suffers from subjectivity and poor sensitivity to mild impairment. In this study an instrumented ARAT is proposed to overcome these limitations and supplement the assessment of arm function in MS. Methods: ARAT was executed by 12 healthy volunteers and 21 MS subjects wearing a single inertial sensor on the wrist. Accelerometers and gyroscopes signals were used to calculate the duration of each task and its sub-phases (reaching, manipulation, transport, release and return). A jerk index was computed to quantify movement smoothness. For each parameter, z-scores were calculated to analyze the deviation from normative data. MS subjects were clinically assessed with ARAT score, Nine-Hole Peg test (9HPT) and Fahn Tremor Rating Scale (FTRS). Results: ARAT tasks executed by MS patients were significantly slower (duration increase: 70%) and less smooth (jerk increase: 16%) with respect to controls. These anomalies were mainly related to manipulation, transport and release sub-movements, with the former showing the greatest alterations. A statistically significant decrease in movement velocity and smoothness was also noticed in patients with normal ARAT score. Z-scores related to duration and jerk were strongly correlated with ARAT rating (r < -0.80, p < 0.001) and 9HPT (r < -0.75, p < 0.001) and were significantly different among MS sub-groups with different levels of arm impairments (p < 0.001). Moreover, Z-score related to manipulation-phase jerk was significantly correlated with the FTRS rating of intention tremor (r = 0.84, p < 0.001). Conclusions: The present study showed that the proposed method is able to discriminate between control and MS groups and to reveal subtle arm alterations not detectable from ARAT score. Validity was shown by high correlations between instrumental variables and clinical ratings. These results suggested that instrumented ARAT could be a valid quick and easy-to-use method for a sensitive quantification of arm function in MS. Inclusion of finger-mounted sensors could complement present findings and provide further indications about hand function in MS.;"[Carpinella, Ilaria; Ferrarin, Maurizio] Found Don C Gnocchi Onlus, Biomed Technol Dept, IRCCS, I-20148 Milan, Italy; [Cattaneo, Davide] Found Don C Gnocchi Onlus, LaRiCE Gait & Balance Disorders Lab, IRCCS, Dept Neurorehabil, I-20148 Milan, Italy";Carpinella, I (corresponding author), Found Don C Gnocchi Onlus, Biomed Technol Dept, IRCCS, Via Capecelatro 66, I-20148 Milan, Italy.;icarpinella@dongnocchi.it;"Ferrarin, Maurizio/I-3230-2012; Carpinella, Ilaria/K-1572-2016";"Ferrarin, Maurizio/0000-0002-7797-2399; Cattaneo, Davide/0000-0003-4251-1856; Carpinella, Ilaria/0000-0001-7486-0706";"Italian Ministry of Health (Ricerca Corrente and Ricerca Finalizzata)Ministry of Health, Italy [GR-2009-1604984]; Lombardy Region (Bando Ricerca indipendente)";This work was partly supported by funding from Italian Ministry of Health (Ricerca Corrente and Ricerca Finalizzata GR-2009-1604984) and from Lombardy Region (Bando Ricerca indipendente).

The current investigation examined and compared the accuracy of the StepWatch activity monitor and ActiGraph model GT3X+ accelerometer for capturing steps taken during various speeds of prolonged, over-ground ambulation in persons with MS who had mild, moderate, and severe disability. Methods: Sixty-three persons with MS underwent a neurological examination for generation of an EDSS score and undertook two trials of walking on the GAITRite electronic walkway. Participants were fitted with accelerometers, and undertook three modified six-minute walk (6MW) tests that were interspersed with 10-15 minutes of rest. The first 6MW was undertaken at a comfortable walking speed (CWS), and the two remaining 6MW tests were undertaken above (faster walking speed; FWS) or below (slower walking speed; SWS) the participant's CWS. The actual number of steps taken was counted through direct observation using hand-tally counters. Results: The StepWatch activity monitor (99.8%-99.9%) and ActiGraph model GT3X+ accelerometer (95.6%-97.4%) both demonstrated highly accurate measurement of steps taken under CWS and FWS conditions. The StepWatch had better accuracy (99.0%) than the ActiGraph (95.5%) in the overall sample under the SWS condition, and this was particularly apparent in those with severe disability (StepWatch: 95.7%; ActiGraph: 87.3%). The inaccuracy in measurement for the ActiGraph was associated with alterations of gait (e.g., slower gait velocity, shorter step length, wider base of support). Conclusions: This research will help inform the choice of accelerometer to be adopted in clinical trials of MS wherein the monitoring of free-living walking behavior is of particular value.";"[Sandroff, Brian M.; Motl, Robert W.; Pilutti, Lara A.; Learmonth, Yvonne C.; Ensari, Ipek; Dlugonski, Deirdre; Klaren, Rachel E.; Balantrapu, Swathi; Riskin, Barry J.] Univ Illinois, Dept Kinesiol & Community Hlth, Champaign, IL 61820 USA";Motl, RW (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Kinesiol & Community Hlth, Champaign, IL 61820 USA.;robmotl@illinois.edu;Ensari, Ipek/I-8930-2019;"Ensari, Ipek/0000-0001-7745-8501; Learmonth, Yvonne/0000-0002-4857-8480; Sandroff, Brian/0000-0002-2013-7632";Acorda Therapeutics;This research was supported by an investigator initiated grant from Acorda Therapeutics.

By comparison, very little is known about natural occurring change in physical activity over time. Such inquiry is important for identifying the rate, patterns, and predictors of change for the design and delivery of behavioral interventions in this population. The present study conducted latent growth modeling (LGM) and latent class growth analysis (LCGA) for understanding the rate, patterns, and predictors of change in physical activity over a 24-month period among persons with MS. Methods: On three occasions each separated by 12 months, persons (n = 269) with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) completed a battery of questionnaires that included assessment of physical activity behavior. Data were analyzed using Mplus 3.0. Results: The LGM indicated that a linear model provided a good fit to the data (chi(2) = 3.94, p = .05, CFI = .987, SRMR = .025), but the slope (M-s = 0.8) was nonsignificant (p > .05) and indicated no change in physical activity over time. LCGA identified a 2-class solution, and, based on the Lo-Mendell-Rubin likelihood ratio test, this model fit the data better than the 1-class solution. The 2-class solution consisted of low-active (similar to 80%) and high-active (similar to 20%) persons, but there was no change in physical activity over time per group. Sex and disability, but not age and disease duration, were predictors of being in the low active class. Conclusions: There was prevalent physical inactivity, but little interindividual and intraindividual change over 24 months in this cohort of persons with RRMS. Such results identify the importance of behavior interventions, perhaps early in the disease process wherein physical inactivity originates.;"[Motl, Robert W.; Mullen, Sean; Suh, Yoojin; McAuley, Edward] Univ Illinois, Dept Kinesiol & Community Hlth, Urbana, IL 61801 USA";Motl, RW (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Kinesiol & Community Hlth, 233 Freer Hall,906 South Goodwin Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.;robmotl@illinois.edu;Mullen, Sean/G-6453-2014;Mullen, Sean/0000-0002-8200-4026;National Multiple Sclerosis SocietyNational Multiple Sclerosis Society [RG 3926A2/1];This research was supported by a grant from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (RG 3926A2/1).;;28;6;6;0;14;AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC;WASHINGTON;750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA;0278-6133;1930-7810;;HEALTH PSYCHOL;Health Psychol.;APR;2014;33;4;;;;;326;331;;10.1037/a0032700;;;6;"Psychology, Clinical; Psychology";Psychology;AF2WZ;WOS:000334574500003;23668848;;;;2021-03-18;

Objective: We examined changes in depressive symptoms over a 30-month period and the demographic, clinical and behavioral predictors of such changes in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). Methods: 269 persons with RRMS completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and a demographic/clinical scale, Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ) and Patient Determined Disease Steps (PDDS) scale every 6 months over a 30-month period. Data were analyzed using latent class growth modeling (LCGM). Results: LCGM identified a two-class model for changes in HADS depression scores over time. Class 1 involved lower initial status (i.e. fewer depressive symptoms) and linear decreases in depressive symptoms over time (i.e. improving HADS scores), whereas Class 2 involved higher initial status (i.e. more depressive symptoms) and linear increases in depressive symptoms over time (i.e. worsening HADS scores). LCGM further indicated that being older (OR = 2.46; p < .05), married (OR = 2.62; p < .05), employed (OR = 4.29; p < .005) and physically active (OR = 2.71; p < .05) predicted a greater likelihood of belonging to C1 than C2. Conclusions: Depressive symptoms change over time in persons with RRMS, and the pattern of change can be predicted by modifiable and non-modifiable factors.";"[Ensari, Ipek; Motl, Robert W.; McAuley, Edward; Mullen, Sean P.] Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL USA; [Feinstein, Anthony] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada";Motl, RW (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Kinesiol & Community Hlth, 233 Freer Hall, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.;robmotl@illinois.edu;Mullen, Sean/G-6453-2014;"Mullen, Sean/0000-0002-8200-4026; Ensari, Ipek/0000-0001-7745-8501";National Multiple Sclerosis SocietyNational Multiple Sclerosis Society [3926A2/1];This work was supported by the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (grant number RG 3926A2/1).;;35;14;15;0;5;SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD;LONDON;1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND;1352-4585;1477-0970;;MULT SCLER J;Mult.

However, the real-time dynamics of beta-AR-mediated cAMP signaling in single live astrocytes and its effect on cell morphology have not been studied. We used the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based cAMP biosensor Epac1-camps to study time-dependent changes in [cAMP](i); morphological changes in primary rat astrocytes were monitored by real-time confocal microscopy. Stimulation of beta-AR by adrenaline, noradrenaline, and isoprenaline, a specific agonist of beta-AR, rapidly increased [cAMP](i) (similar to 15 s). The FRET signal response, mediated via beta-AR, was faster than in the presence of forskolin (twofold) and dibutyryl-cAMP (>35-fold), which directly activate adenylyl cyclase and Epac1-camps, respectively, likely due to slow entry of these agents into the cytosol. Oscillations in [cAMP](i) have not been recorded, indicating that cAMP-dependent processes operate in a slow time domain. Most Epac1-camps expressing astrocytes revealed a morphological change upon beta-AR activation and attained a stellate morphology within 1 h. The morphological changes exhibited a bell-shaped dependency on [cAMP](i). The 5-10% decrease in cell cross-sectional area and the 30-50% increase in cell perimeter are likely due to withdrawal of the cytoplasm to the perinuclear region and the appearance of protrusions on the surface of astrocytes. Because astrocyte processes ensheath neurons, beta-AR/cAMP-mediated morphological changes can modify the geometry of the extracellular space, affecting synaptic, neuronal, and astrocyte functions in health and disease.

Body-worn accelerometers and gyroscopes are able to detect gait and balance abnormalities in people with MS who have normal walking speeds. Few longitudinal studies exist using this technology to study the evolution of mobility deficits. The purpose of this study was to determine if body-worn sensors detected any decline in gait and balance measures in people with MS over time. Twenty-seven people with MS (13 mildly disabled, self-rated expanded disability status scale 0-3.5; 14 moderately disabled, SR-EDSS 4.0-5.5) who had normal walking speeds and 18 matched control subjects underwent gait and balance testing using body-worn sensors every 6 months for 18 months. While no parameter worsened over time, the moderately disabled MS cohort performed more poorly than the mildly disabled MS cohort who, in turn, was worse than control subjects for both objective and subjective walking and balance measures. Furthermore, the moderately disabled MS cohort demonstrated greater variation in between-visit performance than did the less disabled MS cohort or controls (Bonferroni-corrected p < 0.05).

Contemporary methods to assess the level of physical activity in PwMS are regular clinical observation. However, these methods either rely on high recall and accurate reporting from the patients (e.g. self-report questionnaires), or they are conducted during a particular clinical assessment with predefined activities. Therefore, the main aim of this pilot study was to develop an objective method to gather information about the real type and intensity of daily activities performed by PwMS in every-day living situations using an accelerometer. Furthermore, the accelerometer-derived measures are investigated regarding their potential for discriminating between different MS groups. Methods: Eleven PwMS that were able to walk independently (EDSS <= 5) were divided into two groups: mild disability (EDSS 1-2.5; n = 6) and moderate disability (EDSS 3 -5; n = 5). Participants made use of an activity monitor device attached to their waist during their normal daily activities over 4 measurements. Activity parameters were assessed and compared for the time of each participant's first measurement and follow-up measurement. Furthermore, differences between both subgroups, and the correlation of activity parameters with the clinical neurological variable (EDSS) were investigated. Results: Participants showed significant decline in step count (p = 0.008), maximum walking speed (p = 0.02) and physical activity intensity (p = 0.03) throughout the study period. Compared to the mild subgroup, moderate affected participant accumulated less number of steps (G1: 9214.33 +/- 2439.11, G2: 5018.13 +/- 2416.96; p < 0.005) and were slower (G1: 1.48 +/- 0.19, G2: 1.12 +/- 0.44; p = 0.03). Additionally, the EDSS correlated negatively with mean walking speed (r = -0.71, p = 0.01) and steps count (r = -0.54, p = 0.08). Conclusions: In this study, we used a portable activity monitoring sensor to gather information about everyday physical activity in PwMS at home. We showed that objective measurements using simple 3D accelerometers can track daily physical activity fluctuation. Furthermore, they track disability changes better than clinical measures. Thus, they can help to develop activity based treatments for PwMS.";"[Shammas, Layal; Zentek, Tom; Rashid, Asarnusch] FZI Forschungszentrum Informat, Karlsruhe, Germany; [von Haaren, Birte; Hey, Stefan] KIT, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Schlesinger, Stefan] Rhon Klinikum Bad Neustadt Saale, Neustadt An Der Saale, Germany";Shammas, L (corresponding author), FZI Forschungszentrum Informat, Karlsruhe, Germany.;shammas@fzi.de;;;;;;60;31;31;0;13;BMC;LONDON;CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND;;1475-925X;;BIOMED ENG ONLINE;Biomed.

A total of 82 MS patients were randomly allocated into intervention or wait-list control conditions. The intervention condition received a theory-based program for increasing physical activity behavior that was delivered via the Internet, and one-on-one video chat sessions with a behavior-change coach. Participants completed self-report measures of physical activity and disability status, and underwent the oral Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) and 6-minute walk (6MW) test before and after the 6-month period. Analysis using mixed-model ANOVA indicated a significant time x condition x disability group interaction on SDMT scores (p = 0.02, partial-eta (2) = 0.08), such that persons with mild disability in the intervention condition demonstrated a clinically meaningful improvement in SDMT scores (similar to 6 point change). There was a further significant time x condition interaction on 6MW distance (p = 0.02, partial-eta (2) = 0.07), such that those in the intervention condition demonstrated an increase in 6MW distance relative to those in the control group. The current study supports physical activity as a promising tool for managing cognitive impairment and impaired walking performance in persons with MS, and suggests that physical activity might have specific effects on cognition and non-specific effects on walking performance in this population.;"[Sandroff, Brian M.; Klaren, Rachel E.; Pilutti, Lara A.; Dlugonski, Deirdre; Motl, Robert W.] Univ Illinois, Dept Kinesiol & Community Hlth, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Benedict, Ralph H.

Methods: Eighty four participants with MS, without ocular disease or high myopia underwent a neurological examination for Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scoring, followed by OCT. Participants then wore an accelerometer during the waking hours of a 7-day period to objectively measure physical activity as steps/day. Results: Mean RNFL thickness for the sample was 91.46 mu m (SD= 15.0), and mean TMV was 6.61 mm(3) (SD=0.5). The mean score from the accelerometer was 4287 steps/day (SD= 2563). Steps/day was significantly associated with both RNFL thickness (Wald chi(2)=46.48, p<0.001) and TMV (Wald chi(2)=1798.27, p<0.001). After controlling for sex, MS subtype, disease duration, disability, and visual function, steps/day was significantly associated with TMV (Wald chi(2)=58.93, p<0.001), but not RNFL (Wald chi(2)=0.001, p=0.973). Conclusions: Physical activity was associated with integrity of the anterior visual pathway, assessed by OCT, in persons with MS, and this association was independent of sex, MS subtype, disease duration, disability, and visual function.

This study examined the validity of those MCID values based on capturing corresponding changes in other walking outcomes in persons with multiple sclerosis (MS). Methods: On 2 occasions separated by 6 months, 82 persons with MS completed the MSWS-12, timed 25-ft walk (T25FW), 6-min walk (6MW), and gait analysis, and then wore an accelerometer over a 7-day period. We generated change scores for the MSWS-12 and formed groups of stable, worsened, and improved perceived walking based on both 4- and 6-point changes. The groups were compared for corresponding changes in other walking measures over time using mixed-model ANOVAs. Results: The mixed-model ANOVAs did not identify statistically significant group-by-time interactions on the T25FW (p = 0.98 and p = 0.67), the 6MW (p = 0.89 and p = 0.72), gait (p = 0.54 and p = 0.21), or accelerometry (p = 0.40 and p = 0.68) for MCID values of 4- or 6-point changes in MSWS-12 scores. Conclusions: We did not confirm that MCID values of 4 and 6 points for the MSWS-12 correspond with changes in performance, gait, and free-living assessments of walking in MS. (C) 2014 S.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease that occurs due to loss of dopamine, a neurotransmitter and slow destruction of neurons. Brain area affected by progressive destruction of neurons is responsible for controlling movements, and patients with PD reveal rigid and uncontrollable gestures, postural instability, small handwriting and tremor. Commercial activity-promoting gaming systems such as the Nintendo Wii and Xbox Kinect can be used as tools for tremor, gait or other biomedical signals acquisitions. They also can aid for rehabilitation in clinical settings. This paper emphasizes the use of intelligent optical sensors or accelerometers in biomedical signal acquisition, and of the specific nonlinear dynamics parameters or fuzzy logic in Parkinson's disease tremor analysis. Nowadays, there is no screening test for early detection of PD. So, we investigated a method to predict PD, based on the image processing of the handwriting belonging to a candidate of PD. For classification and discrimination between healthy people and PD people we used Artificial Neural Networks (Radial Basis Function - RBF and Multilayer Perceptron - MLP) and an Adaptive NeuroFuzzy Classifier (ANFC). In general, the results may be expressed as a prognostic (risk degree to contact PD).;"[Geman, Oana] Stefan Cel Mare Univ Suceava, Fac Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Suceava 720229, Romania; [Geman, Oana] Stefan Cel Mare Univ Suceava, Dept Hlth & Human Dev, Suceava 720229, Romania; [Costin, Hariton] Grigore T Popa Univ Med & Pharm, Fac Med Bioengn, Iasi, Romania; [Costin, Hariton] Romanian Acad, Iasi Branch, Inst Comp Sci, Iasi, Romania";Geman, O (corresponding author), Stefan Cel Mare Univ Suceava, Fac Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Univ St, Suceava 720229, Romania.;geman@eed.usv.ro;GEMAN, OANA/J-3800-2014;"Geman, Oana/0000-0002-8347-8733; Costin, Hariton/0000-0002-1938-2817";;;;23;20;20;0;40;UNIV SUCEAVA, FAC ELECTRICAL ENG;SUCEAVA;UNIV SUCEAVA, FAC ELECTRICAL ENG, STEFAN CEL MARE, UNIVERSITATII 13, SUCEAVA, 720229, ROMANIA;1582-7445;1844-7600;;ADV ELECTR COMPUT EN;Adv.

Published work showed that cooling the upper limbs can reduce the severity of these symptoms thus improving the quality of lives of MS patients. Currently available cooling devices are large, heavy and power intensive. This work aims to develop a compact light weight wearable upper limb cooling device that can be used to reduce the skin temperature to 10 degrees C and for duration of 20 minutes. This work combines the heat pumping ability of thermoelectric devices together with the heat storage capability of PCM materials. Experimental work was carried out to investigate the performance of three different PCM materials. Results showed that PCM-OM37 with power input of 3W can deliver the required temperature of 10 degrees C for duration of 20 minutes highlighting the potential of this proposed technology.

This study examined the association between objectively-measured physical activity and cognitive processing speed (CPS) in a large sample of persons with MS. Patients (N=212) underwent two valid neuropsychological tests of CPS, completed the Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW), and wore an ActiGraph model GT3X accelerometer during the waking hours of a 7-day period for objectively measuring physical activity as steps/day. Physical activity was significantly associated with CPS (r=.39, p<.01), even when controlling for age, sex, and education (pr=.26, p<.01). This association was attenuated, but still significant after further controlling for T25FW performance (pr=.13, p=.03). Physical activity behavior is positively and independently, albeit weakly, associated with CPS in persons with MS, and may play an important role in managing this aspect of cognition as it does in other outcomes in MS.

The aim of this study is to correlate the visual analogue scale (VAS), a simple method for measuring subjective experience, with measures of walking ability used in clinical research of MS. The study included 82 ambulatory MSPs who have resided in the local community. The applied measures of walking ability were the following: the single-item and patient-rated Walking Ability Visual Analogue Scale (WA-VAS), the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), the 25-foot walk test (25FWT), the Six Spot Step Test (SSST), the 2 min timed walk (2 min TW), the Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale-12 (MSWS-12), and step activity monitor accelerometer (SAM) during 7 day period. The SAM analysis included the average daily step count, the average steps/min of the highest 1 min of a day, and the average steps/min of the highest continuous 60 min of a day. The WA-VAS scores significantly and strongly correlated with EDSS (rho = 0.679, P < 0.001), 25FWT (rho = 0.606, P < 0.001), SSST (rho = 0.729, P < 0.001), 2 min TW (rho = -0.643, P < 0.001), MSWS-12 (rho = 0.746, P < 0.001), average daily step count (rho = -0.507, P < 0.001), average steps/min of the highest 1 min of a day (rho = -0.544, P < 0.001), and average steps/min of the highest continuous 60 min of a day (rho = -0.473, P < 0.001). Correlations between WA-VAS and measures of walking ability used in clinical research of MS were satisfactory. The results obtained in this research indicate that the WA-VAS could be an instrument for simple measurement of walking limitations in MSPs in the clinical setting.;"[Grcic, Petar Filipovic; Matijaca, Meri; Bilic, Ivica; Dzamonja, Gordan; Lusic, Ivo; Caljkusic, Kresimir] Univ Hosp Ctr Split, Dept Neurol, Split 21000, Croatia; [Capkun, Vesna] Univ Hosp Ctr Split, Dept Nucl Med, Split 21000, Croatia";Grcic, PF (corresponding author), Univ Hosp Ctr Split, Dept Neurol, Spinciceva 1, Split 21000, Croatia.;pfg@hi.t-com.hr;"Dzamonja, Gordan/D-8384-2017; Lusic, Ivo/D-7706-2017; Bilic, Ivica/D-9538-2017";"Dzamonja, Gordan/0000-0002-4107-823X; Lusic, Ivo/0000-0002-0642-8257; Bilic, Ivica/0000-0002-0046-1486";;;;43;5;5;1;8;SPRINGER HEIDELBERG;HEIDELBERG;TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY;0300-9009;2240-2993;;ACTA NEUROL BELG;Acta Neurol.

Design: Secondary analysis of a combined data set of persons with MS and healthy controls from 13 previous investigations of physical activity over a 8-year period (2005-2013). Setting: University. Participants: Participants with MS (n = 800) were recruited primarily within Illinois through multiple sources, including print and e-mail flyers and an online advertisement on the National Multiple Sclerosis Society website. Healthy controls (n = 137) were recruited via public e-mail postings delivered across the university community. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Levels of MVPA and meeting public health guidelines for MVPA between persons with MS and controls. Results: After controlling for covariates (ie, age, sex, education, race, income), there was a moderate (d = .68) and statistically significant (F = 47.2, P<.001) difference of 13.1 minutes of MVPA per day (95% confidence interval, 9.4-16.8) between MS and controls. There was a difference in the rates of meeting public health guidelines for MVPA (x(2)=50.7, P<.001) between MS patients (20%) and controls (47%). Among those with MS, minutes of MVPA significantly differed as a function of education, employment status, clinical course, disease duration, and disability status. Conclusions: We provide data using an objective physical activity measure and a large sample to indicate that only a small proportion of persons with MS are achieving adequate amounts of daily MVPA.

Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the reliability, precision and clinically important change of the Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW), Six-Minute Walk (6MW), Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale-12 (MSWS-12) and accelerometry. Methods: Data were collected from 82 persons with MS at two time points, six months apart. Analyses were undertaken for the whole sample and stratified based on disability level and usage of walking aids. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) analyses established reliability: standard error of measurement (SEM) and coefficient of variation (CV) determined precision; and minimal detectable change (MDC) defined clinically important change. Results: All outcome measures were reliable with precision and MDC varying between measures in the whole sample: T25FW: ICC=0.991; SEM=1 s; CV=6.2%; MDC=2.7 s (36%), 6MW: ICC=0.959; SEM=32 m; CV=6.2%; MDC=88 m (20%), MSWS-12: ICC=0.927; SEM=8; CV=27%; MDC=22 (53%), accelerometry counts/day: ICC=0.883; SEM=28450; CV=17%; MDC=78860 (52%), accelerometry steps/day: ICC=0.907; SEM=726; CV=16%; MDC=2011 (45%). Variation in these estimates was seen based on disability level and walking aid. Conclusion: The reliability of these outcomes is good and falls within acceptable ranges.

The G protein (heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein)-coupled receptor (GPCR) GPR17, which is phylogenetically closely related to receptors of the purinergic cluster, has emerged as a modulator of CNS myelination. However, whether GPR17-mediated signaling positively or negatively regulates this critical process is unresolved. We identified a small-molecule agonist, MDL29,951, that selectively activated GPR17 even in a complex environment of endogenous purinergic receptors in primary oligodendrocytes. MDL29,951-stimulated GPR17 engaged the entire set of intracellular adaptor proteins for GPCRs: G proteins of the G alpha(i), G alpha(s), and G alpha(q) subfamily, as well as beta-arrestins. This was visualized as alterations in the concentrations of cyclic adenosine monophosphate and inositol phosphate, increased Ca2+ flux, phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), as well as multifeatured cell activation recorded with label-free dynamic mass redistribution and impedance biosensors. MDL29,951 inhibited the maturation of primary oligodendrocytes from heterozygous but not GPR17 knockout mice in culture, as well as in cerebellar slices from 4-day-old wild-type mice. Because GPCRs are attractive targets for therapeutic intervention, inhibiting GPR17 emerges as therapeutic strategy to relieve the oligodendrocyte maturation block and promote myelin repair in MS.;"[Hennen, Stephanie; Peters, Lucas; Merten, Nicole; Simon, Katharina; Spinrath, Andreas; Blaettermann, Stefanie; Schroeder, Ralf; Schulz, Daniel; Drewke, Christel; Gomeza, Jesus; Kostenis, Evi] Univ Bonn, Inst Pharmaceut Biol, Mol Cellular & Pharmacobiol Sect, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Wang, Haibo; Lu, Q.

There further are unresolved methodological issues such as the appropriate mode (i.e., written or oral administration) and measure (e.g., Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) & the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT)) of cognitive assessment. This prospective study further examined methodological issues influencing the association between physical activity and IPS in 82 persons with MS. Methods: Participants wore an accelerometer during the waking hours over 7 days for measuring physical activity as steps/day and six-months later completed two versions of the SDMT and the PASAT. Results: Steps/day was significantly, moderately, and similarly associated with oral (r(s) = .45, p < .01) and written (r(s) = .51, p < .01) SDMT performance, but weakly associated with scores on the PASAT (r(s) = .23, p = .02). After controlling for age and disability status as covariates of IPS, the associations among steps/day and oral (pr(s) = .25, p = .02) and written (pr(s) = .29, p = .01) SDMT performance were attenuated, but statistically significant, whereas after controlling for age and disability status, the association between steps/day and PASAT performance was not statistically significant (pr(s) = .12, p = .34). Conclusions: These results support inclusion of either oral or written administrations of the SDMT, rather than the PASAT, as measures of IPS in future physical activity interventions.

Objective: This study examined the clinical meaningfulness of steps/day using the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) value across stages representing the developing impact of MS. Methods: This study was a secondary analysis of de-identified data from 15 investigations totaling 786 persons with MS and 157 healthy controls. All participants provided demographic information and wore an accelerometer or pedometer during the waking hours of a 7-day period. Those with MS further provided real-life, health, and clinical information and completed the Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale-12 (MSWS-12) and Patient Determined Disease Steps (PDDS) scale. MCID estimates were based on regression analyses and analysis of variance for between group differences. Results: The mean MCID from self-report scales that capture subtle changes in ambulation (1-point change in PDSS scores and 10-point change in MSWS-12 scores) was 779 steps/day (14% of mean score for MS sample); the mean MCID for clinical/health outcomes (MS type, duration, weight status) was 1,455 steps/day (26% of mean score for MS sample); real-life anchors (unemployment, divorce, assistive device use) resulted in a mean MCID of 2,580 steps/day (45% of mean score for MS sample); and the MCID for the cumulative impact of MS (MS vs. control) was 2,747 steps/day (48% of mean score for MS sample).

Objective: This study aimed to determine the relation between real-life arm performance and clinical tests in MS. Methods: Thirty wheelchair-bound MS patients and 30 healthy controls were included. Actual and perceived real-life arm performance was measured by using accelerometry and a self-reported measure (Motor Activity Log). Clinical tests on 'body functions & structures' (JAMAR handgrip strength, Motricity Index (MI), Fugl Meyer (FM)) and 'activity' level (Nine Hole Peg Test (NHPT), Action Research Arm test) of the International Classification of Functioning were conducted. Statistical analyses were performed separately for current dominant and non-dominant arm. Results: For all outcome measures, MS patients scored with both arms significantly lower than the control group. Higher correlations between actual arm performance and clinical tests were found for the non-dominant arm (0.63-0.80). The FM (55%) was a good predictor of actual arm performance, while the MI (46%) and NHPT (55%) were good predictors of perceived arm performance. Conclusions: Real-life arm performance is decreased in wheelchair-bound MS patients and can be best predicted by measures on 'body functions & structures' level and fine motor control.

Cyclic voltammetric (CV) and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopic (EIS) methods were employed in determination of the electrode responses and applicability. Gelatin-MBP and gelatin-TiO2-MBP electrodes were prepared by chemical immobilization of the substrates onto the platinium electrodes. The formal potentials of MBP confined on gelatin-MBP and gelatin-TiO2-MBP surfaces are estimated to be 195 and 205 mV, respectively. Thus, a little more reversible electron transfer reaction occurs on the gelatin-TiO2-MBP immunosensor surface. The peak separations of MBP (150 mV and 110 mV s(-1) at 100 mV s(-1)) and the asymmetric anodic and cathodic peak currents indicate that the electron transfer between Anti-MBP and gelatin-MBP/gelatin-TiO2-MBP immunosensor is quasireversible. Control samples containing a nonspecific human immunoglobulin G (hIgG) antibody were also studied, and calibration curves were obtained by subtraction of the responses for specific and nonspecific antibody-based sensors. Gelatin-MBP and gelatin-TiO2-MBP immunosensors have detection limit of 0.1528 ng ml(-1) and 0.1495 ng ml(-1) respectively. This immunosensor exhibits high sensitivity and low response times (58 s for gelatin-MBP and 46 s for gelatin-TiO2-MBP immunosensor). The developed label-free impedimetric immunosensors also provide a simple and sensitive detection method for the specific determination of Anti-MBP in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum samples.

Physical activity is beneficial for people with multiple sclerosis (MS), but this population is largely inactive. There is minimal information on change in physical activity and its correlates for informing the development of behavioral interventions. Objective. This study examined change in physical activity and its symptomatic, social-cognitive, and ambulatory or disability correlates over a 2.5-year period of time in people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Methods. On 6 occasions, each separated by 6 months, people (N=269) with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis completed assessments of symptoms, self-efficacy, walking impairment, disability, and physical activity. The participants wore an accelerometer for 7 days. The change in study variables over 6 time points was examined with unconditional latent growth curve modeling. The association among changes in study variables over time was examined using conditional latent growth curve modeling, and the associations were expressed as standardized path coefficients (beta). Results. There were significant linear changes in self-reported and objectively measured physical activity, self-efficacy, walking impairment, and disability over the 2.5-year period; there were no changes in fatigue, depression, and pain. The changes in self-reported and objective physical activity were associated with change in self-efficacy (beta=.49 and beta=.61, respectively), after controlling for other variables and confounders. Limitations. The primary limitations of the study were the generalizability of results among those with progressive multiple sclerosis and inclusion of a single variable from social-cognitive theory.

For pathological populations, changes in variability during gait signal the presence of abnormal motor control strategies. For persons with multiple sclerosis (PwMS), extensive gait problems have been reported including changes in gait variability. While previous studies have focused on footfall variability, the present study used accelerometers on the trunk to measure variability during walking. Thus, the purpose of this study was to examine the variability of the acceleration pattern of the upper and lower trunk in PwMS compared to healthy controls. We extracted linear and nonlinear measures of gait variability from 30 s of steady state walking for 15 PwMS and 15 age-matched healthy controls. PwMS had altered variability compared to controls with greater Lyapunov exponent in the ML (p < 0.001) and AP (p < 0.001) directions, and greater frequency dispersion in the ML direction (p = 0.034). PwMS also demonstrated greater mean velocity in the ML direction (p = 0.045) and lower root mean square of acceleration in the AP direction (p = 0.040). These findings indicate that PwMS have altered structure of variability of the trunk during gait compared to healthy controls and agree with previous findings related to changes in gait variability in PwMS.;"[Huisinga, Jessie M.] Univ Kansas, Med Ctr, Landon Ctr Aging, Kansas City, KS 66160 USA; [Mancini, Martina; St George, Rebecca J.; Horak, Fay B.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Neurol, Beaverton, OR 97006 USA; [Huisinga, Jessie M.] Landon Ctr Aging, Kansas City, KS 66160 USA";Huisinga, JM (corresponding author), Univ Kansas, Med Ctr, Landon Ctr Aging, 3901 Rainbow Blvd,Mail Stop 1005, Kansas City, KS 66160 USA.;jhuisinga@kumc.edu;St George, Rebecca/O-5658-2017;St George, Rebecca/0000-0001-6206-1069;"National Multiple Sclerosis SocietyNational Multiple Sclerosis Society; Medical Research Foundation of Oregon; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGINGUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA) [R37AG006457, R37AG006457, R37AG006457, R37AG006457, R37AG006457, R37AG006457, R37AG006457, R37AG006457, R37AG006457, R37AG006457, R37AG006457, R37AG006457, R37AG006457, R37AG006457, R37AG006457, R37AG006457, R37AG006457, R37AG006457] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER";This study was funded by the National Multiple Sclerosis Society's Rehabilitation Research Training Grant and the Medical Research Foundation of Oregon's Early Clinical Investigator Award.;;57;53;53;0;15;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;0090-6964;1573-9686;;ANN BIOMED ENG;Ann.

Design: Cross-sectional design. Setting: General community. Participants: Convenience sample of persons with multiple sclerosis (N=645) recruited from the general community who were ambulatory and relapse free for 30 days. Mean age +/- SD of the participants was 46.3 +/- 10.6 years old. Participants were mostly women (85%), white (93%), and employed (64%). Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measure: Step counts measured by a motion sensor during a 7-day period. Results: The average value for the entire sample was 5903 +/- 3185 steps per day. This value varied by demographic and clinical characteristics, but not device type, and indicated that men, participants who were unemployed, had a high school education or less, progressive MS, a longer disease duration, and higher disability were less physically active based on the metric of steps per day. Conclusions: This study provides an expected value for average steps per day among persons with MS. Such an expected value for this population is an important first step to help researchers and clinicians interested in improving the overall health of persons with MS through physical activity promotion.

It aims at achieving personalization, modularity and maximization of the user's direct involvement in assistive systems. To this, MUNDUS exploits any residual control of the end-user and can be adapted to the level of severity or to the progression of the disease allowing the user to voluntarily interact with the environment. MUNDUS target pathologies are high-level spinal cord injury (SCI) and neurodegenerative and genetic neuromuscular diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Friedreich ataxia, and multiple sclerosis (MS). The system can be alternatively driven by residual voluntary muscular activation, head/eye motion, and brain signals. MUNDUS modularly combines an antigravity lightweight and non-cumbersome exoskeleton, closed-loop controlled Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation for arm and hand motion, and potentially a motorized hand orthosis, for grasping interactive objects. Methods: The definition of the requirements and of the interaction tasks were designed by a focus group with experts and a questionnaire with 36 potential end-users. Five end-users (3 SCI and 2 MS) tested the system in the configuration suitable to their specific level of impairment. They performed two exemplary tasks: reaching different points in the working volume and drinking. Three experts evaluated over a 3-level score (from 0, unsuccessful, to 2, completely functional) the execution of each assisted sub-action. Results: The functionality of all modules has been successfully demonstrated. User's intention was detected with a 100% success. Averaging all subjects and tasks, the minimum evaluation score obtained was 1.13 +/- 0.99 for the release of the handle during the drinking task, whilst all the other sub-actions achieved a mean value above 1.6. All users, but one, subjectively perceived the usefulness of the assistance and could easily control the system. Donning time ranged from 6 to 65 minutes, scaled on the configuration complexity. Conclusions: The MUNDUS platform provides functional assistance to daily life activities; the modules integration depends on the user's need, the functionality of the system have been demonstrated for all the possible configurations, and preliminary assessment of usability and acceptance is promising.";"[Pedrocchi, Alessandra; Ferrante, Simona; Ambrosini, Emilia; Gandolla, Marta; Casellato, Claudia; Ferrigno, Giancarlo] Politecn Milan, NeuroEngn & Med Robot Lab, NearLab, Dept Elect Informat & Bioengn, Milan, Italy; [Schauer, Thomas; Klauer, Christian] Tech Univ Berlin, Control Syst Grp, Berlin, Germany; [Pascual, Javier; Vidaurre, Carmen] Tech Univ Berlin, Fac Comp Sci, Machine Learning Grp, Berlin, Germany; [Gfoehler, Margit; Reichenfelser, Werner; Karner, Jakob] Vienna Univ Technol, A-1060 Vienna, Austria; [Micera, Silvestro; Crema, Andrea] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Ctr Neuroprosthet, Translat Neural Engn Lab, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Micera, Silvestro] Scuola Super Sant Anna, BioRobot Inst, Pisa, Italy; [Molteni, Franco; Rossini, Mauro; Palumbo, Giovanna; Guanziroli, Eleonora] Valduce Hosp, Villa Beretta Rehabil Ctr, Costa Masnaga, Lecco, Italy; [Jedlitschka, Andreas; Hack, Marco] Fraunhofer Inst Expt Software Engn, Kaiserslautern, Germany; [Bulgheroni, Maria; d'Amico, Enrico] Ab Acus, Milan, Italy; [Schenk, Peter; Zwicker, Sven; Duschau-Wicke, Alexander; Miseikis, Justinas; Graber, Lina] Hocoma AG, Volketswil, Switzerland";Pedrocchi, A (corresponding author), Politecn Milan, NeuroEngn & Med Robot Lab, NearLab, Dept Elect Informat & Bioengn, Milan, Italy.;alessandra.pedrocchi@polimi.it;"Ferrigno, Giancarlo/O-5833-2015; Schauer, Thomas/AAX-4118-2020; Jedlitschka, Andreas/AAJ-5524-2020; Pedrocchi, Alessandra/AAF-2655-2019; Schauer, Thomas/J-4137-2012; Micera, Silvestro/AAD-6630-2021; Ferrante, Simona/K-4122-2016; Ambrosini, Emilia/R-1371-2016; Gandolla, Marta/AAL-8862-2020; Gandolla, Marta/K-8813-2016; Pedrocchi, Alessandra/A-6634-2012";"Ferrigno, Giancarlo/0000-0001-5913-9451; Schauer, Thomas/0000-0002-0865-4418; Pedrocchi, Alessandra/0000-0001-9957-2786; Schauer, Thomas/0000-0002-0865-4418; Ferrante, Simona/0000-0002-7835-1965; Ambrosini, Emilia/0000-0002-6527-0779; Gandolla, Marta/0000-0001-5237-714X; Gandolla, Marta/0000-0001-5237-714X; Pedrocchi, Alessandra/0000-0001-9957-2786; Vidaurre, Carmen/0000-0003-3740-049X; Rossini, Mauro/0000-0002-7670-5758; casellato, claudia/0000-0002-8729-0391; Gfoehler, Margit/0000-0002-8977-8702";EU STREP MUNDUS [ICT-2009.7.2 - Accessible, Assistive ICT GA 248326];The work is supported by the EU STREP MUNDUS grant ICT-2009.7.2 - Accessible and Assistive ICT GA 248326.

This study provides a validation of accelerometer output based on associations with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), Patient Determined Disease Steps (PDDS) Scale, and Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale-12 (MSWS-12) scores, timed 25-foot walk (T25FW) and 6-min walk (6MW) performance, oxygen cost (O2 cost) of walking, and spatial and temporal parameters of gait. Materials and Methods 256 persons with MS completed the PDDS and MSWS-12, underwent an examination for the generation of an EDSS score, undertook two T25FW tests and a 6MW while wearing a portable metabolic unit for measuring the O2 cost of walking, completed two trials of comfortable walking on a GAITRite electronic walkway for measuring spatial and temporal parameters of gait, and then wore an Actigraph accelerometer during the waking hours of a 7-day period. Results The accelerometer output was significantly correlated with EDSS (=0.522), PDDS (=0.551), and MSWS-12 (=0.617) scores, T25FW (=0.595) and 6MW (=0.630) performance, and O2 cost of walking (=0.457). Regarding gait parameters, the accelerometer output was significantly correlated with velocity (=0.420), cadence (=0.349), step time (=0.353), step length (=0.395), double support (=0.424), and single support (=0.400).

To date, there is limited evidence regarding the validity of PDDS scores, despite its sound conceptual development and broad inclusion in MS research. This study examined the validity of the PDDS based on (1) the association with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores and (2) the pattern of associations between PDDS and EDSS scores with Functional System (FS) scores as well as ambulatory and other outcomes. Methods: 96 persons with MS provided demographic/clinical information, completed the PDDS and other PROs including the Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale-12 (MSWS-12), and underwent a neurological examination for generating FS and EDSS scores. Participants completed assessments of cognition, ambulation including the 6-minute walk (6 MW), and wore an accelerometer during waking hours over seven days. Results: There was a strong correlation between EDSS and PDDS scores (rho = .783). PDDS and EDSS scores were strongly correlated with Pyramidal (rho = .578 & rho = .647, respectively) and Cerebellar (rho = .501 & rho = .528, respectively) FS scores as well as 6 MW distance (rho = .704 & rho = .805, respectively), MSWS-12 scores (rho = .801 & rho = .729, respectively), and accelerometer steps/day (rho = -.740 & rho = -.717, respectively).

Results: The average age was 56 years, 64% were women, 92% were white, 86% had a high school degree or higher, and 56% walked with an assistive device or had limited self-mobility. The IPAQ and GLTEQ explained a small but statistically significant and unique amount of the variance in PHQ-9 scores in all diagnostic groups, with no significant differences in the relation by condition, age, or mobility status (IPAQ R-2=.004; GLTEQ R-2=.02; both P<.02).

Main Outcome Measures: Main outcome measures included the MSWS-12 and spatial and temporal gait parameters (walking speed, cadence, step length, step time, base of support [ie, the distance between 1 footfall and the line of progression of the opposing foot], and percentage of gait cycle spent in double support). Secondary outcomes included the timed 25-foot walk (T25FW), 6-minute walk (6MW), and Patient-Determined Disease Steps scale. Results: MSWS-12 scores were significantly correlated with walking speed (r=-.59), cadence (r=-.50), step length (r=-.53), step time (r=.46), base of support (r=.29), and percentage of the gait cycle spent in double support (r=.54). MSWS-12 scores further were significantly correlated with T25FW (r=.57) and 6MW (r=-.75) scores.

However, changes in its expression in the brain or cerebrospinal fluid are not fully specific for this type of dementia. Our previous study revealed that complexes of the enzyme and amyloid beta in cerebrospinal fluid could serve as a more specific biomarker of Alzheimer's disease than either the enzyme or amyloid beta individually when compared to autoimmune multiple sclerosis. In this study, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the surface plasmon resonance biosensor method were used to analyse cerebrospinal fluid of patients with various neuroinflammatory diseases. Significant differences in the levels of the total enzyme, complexes, amyloid beta 1-42 and total tau/phospho-tau were found in Alzheimer's disease patients while differences in complexes, total amyloid beta and amyloid beta 1-42 were observed in patients with neuroinflammatory diseases (except for multiple sclerosis) when compared to non-neuroinflammatory controls. The interactions of the enzyme with amyloid appeared to depend strongly on neuroinflammation-sensitive amyloid beta. Our data demonstrated that oligomerisation/aggregation of intracellular amyloid beta peptides was important in Alzheimer's disease while extracellular amyloid beta could play a role in neuroinflammatory diseases. Phospho-tau is currently the best biomarker of Alzheimer's disease.;"[Kristofikova, Zdena; Ripova, Daniela; Bartos, Ales; Ricny, Jan; Vrajova, Monika] Prague Psychiat Ctr, Prague 18103 8, Bohnice, Czech Republic; [Bartos, Ales; Cechova, Linda] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Med 3, Univ Hosp Kralovske Vinohrady, Prague 10034 10, Czech Republic; [Bockova, Marketa; Hegnerova, Katerina] ASCR, Inst Photon & Elect, Prague 18251 8, Czech Republic";Kristofikova, Z (corresponding author), Prague Psychiat Ctr, Alzheimer Dis Ctr, Ustavni 91, Prague 18103 8, Bohnice, Czech Republic.;kristofikova@pcp.lf3.cuni.cz;"Bartos, Ales/C-4353-2019; Ricny, Jan/V-1662-2018; Homola, Jiri/F-3683-2014";"Bartos, Ales/0000-0002-8020-8252; Ricny, Jan/0000-0003-2625-057X; Homola, Jiri/0000-0001-6258-015X";Internal Grant Agency of the Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic [NT 11225-4/2010];This work was supported by Internal Grant Agency of the Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic [grant number NT 11225-4/2010].;;24;7;7;0;20;BENTHAM SCIENCE PUBL LTD;SHARJAH;EXECUTIVE STE Y-2, PO BOX 7917, SAIF ZONE, 1200 BR SHARJAH, U ARAB EMIRATES;1567-2050;1875-5828;;CURR ALZHEIMER RES;Curr.

One consequence of this disease is the emergence of enhanced tremor. This study was designed to (1) compare the tremor responses of persons with MS to that of healthy adults and to (2) examine the impact of whole body position (i.e., seated/standing) on tremor. Bilateral postural tremor was recorded using accelerometers attached to each index finger. Results revealed some similarity of tremor between groups in regard to the principal features (e.g., presence of peaks in similar frequency ranges). However, significant differences were observed with tremor for the MS persons being of greater amplitude, more regular (lower ApEn) and more strongly coupled across limbs compared to the elderly. The effects of body position were consistent across all subjects, with tremor increasing significantly from sitting-to-standing. However, the tremor increase for the MS group was greater than the elderly. Overall, the tremor for MS group was negatively affected by both this disease process and the nature of the task being performed. This latter result indicates that tremor does not simply reflect the feed-forward output of the neuromotor system but that it is influenced by the task constraints. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Patients with minimal clinical disability have subtle gait changes. The aim of this study was to analyze the gait characteristics of MS patients in the absence of clinical disability. Method: A case-control study was carried out with 12 MS patients and 12 matched healthy controls. The subjects underwent a clinical neurological evaluation to determine their disability level (EDSS <= 1.5). Then, the subjects were referred for completion self-report questionnaires (gait, perceived balance confidence, physical activity and fatigue), gait clinical trials, and 3D kinematic analysis. Results: MS patients showed more impairment of perceived fatigue, perceived of walking impact and perceived balance confidence, despite having no disability. Gait characteristics showed no differences when they were determined by clinical observation. The 3D kinematic analysis of gait showed slight but significant changes in ankle movement. Conclusion: MS patients with no clinical disability have discrete changes in gait that can be evidenced by perceived impact on walking and kinematic evaluation, mainly of ankle movement. Moreover, there is a decrease in perceived balance confidence and an increase in perceived fatigue, which are correlated despite having different origins.;"[Calazans Nogueira, Leandro Alberto; Sabino, Pollyane; Alvarenga Filho, Helcio; Papais Alvarenga, Regina Maria; Thuler, Luiz Claudio] Univ Fed Estado Rio de Janeiro, Neurol Postgrad Program, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Calazans Nogueira, Leandro Alberto] Fed Inst Educ Sci & Technol Rio de Janeiro, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Teixeira, Luciano] Hosp Univ Gaffree & Guinle, BR-20270004 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Thuler, Luiz Claudio] Natl Canc Inst INCA, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil";Thuler, LC (corresponding author), Hosp Univ Gaffree & Guinle, Dept Neurol, Rua Mariz & Barros 775, BR-20270004 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.;lthuler@gmail.com;"Nogueira, Leandro AC/I-5563-2017; Papais-Alvarenga, Regina M/A-9385-2012";"Nogueira, Leandro AC/0000-0002-0177-9816; ";;;;39;29;29;1;18;TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0963-8288;1464-5165;;DISABIL REHABIL;Disabil.

Method: The sample included 41 cases of MS and 41 controls matched by age, sex, height and weight. Participants concurrently wore 7164 and GT3X accelerometers for 6 days under free-living conditions, and undertook up to five, 6-minute periods of walking at five speeds on a motor-driven treadmill. Results: Under free-living conditions, there was substantial, but not absolute, agreement (Intraclass correlation = 0.983) between devices and the output from the model 7164 accelerometer was significantly greater (p < 0.01) than that of the GT3X, resulting in a 7.0% difference between devices. The treadmill-walking conditions indicated that this difference in output between accelerometers was based on slow-walking speeds where there was a statistically significant (p < 0.01) and 30.3% discrepancy. Conclusions: The ActiGraph model 7164 and GT3X accelerometers are not interchangeable under free-living conditions, and the discrepancy in measurement between devices might be explained by the difference in output under slow-walking conditions. Researchers and clinicians should be aware of the difference in output between generations of ActiGraph accelerometers, and perhaps other brands, in future applications involving persons with MS and controls.;"[Sandroff, Brian M.; Motl, Robert W.] Univ Illinois, Dept Kinesiol & Community Hlth, Urbana, IL 61801 USA";Motl, RW (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Kinesiol & Community Hlth, 233 Freer Hall,906 South Goodwin Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.;robmotl@illinois.edu;;Sandroff, Brian/0000-0002-2013-7632;Foundation of the Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers;The Authors report no declarations of interest.

The natural closed-loop sensory-motor feedback system is imitated by a wearable virtual reality apparatus, employing body-mounted inertial sensors and responding dynamically to the patient's own motion. Clinical trials have shown a significant gait improvement in patients with Parkinson's disease using the apparatus. In contrast to open-loop devices, which impose constant-velocity visual cues in a treadmill fashion, or rhythmic auditory cues in a metronome fashion, requiring constant vigilance and attention strategies, and, in some cases, instigating freezing in Parkinson's patients, the closed-loop device improved gait parameters and eliminated freezing in most patients, without side effects. Patients with multiple sclerosis, previous stroke, senile gait, and cerebral palsy using the device also improved their balance and gait substantially. Training with the device has produced a residual improvement, suggesting virtual sensory feedback for the treatment of neurological movement disorders.;[Baram, Yoram] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel;Baram, Y (corresponding author), Technion Israel Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel.;baram@cs.technion.ac.il;;;;;;43;23;24;1;19;FRONTIERS MEDIA SA;LAUSANNE;AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND;1664-2295;;;FRONT NEUROL;Front.

Treatment of diseases and conditions like MS may be time sensitive, and deflection cantilevers are a promising platform for real-time measurement of biomarker proteins. Additionally, linking procedures have a substantial effect on the sensitivity of deflection cantilever measurements. Therefore, successful detection of IFN-gamma using three different linking procedures is presented. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to confirm the efficacy of the linking procedures before they were implemented on cantilever deflection arrays. The steady state change in surface stress due to IFN-gamma binding was determined to be 0.16 +/- 0.09, -0.11 +/- 0.04 and -0.08 +/- 0.06 N/m for the glutaraldehyde, Prolinker B and 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl] carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC)/N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (Sulfo-NHS) linking procedures, respectively. Furthermore, R-2 values near 1 indicate good correlation between an exponential model for antibody-antigen binding and cantilever deflection. Steady state deflection of 667.3 +/- 0.1, -452.0 +/- 0.0, and -406.2 +/- 0.2 nm and rate constants of 0.4582 +/- 0.0003, 0.4737 +/- 0.0000 and 0.1766 +/- 0.0002 1/h were calculated for the glutaraldehyde, Prolinker B and EDC/Sulfo-NHS linking procedures, respectively.

It can continuously measure electrocardiogram, body-skin temperature, electromyogram and motions of feet. The goal of this study is to test the ability of distinguishing fatigued MS patients from healthy subjects by the use of FAMOS. This paper presents the realization of the measurement system including the design of both hardware and dedicated signal processing algorithms. Twenty-six participants including 17 MS patients with fatigue and 9 sex-and age-matched healthy controls were included in the study for continuous 24 h monitoring. The preliminary results show significant differences between fatigued MS patients and healthy controls. In conclusion, the FAMOS enables continuous data acquisition and estimation of multiple physiological and functional parameters. It provides a new, flexible and objective approach to study fatigue in MS, which can distinguish between fatigued MS patients and healthy controls.

Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: University research room. Participants: People with MS who used at most a stick to walk outdoors (MS-A; n=19), people with MS who used bilateral support for gait (MS-B; n=11), and healthy controls (n=15). Interventions: Participants completed 85 minutes of 9 scripted everyday activities. Main Outcome Measures: Estimates of metabolic equivalent thresholds (METs) and kilocalories from a portable metabolic system, and steps counted from video of the activities. Step and MET estimates from an integrative accelerometer and from a uniaxial accelerometer, and kilocalorie estimates from the integrative accelerometer. Results: The uniaxial accelerometer had >30% error for steps for all groups. MET estimates had an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) <0.2 for all groups. For the integrative accelerometer, step estimates for controls had an ICC of .69 and <1% error. The step estimates for MS-A and MS-B groups had >20% error.

ICCs were all >.67, and mean differences from criterion were <20kcal. Conclusions: The agreement between steps and MET estimates from both devices and the criterion was poor, particularly for people with MS. Only the step and MET estimates for the control group for the integrative accelerometer were not significantly different from the criterion.

However, no studies to date have systematically evaluated the benefits of an intervention for both managing fatigue and promoting physical activity in individuals with MS. This study involves a randomized controlled trial to examine the effectiveness of a telehealth intervention that supports individuals with MS in managing fatigue and increasing physical activity levels. Methods/Design: A randomly-allocated, three-parallel group, time-series design with a social support program serving as the control group will be used to accomplish the purpose of the study. Our goal is to recruit 189 ambulatory individuals with MS who will be randomized into one of three telehealth interventions: (1) a contact-control social support intervention, (2) a physical activity-only intervention, and (3) a physical activity plus fatigue management intervention. All interventions will last 12 weeks and will be delivered entirely over the phone. Our hypothesis is that, in comparison to the contact-control condition, both the physical activity-only intervention and the physical activity plus fatigue management intervention will yield significant increases in physical activity levels as well as improve fatigue and health and function, with the physical activity plus fatigue management intervention yielding significantly larger improvements. To test this hypothesis, outcome measures will be administered at Weeks 1, 12, and 24. Primary outcomes will be the Fatigue Impact Scale, the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ), and Actigraph accelerometers. Secondary outcomes will include the SF-12 Survey, Mental Health Inventory, Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale, the Community Participation Indicator, and psychosocial constructs (e. g., self-efficacy). Discussion: The proposed study is novel, in that it represents a multi-disciplinary effort to merge two promising lines of research on MS: fatigue management and physical activity promotion. Collectively, the proposed study will be the largest randomized controlled trial to examine the effects of a lifestyle physical activity intervention in people with MS.;"[Plow, Matthew] Cleveland Clin, Lerner Res Inst, Dept Biomed Engn, Dept Phys Med & Rehabil, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA; [Finlayson, Marcia] Queens Univ, Sch Rehabil Therapy, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada; [Motl, Robert W.] Univ Illinois, Dept Kinesiol & Community Hlth, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Bethoux, Francois] Cleveland Clin, Mellen Ctr Multiple Sclerosis Treatment & Res, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA";Plow, M (corresponding author), Cleveland Clin, Lerner Res Inst, Dept Biomed Engn, Dept Phys Med & Rehabil, 9500 Euclid Ave,ND-20, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA.;plowm@ccf.org;Finlayson, Marcia/N-5803-2019;Finlayson, Marcia/0000-0002-1774-4810;National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS)National Multiple Sclerosis Society;This work was supported through the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS).

Forty-four participants completed 4 trials of walking on a GAITRite mat and one 6-minute trial of walking on a treadmill at a constant, controlled speed of 54 m min(-1) while expired gases were analyzed for oxygen consumption. Participants also completed the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and wore a waist-mounted accelerometer for 7 days. Results. C-w was significantly and inversely associated with gait speed (r = -.25) and stride length (r = -.32) and positively associated with double limb support (r = .27). C-w was significantly and inversely associated with daily accelerometer activity counts (r = -.35) and positively associated with FSS scores (rho = .31). Conclusion. The results support the development and application of rehabilitation strategies to address impaired gait parameters as an approach to improve C-w, daily activities, and fatigue.;[Motl, Robert W.] Univ Illinois, Dept Kinesiol & Community Hlth, Urbana, IL 61801 USA;Motl, RW (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Kinesiol & Community Hlth, 350 Freer Hall,906 S Goodwin Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.;robmotl@uiuc.edu;Sosnoff, Jacob/P-3397-2019;"Sosnoff, Jacob/0000-0002-0286-9207; Sandroff, Brian/0000-0002-2013-7632";Foundation of the Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers;The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by a grant from the Foundation of the Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers.;;24;54;56;1;15;SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC;THOUSAND OAKS;2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA;1545-9683;1552-6844;;NEUROREHAB NEURAL RE;Neurorehabil.

This study compared physical activity levels between large samples of persons with mild MS and matched controls using validated measures of physical activity. Materials and methods The sample included 77 cases of MS and 77 controls matched on age, height, weight, and gender. Physical activity was assessed using five measures, namely the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ), International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), and activity counts per day, step counts per day, and time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) per day by accelerometry. Results There were statistically significant differences between groups in accelerometer activity counts (t = -3.87, P = 0.0001), accelerometer step counts (t = -4.29, P = 0.0001), time spent in MVPA (t = -2.39, P = 0.01), GLTEQ scores (t = -3.83, P = 0.0001), and IPAQ scores (t = -3.42, P = 0.0001). The average effect size across all five measures was d = -0.59 and indicated that persons with MS overall were moderately less physically active than the matched controls. Conclusions The primary finding was a moderate reduction in physical activity among those with MS, but the magnitude was substantially smaller than reported in a published meta-analysis. Importantly, the degree of physical inactivity can likely be overcome through the delivery of behavioral interventions for increasing physical activity and this should translate into meaningful consequences for persons with MS.;"[Sandroff, B.

This underscores the importance of considering alternative, ecologically valid approaches, such as commercially available accelerometers, for measuring community ambulation in individuals with MS. This consideration is warranted based on problems with existing measures of ambulation in MS (e.g., poor responsiveness and patient clinician discordance); conceptual associations among MS pathology, impairment and gait function with relevance for the signal detected by accelerometers; assumptions that are empirically supported for the application of commercially available accelerometers as a measure of community ambulation; and evidence supporting the output of commercially available accelerometers as a measure of ambulation.

However, in the literature there are only a few papers that address this disorder. The aim of this study is to identify objectively subclinical abnormal gait strategies in these patients. Methods: Eleven patients affected by self-reported unsteadiness during gait (4 TBI and 7 MS) and ten healthy subjects underwent gait analysis while walking back and forth on a 15-m long corridor. Time-distance parameters, ankle sagittal motion, and muscular activity during gait were acquired by a wearable gait analysis system (Step32, DemItalia, Italy) on a high number of successive strides in the same walk and statistically processed. Both self-selected gait speed and high speed were tested under relatively unconstrained conditions. Non-parametric statistical analysis (Mann-Whitney, Wilcoxon tests) was carried out on the means of the data of the two examined groups. Results: The main findings, with data adjusted for velocity of progression, show that increased double support and reduced velocity of progression are the main parameters to discriminate patients with self-reported unsteadiness from healthy controls. Muscular intervals of activation showed a significant increase in the activity duration of the Rectus Femoris and Tibialis Anterior in patients with respect to the control group at high speed. Conclusions: Patients with a subjective sensation of instability, not clinically documented, walk with altered strategies, especially at high gait speed. This is thought to depend on the mechanisms of postural control and coordination. The gait anomalies detected might explain the symptoms reported by the patients and allow for a more focused treatment design. The wearable gait analysis system used for long distance statistical walking assessment was able to detect subtle differences in functional performance monitoring, otherwise not detectable by common clinical examinations.;"[Benedetti, Maria Grazia] Ist Ortoped Rizzoli, Phys Med & Rehabil Unit, Bologna, Italy; [Agostini, Valentina; Knaflitz, Marco] Politecn Torino, Dipartimento Elettron & Telecomun, Turin, Italy; [Gasparroni, Verusca; Boschi, Marco] Univ Bologna, Movement Anal Lab, Ist Ortoped Rizzoli, Bologna, Italy; [Piperno, Roberto] Maggiore Hosp, Rehabil Div, Bologna, Italy";Benedetti, MG (corresponding author), Ist Ortoped Rizzoli, Phys Med & Rehabil Unit, Bologna, Italy.;benedetti@ior.it;"Piperno, Roberto/AAC-3000-2021; Agostini, Valentina/A-9570-2009; Leardini, Alberto/C-8189-2019";"Piperno, Roberto/0000-0002-2251-9191; Agostini, Valentina/0000-0001-5887-1499; Leardini, Alberto/0000-0003-3547-7370; Benedetti, Maria Grazia/0000-0002-2623-8506";Italian Ministry of HealthMinistry of Health, Italy [ICS 120.3/RF99.92];Acknowledgements: This study was supported by research grants from the Italian Ministry of Health n.

Here we investigated the effect of different types of augmented visual information feedback on finger tremor and on inter-limb tremor coordination. Four visual information conditions of postural finger tremor from either the dominant hand only or from both hands were investigated. The visual conditions were: (1) no vision, (2) natural vision, (3) augmented vision with instantaneous acceleration on a computer display, and (4) augmented vision with instantaneous and past acceleration on a computer display. Acceleration was measured with a 3D accelerometer on the distal phalanx of the index finger(s). The amount of tremor variability did not change as a function of visual information conditions. However, removing visual feedback increased tremor predictability and reduced small, random deviations of tremor acceleration output in the one finger condition. In the two-finger condition, augmented visual information increased the irregularity of the combined tremor variability. The no vision condition showed a stronger coupling between fingers than natural vision or augmented vision with past information. The findings revealed that augmented visual information increased tremor irregularity and facilitated coupling in two-hand tremor dynamics.;"[Loncharich, Michael F.; Newell, Karl M.] Penn State Univ, Dept Kinesiol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA";Loncharich, MF (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Kinesiol, 275 Rec Hall, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.;loncharich@psu.edu;;;;;;36;1;1;0;8;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;1439-6319;;;EUR J APPL PHYSIOL;Eur.

This application would be strengthened by including objective measures of walking mobility along with a matched control sample for verifying specificity versus generality in accelerometer output. We compared associations among accelerometer output, walking mobility, and physical activity between persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) and controls without a neurological disorder. Sixty-six persons (33 MS, 33 matched controls) completed a battery of questionnaires, performed the six-minute walk (6MW) and timed-up-and-go (TUG), and wore an accelerometer for a 7-day period. After this period, participants completed the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ) and International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Accelerometer output was significantly correlated with only mobility measures (6MW, rho =.78; TUG, rho = -.68) in MS, whereas it correlated with both mobility (6MW, rho =.58; TUG, rho = -.49) and physical activity (GLTEQ rho = .56; IPAQ, rho = .53) measures in controls. Regression analysis indicated that only 6MW explained variance in accelerometer output in MS (beta = .65, R-2 = .43). These findings support the possibility that accelerometers primarily and specifically measure real-life walking mobility, not physical activity, in persons with MS. (C) 2011 IPEM.

A population of 60 healthy blood donors and 61 multiple sclerosis patients has been screened. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC)-based analysis has established the optimal diagnostic cut-off value for the method obtaining a sensitivity of 36% and a specificity of 95%.

This prevents early detection and intervention for mobility problems. The study sought to determine if body-worn sensors could detect differences in balance and gait between people with MS with normal walking speeds and healthy controls. Thirty-one MS and twenty-eight age- and sex-matched control subjects were tested using body-worn sensors both during quiet stance and gait (Timed Up and Go test, TUG). Results were compared to stopwatch-timed measures. Stopwatch durations of the TUG and Timed 25 Foot Walk tests were not significantly different between groups. However, during quiet stance with eyes closed, people with MS had significantly greater sway acceleration amplitude than controls (p = 0.02). During gait, people with MS had greater trunk angular range of motion in roll (medio-lateral flexion, p = 0.017) and yaw (axial rotation, p = 0.026) planes. Turning duration through 180 degrees was also longer in MS (p = 0.031). Thus, body-worn motion sensors detected mobility differences between MS and healthy controls when traditional timed tests could not. This portable technology provides objective and quantitative mobility data previously not obtainable in the clinic, and may prove a useful outcome measure for early mobility changes in MS.

This recommendation has not been based on physiological considerations such as the rate of oxygen consumption (V center dot O-2) over the 6MW range. Objective: This study examined the pattern of change in V center dot O-2 over the range of the 6MW in a large sample of persons with MS who varied as a function of disability status. Method: Ninety-five persons with clinically-definite MS underwent a neurological examination for generating an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score, and then completion of the 6MW protocol while wearing a portable metabolic unit and an accelerometer. Results: There was a time main effect on V center dot O-2 during the 6MW (p = .0001) such that V center dot O-2 increased significantly every 30 seconds over the first 3 minutes of the 6MW, and then remained stable over the second 3 minutes of the 6MW. This occurred despite no change in cadence across the 6MW (p = .84). Conclusions: The pattern of change in V center dot O-2 indicates that there are different metabolic systems providing energy for ambulation during the 6MW in MS subjects and steady state aerobic metabolism is reached during the last 3 minutes of the 6MW. By extension, the first 3 minutes would represent a test of mixed aerobic and anaerobic work, whereas the second 3 minutes would represent a test of aerobic work during walking.;"[Motl, Robert W.; Suh, Yoojin; Balantrapu, Swathi; Sandroff, Brian M.; Sosnoff, Jacob J.] Univ Illinois, Dept Kinesiol & Community Hlth, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Pula, John] Univ Illinois, Sch Med, Peoria, IL 61603 USA; [Goldman, Myla D.] Univ Virginia, Dept Neurol, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; [Fernhall, Bo] Univ Illinois, Coll Appl Hlth Sci, Chicago, IL 60612 USA";Motl, RW (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Kinesiol & Community Hlth, 233 Freer Hall, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.;robmotl@illinois.edu;"Goldman, Myla D/D-1955-2017; Sosnoff, Jacob/P-3397-2019; Goldman, Myla/AAG-8737-2020";"Sosnoff, Jacob/0000-0002-0286-9207; Goldman, Myla/0000-0002-5675-945X; Sandroff, Brian/0000-0002-2013-7632";"OSF Foundation Hospital; Biogen IDECBiogen; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS) [K23NS062898, K23NS062898, K23NS062898, K23NS062898, K23NS062898] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER";RWM and MGD both have consulting contracts with Biogen IDEC and Acorda Therapeutics.

Method: The samples included 18 persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) from Study 1 and 20 from Study 2 who were randomized into treatment arms of the intervention. The participants initially wore an accelerometer over a 7-day period for collection of baseline data, and one week later wore a pedometer over a 7-day period for collection of data for self-monitoring and goal setting in week 1 of the 12-week intervention. The accelerometer and pedometer data were both expressed in average steps per day over a 7-day period. Results: There was a moderate (d = .56), statistically significant (p = .03) difference of 1,822 steps per day between baseline and week 1 of the intervention in Study 1. There was a large (d = 1.36), statistically significant (p = .0001) difference of 2,338 steps per day in Study 2.

Robot-assisted gait training (RAGT) has been suggested as an intervention to improve walking capacity in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Objective. This study aimed to evaluate whether RAGT (Lokomat) is superior to over-ground walking training in terms of quality of life, activity level, and gait. Methods. A total of 67 patients with MS with the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) 3.0 to 6.5 were randomized to walking or RAGT, in addition to multimodal rehabilitation. Primary outcomes were walking speed, activity level (estimated metabolic equivalent, metabolic equivalents [METs], using an accelerometer), and quality of life (Well-Being Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and EQ-5D European VAS. Results. In all, 49 patients finished the interventions. Mean age was 56 years (range 36-74 years), mean EDSS was 5.8 (3.0-6.5), and the preferred walking speed at baseline was 0.56 m/s (0.06-1.43 m/s). Before rehabilitation, participants spent on average 68 min/d at an MET >= 3. The walking group improved gait speed nonsignificantly more than the RAGT; the upper bound of the confidence interval (CI) did not exclude a clinically relevant benefit (defined as a difference of 0.05 m/s) in favor of the walking group; the lower bound of the CI did exclude a clinically important benefit in favor of the Lokomat. Quality of life improved in both groups, with a nonsignificant between-group difference in favor of the walking group. Both groups had reduced their activity by 8 weeks after the rehabilitation. Conclusion. It is unlikely that RAGT is better than over-ground walking training in patients with an EDSS between 3.0 and 6.5.";"[Lugon-Moulin, Veronique; Meichtry, Andre; Hilfiker, Roger] Univ Appl Sci Western Switzerland, HES SO Valais, CH-1950 Sion, Switzerland; [Vaney, Claude; Gattlen, Brigitte; Lugon-Moulin, Veronique; Hausammann, Rita; Foinant, Denise; Anchisi-Bellwald, Anne-Marie; Palaci, Cecilia] Berner Klin Montana, Crans Montana, Switzerland; [Lugon-Moulin, Veronique; Meichtry, Andre; Hilfiker, Roger] ReSaR Reseau Etud Appl Prat Sante Readaptat Re In, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Hilfiker, Roger] Inst Rech Readaptat, Sion, Switzerland; [Hilfiker, Roger] Clin Romande Readaptat Suvacare, Sion, Switzerland";Hilfiker, R (corresponding author), Univ Appl Sci Western Switzerland, HES SO Valais, CH-1950 Sion, Switzerland.;roger.hilfiker@hevs.ch;Hilfiker, Roger/E-2846-2010;Hilfiker, Roger/0000-0001-8662-6116;"fonds strategique HES-SO/ReSaR; Berner Klinik Montana; University of Applied Sciences Western Switzerland, Institut Sante Social";The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The trial was supported by a grant from the fonds strategique HES-SO/ReSaR to Roger Hilfiker, Veronique Lugon-Moulin, and Andre Meichtry, and by intramural funds from the Berner Klinik Montana to Dr Claude Vaney, Brigitte Gattlen, and Rita Hausammann, and from University of Applied Sciences Western Switzerland, Institut Sante Social, to Roger Hilfiker.;;41;52;52;2;36;SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC;THOUSAND OAKS;2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA;1545-9683;1552-6844;;NEUROREHAB NEURAL RE;Neurorehabil.

Purpose: The present study examined the accuracy of the actibelt (R) accelerometer for measuring walking speed during a standard 6-min walk (6MW) and the possibility that disability status influenced the degree of accuracy among persons with MS. Methods: On a single testing session, 51 persons with MS and Expanded Disability Status Scale scores between 2.0 and 6.5 performed a 6MW while wearing an actibelt (R) in the body's sagittal symmetry plane and close to the body's centre of mass. Results: All 51 participants completed the 6MW without stopping, falling, or any adverse events, and the actibelt (R) provided walking speed data for each of the participants. The actibelt (R) significantly overestimated walking speed (actual minus actibelt (R)) by a mean standard deviation of -0.12 +/- 0.17 m/s for the overall sample (p < 0.0001). There was no significant overestimation in the sample with mild disability (-0.02 +/- 0.11 m/s), but there was in the samples with moderate (-0.10 +/- 0.16 m/s) and severe (-0.26 +/- 0.12 m/s) disability. Conclusion: The actibelt (R) is ready for real-life monitoring of walking speed in persons with mild MS, but caution is necessary when interpreting the accuracy of the walking speed data for those with MS who have moderate and severe disability.

Despite this, very little is known about the antecedents and consequences of self-esteem in persons with MS. Objectives: To examine (I) physical activity and social support as potentially modifiable correlates (i.e., antecedents) of self-esteem and (2) physical and psychological health-related quality of life as possible consequences of self-esteem in persons with MS. Methods: Participants (N = 46) wore an Actigraph accelerometer for 7 days and then completed a battery of questionnaires, including the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES), Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29), and Social Provisions Scale (SPS). The data were analyzed using PASW Statistics 18. Results: Bivariate correlation analysis indicated that average daily step counts (r = .298, p = .026) and social support (r = .366, p = .007) were significantly correlated with self-esteem. Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that only social support was a significant predictor of self-esteem scores (beta = .411, p = .004); pedometer steps approached significance as a predictor of self-esteem (beta = .178, p = .112). Bivariate correlation analysis further indicated significant negative associations between self-esteem and physical (r = -.391, p = .004) and psychological (r = -.540, p = .0001) domains of health-related quality of life (HRQOL), indicating that higher self-esteem was associated with more positive HRQOL.

Sports Exerc., Vol. 44, No. 2, pp. 238-243, 2012. Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disorder of the brain and spinal cord. Disability status and progression are associated with reduced physical activity (PA) and cardiovascular function. Lack of adequate PA combined with inflammation may create high susceptibility to subclinical atherosclerosis and vascular dysfunction. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to compare subclinical atherosclerosis and arterial function between individuals with and without MS matched for age, sex, and body mass index. Methods: Thirty-three individuals diagnosed with MS and 33 controls underwent strain gauge plethysmography for resting forearm blood flow (FBF) and peak reactive hyperemia for the microvascular function. Intima-media thickness and arterial compliance (AC) were measured using carotid ultrasound for vascular function. C-reactive protein and PA (7-d accelerometer data) were also measured. Results: There was a significant difference (P < 0.05) in resting FBF, peak reactive hyperemia, central pulse wave velocity, and AC between the MS and control groups. PA was associated with peak FBF and central pulse wave velocity but not FBF and carotid AC. Individuals with MS exhibit reduced arterial function but similar intima-media thickness compared with controls. Persons with MS had significantly reduced PA levels compared with controls, and PA accounted for differences in arterial function between groups. Conclusions: These results indicate that subclinical markers of atherosclerosis are higher in individuals with MS, suggesting a higher risk of cardiovascular disease in this population. However, the higher levels of subclinical atherosclerosis were accounted for by the low PA in persons with MS, suggesting that increasing PA may reduce the increase in cardiovascular disease risk in patients with MS.;"[Ranadive, Sushant M.; Yan, Huimin; Weikert, Madeline; Lane, Abbi D.; Linden, Mellissa A.; Baynard, Tracy; Motl, Robert W.; Fernhall, Bo] Univ Illinois, Dept Kinesiol & Community Hlth, Urbana, IL 61801 USA";Fernhall, B (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Kinesiol & Community Hlth, 227 Freer Hall MC 052,906 S Goodwin Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.;fernhall@illinois.edu;"Ranadive, Sushant/J-7601-2013; Linden, Melissa/P-3079-2017";"Yan, Huimin/0000-0003-0907-1246; Baynard, Tracy/0000-0002-5150-4095; Linden, Melissa/0000-0002-3152-0864";University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Research Board;This study was partially funded by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Research Board.;;45;37;37;0;7;LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS;PHILADELPHIA;530 WALNUT ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106-3621 USA;0195-9131;;;MED SCI SPORT EXER;Med.

This study examined the association between rates of activity counts and energy expenditure during walking by using two models of accelerometers and generated cut-points representing moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in persons with MS. Participants were 43 persons with MS and 43 controls who undertook 5 min of seated rest and up to five 6 min periods of walking at five different speeds on a treadmill. While walking, participants wore two models of accelerometers and a mouthpiece in-line with an open-circuit spirometry system for measuring energy expenditure (rate of oxygen consumption). Strong linear associations were found between accelerometer activity counts and energy expenditure, and the magnitude did not differ between MS and controls for both accelerometer models. The mean slopes of the linear relationships were steeper in persons with MS than controls and resulted in distinct cut-points for MVPA based on accelerometer counts for persons with MS and controls. The strong linear relationship between activity counts and energy expenditure and cut-points for quantifying time spent in MVPA should allow for better understanding of physical activity and examination of its predictors and consequences when using accelerometers in MS.;"[Sandroff, Brian M.; Motl, Robert W.; Suh, Yoojin] Univ Illinois, Dept Kinesiol & Community Hlth, Urbana, IL 61801 USA";Motl, RW (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Kinesiol & Community Hlth, 233 Freer Hall,906 South Goodwin Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.;robmotl@illinois.edu;;Sandroff, Brian/0000-0002-2013-7632;Foundation of the Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers;This material was based on work supported by the Foundation of the Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers.;;24;57;57;0;10;JOURNAL REHAB RES & DEV;BALTIMORE;DEPT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS REHABIL RES & DEVELOP CTR 103 SOUTH GAY STREET, BALTIMORE, MD 21202-4051 USA;0748-7711;1938-1352;;J REHABIL RES DEV;J.

However, the assumption that walking itself serves as a major contributor to the accelerometer signal has yet to be tested. This study examined the assumption that community-based walking is a primary contributor to accelerometer output in MS. Ambulatory persons (5 males/17 females; 13 without aid/9 with aid) with MS wore a triaxial accelerometer (ActiGraph GT3X, Health One Technologies; Fort Walton Beach, Florida) as well as an IDEEA system (MiniSun, Inc; Fresno, Florida) over the course of a single day. Outcome measures for the accelerometer included movement counts/hour for the vertical, anterior-posterior, and mediolateral axes. Outcomes for the LIDEEA system included percent time walking, sitting, and standing, as well as walking speed. Pearson product correlations (r) were used to examine the associations between outcomes from the accelerometer and IDEEA system. Significant correlations were observed between percent walking time and movement counts/hour along the vertical (r = 0.84) and anterior-posterior (r = 0.69) axes. Significant correlations were further noted between movement counts/hour along the vertical axis and walking speed (r = 0.45) and self-report walking impairment (r = -0.50) and disability (r = -0.46).

Materials and Methods: Visual and auditory feedback cues were generated by a wearable device, driven by inertial sensors. Ten randomly selected patients with gait disorders due to cerebral palsy and seven age-matched healthy individuals trained with visual feedback cues, while ten patients and eight age-matched healthy individuals trained with auditory feedback cues. Baseline performance (walking speed and stride length along a 10-m straight track) was measured before device use. Following 20-min training with the device and a 20-min break, performance without the devicewas measured again and compared with the baseline performance. Results: For the patients who trained with visual feedback, the average improvement was 21.70% +/- 36.06% in the walking speed and 8.72% +/- 9.47% in the stride length. For the patients who trained with auditory feedback, the average improvement was 25.43% +/- 28.65% in the walking speed and 13.58% +/- 13.10% in the stride length. For the healthy individuals who trained with visual feedback, the average improvement was -2.41% +/- 9.54% in the walking speed and -2.84% +/- 10.11% in the stride length. For the healthy individuals who trained with auditory feedback, the average improvement was 0.01% +/- 7.73% in the walking speed and -2.03% +/- 6.15% in the stride length. Conclusions: Training with visual and auditory feedback cues can improve gait parameters in patients with gait disorders due to cerebral palsy.

Material/Methods: The study included 49 consecutive patients with relapsing-remitting MS who received Solu-Medrol 1000 mg/day over 3 days for relapse with difficulties in walking. The following walking-based measures were administered before and a month after IVMP: the Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale-12 (MSWS-12), the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), the 2-minute timed walk (2-minTW), the 25-foot walk test (25FWT), the Six Spot Step Test (SSST). All patients had worn the step activity monitor accelerometer (SAM) 1 week prior to IVMP was applied and wore it again the fourth week upon the corticosteroid therapy was completed. The SAM analysis utilized the average daily step count and data regarding frequency and intensity of walking over a continuous time interval. We examined: (1) the impact of IVMP on the recovery of walking ability; (2) the responsiveness of each walking-based measure; (3) the relative responsiveness of competing walking-based measures; and (4) the impact of different walking-based measures responsiveness on clinical trials. Results: All walking-based measures showed significant improvement of walking ability 1 month after the IVMP. The most responsive were MSWS-12 and EDSS. Different responsiveness implied a greater than 6-fold impact on sample size estimates.

Inexpensive, unobtrusive wireless sensors, including accelerometers, gyroscopes, and pressure-sensitive textiles, combined with Internet-based communications and machine-learning algorithms trained to recognize upper-and lower-extremity movements, have begun to fulfill this need. Continuous data from ankle triaxial accelerometers, for example, can be transmitted from the home and community via WiFi or a smartphone to a remote data analysis server. Reports can include the walking speed and duration of every bout of ambulation, spatiotemporal symmetries between the legs, and the type, duration, and energy used during exercise. For daily care, this readily accessible flow of real-world information allows clinicians to monitor the amount and quality of exercise for risk factor management and compliance in the practice of skills. Feedback may motivate better self-management as well as serve home-based rehabilitation efforts. Monitoring patients with chronic diseases and after hospitalization or the start of new medications for a decline in daily activity may help detect medical complications before rehospitalization becomes necessary. For clinical trials, repeated laboratory-quality assessments of key activities in the community, rather than by clinic testing, self-report, and ordinal scales, may reduce the cost and burden of travel, improve recruitment and retention, and capture more reliable, valid, and responsive ratio-scaled outcome measures that are not mere surrogates for changes in daily impairment, disability, and functioning.;[Dobkin, Bruce H.] Geffen UCLA Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Los Angeles, CA USA;Dobkin, BH (corresponding author), Geffen UCLA Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Los Angeles, CA USA.;BDobkin@mednet.ucla.edu;;Dorsch, Andrew/0000-0001-8955-7742;"Richard Merkin Foundation for Neural Regeneration at UCLA; EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH & HUMAN DEVELOPMENTUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [R01HD071809, R01HD071809, R01HD071809] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER";The authors thank the Richard Merkin Foundation for Neural Regeneration at UCLA for funding.

The sensors were placed on anatomical segments of the lower limb: foot, shank, thigh, and hip, and the motion data were then captured in conjunction with 3D ground reaction forces (GRFs). The method of relational matrix was applied to develop a rule-based system, an intelligent fuzzy computational algorithm. The rule-based system provides a feature matrix model representing the strength of association or interaction amongst the elements of the gait functions (limb-segments accelerations and GRFs) throughout the gait cycle. A comparison between the reference rule-based data and an input test data was evaluated using a fuzzy similarity algorithm. This system was tested and evaluated using two subject groups: 10 healthy subjects were recruited to establish the reference fuzzy rule-base, and 4 relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis subjects were used as an input test data; and the grade of similarity between them was evaluated. This similarity provides a quantitative assessment of mobility state of the impaired subject. This algorithmic tool may be helpful to the clinician in the identification of pathological gait impairments, prescribe treatment, and assess the improvements in response to therapeutic intervention.

Objective: To evaluate the relationship of gait parameters, and demographic and physical characteristics in healthy men and women. Design, Setting, and Participants: Recruitment of a subsample (n = 358) of male and female blood donors taking part in the Cambridge CardioResource study. Collection of demographic data, measurement of physical characteristics (height, weight and blood pressure) and assessment of 7-day, free-living activity parameters using accelerometry and a novel algorithm to measure walking speed. Participants were a median (interquartile range[IQR]) age of 49 (16) years; 45% women; and had a median (IQR) BMI of 26 (5.4). Main Outcome Measure: Walking speed. Results: In this study, the hypothesis that walking speed declines with age was generated using an initial 'open' dataset. This was subsequently validated in a separate 'closed' dataset that showed a decrease of walking speed of -0.0037 m/s per year. This is equivalent to a difference of 1.2 minutes, when walking a distance of 1 km aged 20 compared to 60 years. Associations between walking speed and other participant characteristics (i.e. gender, BMI and blood pressure) were nonsignificant. BMI was negatively correlated with the number of walking and running steps and longest non-stop distance. Conclusion: This is the first study using accelerometry which shows an association between walking speed and age in free-living, healthy individuals. Absolute values of gait speed are comparable to published normal ranges in clinical settings. This study highlights the potential use of mobile accelerometry to assess gait parameters which may be indicative of future health outcomes in healthy individuals.";"[Schimpl, Michaela; Lederer, Christian; Neuhaus, Anneke; Daumer, Martin] Human Mot Inst, Sylvia Lawry Ctr Multiple Sclerosis Res eV, Munich, Germany; [Schimpl, Michaela; Daumer, Martin] Trium Anal Online GmbH, Munich, Germany; [Moore, Carmel; Danesh, John] Univ Cambridge, Dept Publ Hlth & Primary Care, Cambridge, England; [Sambrook, Jennifer; Ouwehand, Willem] Univ Cambridge, Dept Haematol, Cambridge, England; [Sambrook, Jennifer; Ouwehand, Willem] NHS Blood & Transplant, Cambridge, England";Schimpl, M (corresponding author), Human Mot Inst, Sylvia Lawry Ctr Multiple Sclerosis Res eV, Munich, Germany.;daumer@slcmsr.org;;Ouwehand, Willem/0000-0002-7744-1790;"German Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF)Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF) [01GI0920]; EUEuropean Commission [215820-2, FP7-223865, 215820, 223865, LSHM-CT-2006-03759, LSHM-CT-2004-503485]; UK Medical Research Council/Wellcome TrustUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)Wellcome Trust; Federal Ministry of Education and ResearchFederal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF) [01GI0920, 01GI0904]; Mayo Clinic Rochester; Federal Ministry of Economics and TechnologyFederal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) [KF0564001KF7]; University of Oxford; Technical University of Munich; Hertie Foundation [1.01.1/07/015]; Bavarian Research Foundation; National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS)National Multiple Sclerosis Society; Porticus Foundation [900.50578]; University of Rochester; GlaxoSmithKlineGlaxoSmithKline; MerckMerck & Company; NovartisNovartis; PfizerPfizer; British Heart FoundationBritish Heart Foundation [RG/08/014/24067, RG/09/012/28096] Funding Source: researchfish; Medical Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC) [MC_qA137933] Funding Source: researchfish; National Institute for Health ResearchNational Institute for Health Research (NIHR) [RP-PG-0310-1004] Funding Source: researchfish";"This work was partly supported by grants from the German Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF, German Competence Network Multiple Sclerosis (KKNMS), 01GI0920), EU FP7 (NETSIM (215820-2) and VPHOP (FP7-223865)).

In a clinical setting, walking speed is typically measured by means of walking tests using different protocols. However, walking speed obtained in this way is unlikely to be representative of the conditions in a free-living environment. Recently, mobile accelerometry has opened up the possibility to extract walking speed from long-time observations in free-living individuals, but the validity of these measurements needs to be determined. In this investigation, we have developed algorithms for walking speed prediction based on 3D accelerometry data (actibelt (R)) and created a framework using a standardized data set with gold standard annotations to facilitate the validation and comparison of these algorithms. For this purpose 17 healthy subjects operated a newly developed mobile gold standard while walking/running on an indoor track. Subsequently, the validity of 12 candidate algorithms for walking speed prediction ranging from well-known simple approaches like combining step length with frequency to more sophisticated algorithms such as linear and non-linear models was assessed using statistical measures. As a result, a novel algorithm employing support vector regression was found to perform best with a concordance correlation coefficient of 0.93 (95% CI 0.92-0.94) and a coverage probability CP1 of 0.46 (95% CI 0.12-0.70) for a deviation of 0.1 m/s (CP2 0.78, CP3 0.94) when compared to the mobile gold standard while walking indoors.

This observation has prompted the search for modifiable constructs derived from established theories that act as correlates of physical activity. This study investigated self efficacy, outcome expectations, impediments, and goal setting as correlates of physical activity in inactive persons with MS. Participants (n = 54) completed a battery of measures as part of baseline data collection from an ongoing Internet intervention for increasing physical activity in inactive persons with MS. Bivariate correlation analysis indicated that physical activity was significantly correlated with outcome expectations (r = 0.29), functional limitations (r = 0.28), and goal setting (r = 0.31), but not self efficacy (r = 0.13). Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that only goal setting was significantly associated with physical activity (beta = 0.31).

Objective: There is currently no published evidence from longitudinal or intervention studies of an association between lifestyle physical activity and walking impairment in persons with multiple sclerosis. This panel study tested the hypothesis that a change in lifestyle physical activity would be inversely associated with change in walking impairment over a 6-mo period in persons with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Design: Participants with a confirmed diagnosis of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis completed a battery of measures at baseline (n = 269) and at 6-mo follow-up (n = 263) in the absence of an intervention. The data were analyzed using linear panel analysis and covariance modeling in Mplus 3.0. Results: The panel model fit the data (chi(2) = 25.23; df = 12; P = 0.01; standardized root-mean-squared residual, 0.04; comparative fit index, 0.98) and, as expected, identified the direct effects between baseline physical activity and walking impairment (path coefficient, -0.31) and follow-up physical activity and walking impairment (path coefficient, -0.16). The second path coefficient indicated that a standard deviation unit change of 1 in physical activity was associated with a standard deviation unit residual change of 0.16 in walking impairment.

Using the example of multiple sclerosis (MS), this work presents the current utilities and potentials of accelerometers for the diagnosis of and therapy for chronic diseases. By measuring the daily activity of MS patients, accelerometers could help us to observe the course of the disease more objectively. With the measured data, indicators like active speed  can be gained to objectify the patient's disease status at home. In this study over a period of 2 years, patients with MS wore accelerometers, embedded in the buckle of a belt. The results of the study show that patients were willing to wear the accelerometer devices and that the obtained data reveal differences between healthy people and patients with MS.

Intention tremor is a complex movement disorder that worsens during goal directed movements and can therefore be extremely disabling. Multiple inertial measurement unit devices were used to measure the upper limb of subjects with multiple sclerosis and intention tremor during standard clinical finger-to-nose tests and reach-retrieve tasks, which were designed to mimic activities of daily living. Analyses allowed information on tremor characteristics to be ascertained during these movements. The equipment and software provide a useful tool for clinical assessment of tremor, displaying a variety of relevant information at differing levels of detail, obtainable at several points over the torso, shoulder, upper arm, lower arm and hand. Examples of this data are discussed. The system allows tremor assessment in more detail than is possible with clinical tests that rely on visual assessments, and provides a tool that can accurately assess the benefits of future tremor reduction devices, or other interventions.;"[Ketteringham, Laurence P.; Neild, Simon A.; Hyde, Richard A.] Univ Bristol, Dept Mech Engn, Queens Bldg,Univ Walk, Bristol BS8 1TR, Avon, England; [Jones, Rosemary J.

To that end, the current study adopted a panel design and analysis for examining hypothesized relationships among changes in social cognitive variables and physical activity over time in persons with MS, and this is necessary for designing effective behavioral interventions. On two occasions separated by an 18-month period, persons (N = 218) with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), who were initially recruited by telephone for a cross-sectional study, completed a battery of questionnaires that assessed social cognitive variables and physical activity. Those study materials were delivered and returned via the United State Postal Service. The 18-month changes in self-efficacy (path coefficient = .25, p < .01) and goal setting (path coefficient = .26, p < .01) had direct effects on residual change in physical activity. The change in self-efficacy further had an indirect effect on residual change in physical activity that was accounted for by change in goal setting (path coefficient = .05, p < .05). This longitudinal study suggests that self-efficacy and goal setting represent plausible targets for changing physical activity behavior in persons with RRMS.;[Suh, Yoojin] Univ Illinois, Dept Kinesiol & Community Hlth, Urbana, IL 61801 USA;Suh, Y (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Kinesiol & Community Hlth, 253 Freer Hall, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.;yoosuh@illinois.edu;;;;;;39;26;26;0;13;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0896-4289;1940-4026;;BEHAV MED;Behav.

Thirty physically active women (mean +/- SD; 21.7 +/- 1.67 years) were randomized in three groups. The first group performed on the platform with 15, 45 and 90 degrees knee flexions, the second group with 45, 90, 15 degrees, and the third group with 90, 15, 45 degrees. The WBV frequency was 12.6 Hz. The acceleration was recorded by a tri-axial accelerometer (Biopac) attached on the skin at L3 level and the electromyography (EMG) was recorded by surface active electrodes (Biopac) on the extensors and flexors of the knee and lower trunk. The lateral acceleration was 3 times greater (p < 0.05) at the vertical line in 3 angles of flexion, and the vertical line was 2 times greater (p < 0.05). Maximum accelerations: lateral (11-13 g) and vertical line (6-7 g) had increased when reducing the knee-flexion angles. In conclusion, WBV using the Galileo platform transmits more lateral neuromuscular and mechanical stimuli than vertical stimuli. A smaller degree of knee flexion transmits a greater mechanical stimulus, and a higher flexion of the knees implies an increase of muscular activity in the vastus internus muscle. These findings open the possibility of different applications.";"[Gusi, N.; Parraca, J. A.; Adsuar, J. C.; Olivares, P.

Methods: Fifteen people with MS and 14 matched controls (mean +/- SD age and body mass index 53 center dot 7 +/- 10 center dot 5 versus 54 center dot 6 +/- 9 center dot 6 years and 27 center dot 7 +/- 6 center dot 1 versus 26 center dot 5 +/- 4, respectively) completed 20%, 40%, 60% and 80% of their maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) of the knee extensors. sEMG was recorded from the vastus lateralis where muscle fibre conduction velocity (MFCV) and sEMG amplitude (RMS) were assessed.

Results: People with MS showed significantly (P < 0 center dot 05) faster MFCV during MVC (6 center dot 6 +/- 2 center dot 7 versus 4 center dot 7 +/- 1 center dot 4 m s-1) and all submaximal contractions, while RMS was significantly (P < 0 center dot 05) less (0 center dot 11 +/- 0 center dot 03 versus 0 center dot 24 +/- 0 center dot 06 mV) in comparison with the controls. MVC along with specific thigh lean mass to torque, rate of force development and mean physical activity were significantly (P < 0 center dot 01) less in PwMS.

Advances in technology have resulted in an increased number of motion sensors such as pedometers and accelerometers that are worn on the body and that measure bodily movement. Accelerometers are becoming less expensive and more user-friendly, but there is limited evidence regarding the accuracy of measurement in persons with MS. Objective: The present study examined the accuracy of an ActiGraph accelerometer for measuring steps taken during controlled conditions in persons with MS compared with a sample of individuals without MS. Methods: The participants were 24 adults with mild MS and 24 adults without MS who undertook three 6-minute periods of walking at 54, 80, and 107 m.min(-1) on a motor-driven treadmill. We measured steps taken through observation and an ActiGraph model 7164 accelerometer worn around the waist above the right hip. Results: The accelerometer accurately measured steps during moderate (80 m.min(-1)) and fast (107 m.min(-1)) walking in both persons with MS and control subjects. There was a small degree of underestimation of step counts (approximate to 4% error) for the accelerometer during slower walking (54 m.min(-1)) in both persons with MS and control subjects. Conclusions: Such findings support the accuracy of a waist worn ActiGraph accelerometer for the measurement of steps in persons with MS and control subjects. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Often, though, voluntary activation of an emergency call (by pressing a help button, or activating any kind of AT communication device) can be quite demanding for people with debilitating diseases or severe motion impairments (besides, of course, depending on patient's consciousness). Modern ICTs can provide much help, enabling automatic recognition of help needs and management of emergency calls. Although very different in nature, this task has many technical similarities with environmental safety and security control carried out by an Ambient-Assisted Living system, which, in turn, can be also quite useful in allowing bedridden patients to control the home environment. Hence, embedding health-monitoring features within a general-purpose AAL framework may result in a more flexible, reliable and cost-effective solution. This work aims at describing design and implementation of such a solution in a live context: the CARDEA AAL system was deployed at 'Casa Scarzara', a sheltered house for people with multiple sclerosis in Parma, embedding wireless sensors for vital-sign monitoring. Main Content A wireless wearable sensor has been used, which allows for acquiring 3 physiological parameters (2-channel ECG, temperature, and breathing). The sensor is worn at patient's chest, and wirelessly communicates with a PC (base-station), through a Bluetooth connection. The base-station then processes the incoming data stream, extracting the hearth and breathing rates; if such rates (or body temperature) exceed given ranges, the processor issue a request to CARDEA, through a standard LAN connection. From this phase on, CARDEA manages the emergency call, warning a human attendant, by means of visual or acoustic signals, or activating a local pager. If no one takes care of the alert within a few minutes, emergency phone calls and SMS are generated automatically by the CARDEA system. Results Before deployment, the system has undergone extensive testing at TAU labs, with positive results. Field-testing at 'Casa Scarzara' is starting (February 2011). We expect the proposed solution can help to increase protection of a bedridden person, by providing continuous local and possibly remote supervision.";"[Matrella, Guido; Grossi, Ferdinando; Losardo, Agostino] Univ Parma, Ctr TAU, I-43100 Parma, Italy";Matrella, G (corresponding author), Univ Parma, Dipartimento Ingn Informaz, Ctr Collaboraz Tecnol Assist, Viale GP Usberti 181-A, I-43124 Parma, Italy.;guido.matrella@unipr.it;Matrella, Guido/Q-3272-2016;"Matrella, Guido/0000-0002-0705-527X; Grossi, Ferdinando/0000-0003-1693-0977; Losardo, Agostino/0000-0002-9108-9703";Fondazione CARIPARMAFondazione Cariparma;The authors gratefully acknowledge donations coming from OCME employees, Parma, as well as collaboration from AISM and financial support from Fondazione CARIPARMA.;;6;1;1;0;1;IOS PRESS;AMSTERDAM;NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;1383-813X;;"978-1-60750-814-4; 978-1-60750-813-7";ASSIST TECHNOL RES S;;;2011;29;;;;;;81;87;;10.3233/978-1-60750-814-4-81;;;7;Rehabilitation;Rehabilitation;BG9NW;WOS:000393465400011;;;;;2021-03-18;

Self-report questionnaires rely on the participant's cognitive function and reporting accuracy, while the association between clinical timed walk tests and community ambulation may not be strong. Progress toward the identification of an appropriate clinical tool to measure strides in PD and MS populations is hampered by the lack of meaningful research and reference standards in this area. Purpose: The objective of the present study was to explore the validity of the StepWatch Step Activity Monitor (SAM) in assessing stride count in persons with PD or MS. The SAM is a 2-dimensional accelerometer that counts strides and is calibrated for individual participants. Methods: A convenience sample of 20 participants completed a health history interview. Participants ambulated approximately 15 m while wearing the SAM to establish appropriate baseline calibrations, matching their stride with the device settings. Next, participants took 3 passes over the GaitMat II (GM II) while wearing the SAM. Strides counted by the GM were compared with the strides counted by the SAM. Results: The Pearson correlation coefficients (r) for MS and PD, respectively, were 0.99 and 1.0. Conclusions: Our investigation presents preliminary data that shows the concurrent validity of the SAM when compared with the gold standard GM. The SAM appears to be a valid tool for use in persons with PD and MS.

The large quantities of acquired kinetic, kinematic and electromyographic data are dealt with as aggregate information granules, enabling an efficient partition of input space and more rapid analysis. The process of data aggregation or granulation is predicted on an understanding and application of the functional relationships of human movement and are expressed in an implication table. This implication table is the basis of a fuzzy relational matrix, a feature pattern, established between the dynamic activities during locomotion.

Methods: The sample included 561 persons with MS who completed demographic, cardiovascular comorbidity, disability status, and physical activity self-report assessments, and then wore an accelerometer for 7 days. The data were analyzed using bivariate correlation and multiple linear regression analyses. Results: Bivariate correlation analysis indicated that there were statistically significant, inverse associations between the number of self-reported cardiovascular comorbidities and objectively measured (r = -0.192, p = 0.0001) and self-reported (r = -0.151, p = 0.0001) physical activity. The first multiple linear regression indicated that objectively measured physical activity was significantly associated with the number of self-reported cardiovascular comorbidities (B = -0.003, SE B = 0.001, beta = -0.128), even after controlling for confounding variables. The second multiple linear regression indicated that self-reported physical activity, too, was significantly associated with the number of self-reported cardiovascular comorbidities (B = -0.011, SE B = 0.004, beta = -0.114), even after controlling for confounding variables. Conclusion: Physical activity was associated with the number of self-reported cardiovascular comorbidities, independent of disability status and other possible confounding variables, in persons with MS.

This study tested the assumption that a waist-worn accelerometer should capture the intra- and inter-person variation in walking behavior. Twenty-four participants with a neurologist-confirmed diagnosis of MS and who were ambulatory with minimal assistance undertook three 6-min periods of over-ground walking that involved comfortable (CWS) and then slower (SWS) and faster (RA'S) walking speeds while wearing ActiGraph, model 7164, accelerometers around the waist and ankle. The experimental manipulation of walking was successful such that the CWS was 76.7 +/- 13.0 m/min (range = 55.6-105.14), whereas the SWS and FWS were 64.3 +/- 12.3 m/min (range = 44.5-90.1) and 89.1 +/- 13.8 m/min (range = 60.9-116.4), respectively. Movement counts from the waist and ankle-worn accelerometer were strongly associated with the manipulation of speed, but the association was stronger for the waist than ankle based on both eta-squared estimates (eta(2) values = .78 and .46) and the average squared multiple correlations from individual regression analyses (R-2 values = .97 +/- .04 and .88 +/- .21). The bivariate correlation between movement counts from the waist-worn accelerometer and speed of walking (r = .823, p = .001) was large in magnitude and significantly different (z = 3.22, p = .001) from that between movement counts from the ankle-worn unit and walking speed (r = .549, p = .001). This study provides novel evidence that an accelerometer worn around the waist captures intra- and inter-person variation in over-ground walking behavior in those with MS. (C) 2010 IPEM.

Design: Cross-sectional comparison. Subjects: Eighteen adults with multiple sclerosis and 18 adults without multiple sclerosis. Methods: VO(2) was measured at rest and during treadmill walking at 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0 mph with open-circuit spirometry. The actual VO(2) was compared with that estimated by both the American College of Sports Medicine and the van der Walt and Wyndham equations. Results: The differences between the actual VO(2) and that estimated by both equations were significantly higher than zero across speeds for both groups (p < 0.001). The underestimation increased with increasing speed (p < 0.001) for both groups and was greater for participants with multiple sclerosis than those without multiple sclerosis (p < 0.011). The inaccurate prediction by the American College of Sports Medicine formula was associated with an underestimation of the net VO(2) per meter (p < 0.001), and this was higher for participants with multiple sclerosis (p < 0.007). Conclusion: Rehabilitation and exercise professionals should recognize that the American College of Sports Medicine and the van der Walt and Wyndham equations underestimate VO(2) during treadmill walking in individuals with and without multiple sclerosis.;"[Agiovlasitis, Stamatis] Mississippi State Univ, Dept Kinesiol, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA; [Motl, Robert W.; Fernhall, Bo] Univ Illinois, Dept Kinesiol & Community Hlth, Champaign, IL USA";Agiovlasitis, S (corresponding author), Mississippi State Univ, Dept Kinesiol, 233 McCarthy Gym,POB 6186, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA.;sagiovlasitis@colled.msstate.edu;;;;;;24;9;9;0;8;FOUNDATION REHABILITATION INFORMATION;UPPSALA;TRADGARDSGATAN 14, UPPSALA, SE-753 09, SWEDEN;1650-1977;;;J REHABIL MED;J.

We examined total movement counts and three novel methods of processing accelerometer data (i.e. standard deviation, approximate entropy and detrended fluctuation analysis) for quantifying real-life walking impairment in this population. A total of 70 individuals with a definite diagnosis of multiple sclerosis completed a battery of patient-rated measures of walking impairment and then wore an ActiGraph accelerometer for 7 days. The data were analyzed using multivariate analysis of variance and bivariate correlation analysis. The results indicated that total daily movement counts and standard deviation of daily movement counts differed between groups of persons with mild, moderate, and severe self-reported disability status and who were independently ambulatory or ambulatory with assistance. Those two metrics for the accelerometer data further demonstrated strong correlations with patient-rated measures of walking impairment. By comparison, there were smaller and often non-significant differences in approximate entropy and detrended fluctuation analysis metrics for the accelerometer data as a function of disability and ambulatory status, and only moderate correlations with patient-rated measures of walking impairment. The results confirm that the metric of total daily movement counts correlates with level of disability, ambulatory status, and patient reports of walking impairment in persons with multiple sclerosis. We further demonstrate that variability, indexed by the standard deviation of daily movement counts, correlates with multiple sclerosis-related disability, ambulatory status, and self-reported walking impairment. Such results provide preliminary evidence that variability in accelerometer counts is not simply noise and may provide important information about multiple sclerosis-related walking impairment.;"[Sosnoff, Jacob J.; Motl, Robert W.] Univ Illinois, Dept Kinesiol & Community Hlth, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Goldman, Myla D.] Univ Virginia, Dept Neurol, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA";Motl, RW (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Kinesiol & Community Hlth, 350 Freer Hall,906 S Goodwin Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.;robmotl@uiuc.edu;"Goldman, Myla/AAG-8737-2020; Sosnoff, Jacob/P-3397-2019; Goldman, Myla D/D-1955-2017";"Goldman, Myla/0000-0002-5675-945X; Sosnoff, Jacob/0000-0002-0286-9207; ";"NINDS NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS) [K23 NS062898] Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS) [K23NS062898, K23NS062898, K23NS062898, K23NS062898, K23NS062898] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER";;;38;30;31;0;4;SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD;LONDON;1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND;1352-4585;;;MULT SCLER J;Mult.

Fifty persons with multiple sclerosis (Expanded Disability Status Scale, EDSS, 1.5-6.5) were tested on leg muscle strength as well as walking and balance capacity, and completed self-report indices on perceived physical functioning. Habitual walking performance, that is, the real amount of steps that is performed in the customary living environment, was registered by means of an ambulant accelerometer-based monitor during seven consecutive days. Mild (EDSS 1.5-4.0, n=29) and moderate (EDSS 4.5-6.5, n=21) multiple sclerosis subgroups were additionally distinguished as predictor variables and values were hypothesized to differ depending on multiple sclerosis severity and concomitant ambulatory function. Multiple regression analyses yielded a single most significant predictor for each (sub) group with other variables making no independent contribution to the variation in habitual walking performance. For the total study sample, this was the 6-Minute Walking Test (R-2=0.458, p<0.01). In the mild multiple sclerosis subgroup, the 6-Minute Walking Test was again most predictive, yet to a modest degree (R-2=0.187, p=0.02). In the moderate multiple sclerosis subgroup, the 2-Minute Walking Test explained over half of the variance (R-2=0.532, p<0.01). Habitual walking performance is best reflected by longer walking capacity tests. The extent to which it can be predicted based on clinical testing is larger in a multiple sclerosis patient sample with more severe walking disability. Ambulatory monitoring, however, includes aspects of community ambulation not captured in the clinic, and must be considered as an additional outcome for evaluating interventions in multiple sclerosis.;"[Gijbels, Domien; Broekmans, Tom; 't Eijnde, Bert Op; Feys, Peter] Hasselt Univ, BIOMED Biomed Res Inst, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium; [Van Hoof, Elke] Hasselt Univ, SEIN Inst Social & Psychol Sci, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium; [Gijbels, Domien; Alders, Geert; Charlier, Caroline; Roelants, Machteld; Broekmans, Tom; 't Eijnde, Bert Op; Feys, Peter] PHL Univ Coll, REVAL Rehabil & Hlth Care Res Ctr, Hasselt, Belgium";Gijbels, D (corresponding author), Hasselt Univ, BIOMED Biomed Res Inst, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium.;domien.gijbels@uhasselt.be;;Feys, Peter/0000-0002-5680-5495;"Research Foundation Flanders (FWO)FWO; Belgian Charcot Foundation [2006]";DG is recipient of a fellowship from the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO).

We hypothesized that physical activity might be a correlate of anxiety and depression in early MS and that this association might be indirect and accounted for by disability. Methods: The sample included 96 individuals with a mean duration of MS of 3.0 years (SD = 1.5, range = 0.5-5 years). The participants wore an accelerometer for 7 days as an objective measure of physical activity and then completed the Patient Determined Disease Steps (PDDS) scale and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Results: Descriptive analysis indicated that 41% and 43% of the sample had elevated levels of anxiety and depression, respectively, based on HADS scores (i.e., score >= 8). Correlation analysis indicated that physical activity was significantly associated with depression (r = -0.25; rho = -.23), but not anxiety (r = -0.05; rho = -.02). Path analysis indicated that the association between physical activity and depression was entirely indirect by way of disability (path coefficient = -0.23). Conclusions: Such results suggest that physical activity could be an important health promoting behavior for reducing depression in the early stages of MS and this should be the focus of subsequent randomized controlled clinical trials.

This study examined the hypothesis that accelerometer movement counts represent a measure of both physical activity and walking mobility in individuals with MS. Methods: The sample included 269 individuals with a definite diagnosis of relapsing-remitting MS who completed the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ), International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale-12 (MSWS-12), Patient Determined Disease Steps (PDDS), and then wore an ActiGraph accelerometer for 7days. The data were analyzed using bivariate correlation and confirmatory factor analysis. Results: The results indicated that (a) the GLTEQ and IPAQ scores were strongly correlated and loaded significantly on a physical activity latent variable, (b) the MSWS-12 and PDDS scores strongly correlated and loaded significantly on a walking mobility latent variable, and (c) the accelerometer movement counts correlated similarly with the scores from the four self-report questionnaires and cross-loaded on both physical activity and walking mobility latent variables. Conclusion: Our data suggest that accelerometers are measuring both physical activity and walking mobility in persons with MS, whereas self-report instruments are measuring either physical activity or walking mobility in this population.

While the limitations of self-report measures are clearly acknowledged, less apparent is attention to the potential limitations of their 'objective' counterparts leading to the assumption that objectivity results in more robust and scientifically valid measurement tools. This article aims to: (1) test this assumption; (2) consider the implications of advocating for a measure on the basis of its objectivity; (3) propose an alternative approach to measure selection. Key findings and implications. A critical evaluation of one 'objective' measure highlights a number of potential limitations suggesting that the apparent willingness to adopt 'objective' measures with little questioning may be misguided. The possible implications of this are discussed and include a risk to the advancement of, and capacity for, knowledge in rehabilitation; or worse, of making clinical decisions based on erroneous conclusions. Conclusions. Characterising a measure on the basis of objectivity (or not) assumes an overly simplistic dichotomy that is unhelpful and perhaps misleading. We argue that assessing whether a measure is fit for purpose and makes mathematical sense is the key consideration. Indeed, in some cases, using both an 'objective' measure and a subjective rating scale may be appropriate and the only way of truly capturing the phenomenon of interest.";"[Kayes, Nicola M.; McPherson, Kathryn M.] AUT Univ, Hlth & Rehabil Res Inst, Auckland 1142, New Zealand";Kayes, NM (corresponding author), AUT Univ, Hlth & Rehabil Inst, Private Bag 92006, Auckland 1142, New Zealand.;nkayes@aut.ac.nz;;"McPherson, Kath/0000-0003-0487-8497; McPherson, Kathryn/0000-0003-1240-8882";;;;53;27;28;0;6;TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0963-8288;1464-5165;;DISABIL REHABIL;Disabil.

Various outcome measures, including relapses, disability and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures have been used to demonstrate the efficacy of the different available therapies for Multiple sclerosis. Recently, the potential limitations of these measures have received increasing attention, and these have stimulated research into more appropriate and sensitive outcome measures for clinical trials. For example, it has been shown that widely-used MRI measures add little, if any, independent information to that provided by more clinically relevant measures such as relapses and disability. Similarly, the Expanded Disability status Scale (EDSS), which is the most widely-used measure of disability related to multiple sclerosis, is insufficiently sensitive to detect robust changes in disability over the timeframes usually used in clinical trials. An alternative to the EDSS is the Multiple Sclerosis Severity Score (MSSS), a severity scale which relates clinical disability to disease duration. The MSSS was originally developed from a database of nearly ten thousand patients from eleven European countries and Australia and has since been reproduced in an independent dataset of 1134 patients from the placebo arms of randomised clinical trials. Based on the MSSS score, disease severity can be defined, which shows stability over time and may provide evidence-based decision support for patient management. Another alternative to measure disability is the objective quantification of physical activity. There is evidence that recent developments in pervasive computing using tiny accelerometers may have the potential to increase the reliability and precision of motor assessment, especially in the mid-range of the EDSS. The outcome measures discussed have potential use as online tools for evidence-based decision support which are increasingly being used in medical research and clinical decision-making.

Design and Main Outcome Measures: Adults with a definite diagnosis of MS wore an accelerometer for 7 days and then completed a battery of questionnaires at baseline (n = 292) and 6-months follow-up (n = 276). The data were analyzed using panel analysis and covariance modeling in Mplus 3.0. Results: The initial analysis indicated that change in physical activity was associated with a statistically significant and small residual change in QOL (beta = .07). The subsequent analysis indicated that change in physical activity was associated with residual changes in fatigue (gamma = -.17), pain (gamma = -.13), social support (gamma = .07), and self-efficacy (gamma =. 11), and, in turn, changes in fatigue (beta = -.13), pain (beta = -.09), social support (beta = .18), and self-efficacy (beta = .10) were associated with a residual change in QOL.

Overexpression of IL-12 has been correlated to the diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). An immunosensor has been fabricated by electroplating gold onto a disposable printed circuit board (PCB) electrode and immobilizing anti-IL-12 monoclonal antibodies (MAb) onto the surface of the electrode. This approach yields a robust sensor that facilitates reproducible mass fabrication and easy alteration of the electrode shape. Results indicate that this novel PCB sensor can detect IL-12 at physiological levels, <100 fM with f-values of 0.05 (typically <0.0001) in a label-free and rapid manner. A linear (with respect to log concentration) detectable range was achieved. Detection in a complex biological solution is also explored; however, significant loss of dynamic range is noted in the 100% complex solution. The cost effective approach described here can be used potentially for diagnosis of diseases (like MS) with known biomarkers in body fluids and for monitoring physiological levels of biomolecules with healthcare, food, and environmental relevance.

Methods: The sample included 133 individuals with MS who completed the SI-L, Performance Scales (PS), EDSS, Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale-12 (MSWS-12), Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale-29 (MSIS-29), and Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ) and then wore an accelerometer for 7 days. The data were analyzed using SPSS, version 16.0. Results: There were large correlations between SI-S and SI-L total and subscale scores and between SI-S, SI-L, and PS total scores. The correlations were similar in magnitude between SI-S, SI-L, and PS scores with EDSS and MSIS-29 scores, but not with MSWS-12, accelerometer, and GLTEQ scores. Discriminant function analysis indicated that SI-S scores better differentiated groups with minimal, moderate, and severe disability than did SI-L and PS scores. Regression analysis indicated that SI-S and SI-L scores explained incrementally more variance in EDSS, MSWS-12, and MSIS-29 scores after accounting for PS scores alone. Conclusion: Such findings provide additional support for the validity of both SI-S and SI-L scores in individuals with MS and support the adoption of either the SI-S or SI-L by clinical MS researchers.

Interventions: The participants undertook three 6-minute periods of walking at 3.2, 4.8, and 6.4km.h(-1) on a motor-driven treadmill. Main Outcome Measures: Activity counts and energy expenditure were measured with an accelerometer worn on the right hip and open-circuit spirometry, respectively. Results: The results indicated that (1) persons with MS had greater energy expenditure, but not activity counts, during walking on a treadmill than did controls; (2) there was a strong linear relationship between activity counts and energy expenditure during treadmill walking, but the slope of the relationship was steeper in persons with MS than in controls; and (3) the cut-points for light, moderate, and vigorous physical activity were lower in persons with MS than in controls.

One method for increasing physical activity levels involves the identification of factors that correlate with physical activity and that are modifiable by a well designed intervention. This study examined two types of self-efficacy as cross-sectional and prospective correlates of objectively measured physical activity in 16 individuals with a diagnosis of MS. The participants completed two measures of self-efficacy and then wore an accelerometer for a 5-day period at baseline and then at 3 months follow-up. Self-efficacy for continued physical activity was associated with baseline and follow-up levels of physical activity. Self-efficacy for overcoming barriers was associated with follow-up levels of physical activity and change in physical activity across a 3-month period. Researchers should consider self-efficacy as a possible component of an intervention that is designed to increase physical activity levels in those with MS.

Objective: To assess the feasibility, acceptability, and psychometric properties of Actical accelerometers in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). Design: Participants attended 2 testing sessions 7 days apart in which they completed 6 activities ranging in intensity while wearing an Actical accelerometer and Polar heart rate monitor. Perceived exertion was recorded after each activity. Setting: University research center. Participants: People (N=31) with a definite diagnosis of NIS were purposefully selected, aiming for diversity in level of reported disability, age, sex, and type of MS. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Actical accelerometer, Polar S810i and RS800sd heart rate monitors, Borg rating of perceived exertion, six-minute walk test (6MWT), 30-second chair stand test. Results: Accelerometers had good feasibility and acceptability in people with MS. Test-retest reliability was poor for sedentary and free-living activities, with low to moderate intra-class correlation coefficients (.00-75), but was better for more vigorous or rhythmic activities (.85-90). Bland-Altman 95% limits of agreement for average accelerometer counts were wide, ranging from +/- 16 (newspaper reading) to +/- 1330 (6MWT). Validity was not established with 95% prediction intervals showing high variability for all activities.

Subsequently, closed-loop virtual reality was used to enhance the gait improvement effect of such cues. Objectives: To study the effects of gait training with visual and auditory feedback cues on the walking abilities of patients with gait disorders due to cerebral palsy. Methods: Visual and auditory feedback cues were generated by a wearable accelerometry-driven device. Ten randomly selected patients with gait disorders due to cerebral palsy trained with visual feedback cues while ten such patients trained with auditory feedback cues. Baseline performance (walking speed and stride length along a 10m straight track) was measured before device use. Following 20min training with the device, performance without the device was measured again and compared to the baseline performance. Results: For patients training with visual feedback, the average improvement in walking speed was 21.70%+/-36.06% and in stride length 8.72%+/-9.47%. For patients training with auditory feedback, average improvement in walking speed was 25.43%+/-28.65% and in stride length 13.58%+/-13.10%.

It is suggested that the cerebrospinal fluid levels of the enzyme, free or bound to amyloid beta peptides, are a potential specific biomarker of Alzheimer disease. However, mitochondrial dysfunction seems to play a role in many neurological diseases including multiple sclerosis. In this study, the specificity of changes in relation to the enzyme over-expression was evaluated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent and surface plasmon resonance sensors. The data indicated pronounced increases in the enzyme levels, specifically to 179% in multiple sclerosis and to 573% in Alzheimer disease when compared to the age-matched controls. Although the differences between both diseases were statistically significant, enzyme levels do not appear to be a highly specific biomarker of Alzheimer disease. On the other hand, enhancement in levels of the enzyme bound to amyloid beta peptides was only observed in people with Alzheimer disease, which suggests that the complex should be further considered as a possible biomarker. In patients with multiple sclerosis, our results are the first to demonstrate significant changes in enzyme expression and to suggest possible alterations in amyloid beta peptides.;"[Kristofikova, Zdena; Bartos, Ales; Klaschka, Jan; Ricny, Jan; Ripova, Daniela] Prague Psychiat Ctr, Alzheimer Dis Ctr, Prague 18103 8, Bohnice, Czech Republic; [Bockova, Marketa; Hegnerova, Katerina; Homola, Jiri] Inst Photon & Elect, Prague 18251 8, Czech Republic";Kristofikova, Z (corresponding author), Prague Psychiat Ctr, Alzheimer Dis Ctr, Ustavni 91, Prague 18103 8, Bohnice, Czech Republic.;kristofikova@pcp.lf3.cuni.cz;"Bartos, Ales/C-4353-2019; Ricny, Jan/V-1662-2018; Klaschka, Jan/A-6076-2014; Homola, Jiri/F-3683-2014";"Bartos, Ales/0000-0002-8020-8252; Ricny, Jan/0000-0003-2625-057X; Klaschka, Jan/0000-0001-5923-5224; Homola, Jiri/0000-0001-6258-015X";IGA MHCR [NR/9322-3];The authors thank J.

It discusses systems for measuring and modelling upper limb movements and intention tremor, together with initial movement measurement and torque modelling data. The system uses microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) sensors to measure movements of the upper limb representative of everyday tasks. Surface electromyogram (EMG) measurements are taken simultaneously to provide gross muscle activity data. A dynamic model is used to simulate the movements, allowing particular sites to be studied in detail. Initial movement data is presented, comparing analysed EMG data and torque estimated by the dynamic model around the elbow joint. Despite the simple analysis, a good fit was obtained. The dynamic model includes a neuromuscular modelling system which will be used in future work to simulate the interactions between measured movements containing intention tremor and the intention behind them, allowing better understanding of the tremor and creating better descriptions of the tremor. Future work will use measured data and modelling to develop methods of attenuating intention tremor, by providing real-time feedback control of tremor reduction devices, without adversely affecting the underlying intended movement.;"[Ketteringham, Laurence P.; Neild, Simon A.; Hyde, Rick A.] Univ Bristol, Dept Mech Engn, Bristol BS8 1TR, Avon, England";Ketteringham, LP (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Dept Mech Engn, Queens Bldg,Univ Walk, Bristol BS8 1TR, Avon, England.;"l.ketteringham@bristol.ac.uk; simon.neild@bristol.ac.uk";;Neild, Simon/0000-0003-4122-4513;;;;14;0;0;0;3;AMER SOC MECHANICAL ENGINEERS;NEW YORK;THREE PARK AVENUE, NEW YORK, NY 10016-5990 USA;;;978-0-7918-4863-0;;;;2009;;;;;;;267;276;;;;;10;"Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Engineering, Biomedical; Engineering, Mechanical";"Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Engineering";BJH60;WOS:000265911300045;;;;;2021-03-18;

This relationship may be indirect and operate through factors such as disability, fatigue, mood, pain, self-efficacy and social support. The present study examined variables that might account for the relationship between physical activity and QOL in a sample (N = 292) of individuals with a definite diagnosis of MS. The participants wore an accelerometer for 7 days and then completed self-report measures of physical activity, QOL, disability, fatigue, mood, pain, self-efficacy and social support. The data were analysed using covariance modelling in Mplus 3.0. The model provided an excellent fit for the data (chi(2) = 51.33, df = 18, p < 0.001, standardised root mean squared residual = 0.03, comparative fit index = 0.98). Those who were more physically active reported lower levels of disability (gamma = -0.50), depression (gamma = -0.31), fatigue (gamma = -0.46) and pain (gamma = -0.19) and higher levels of social support (gamma = 0.20), self-efficacy for managing MS (gamma = 0.41), and self-efficacy for regular physical activity (gamma = 0.49). In turn, those who reported lower levels of depression (beta = -0.37), anxiety (beta = -0.15), fatigue (beta = -0.16) and pain (beta = -0.08) and higher levels of social support (beta = 0.26) and self-efficacy for controlling MS (beta = 0.17) reported higher levels of QOL.

We assessed serial samples of 18 MS patients, treated with IFN-beta for between 66 and 198 months, to characterize the affinity maturation of these antibodies using a biosensor-based approach ( Biacore (TM)). Biacore utilizes the principles of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) with data from the dissociation phase of the antigen antibody reaction being inversely proportional to relative antibody affinity. In patients with neutralizing antibodies (NAbs+), mean antibody dissociation rates decreased from 0.00118 +/- 0.00030 s(-1) at month 6 to 0.00021 +/- 0.00008 s(-1) at month 36, followed by a slight increase to 0.00027 +/- 0.00003 s(-1) at month 60. In NAb- patients, mean antibody dissociation rates decreased only very slightly from 0.00130 +/- 0.00025 s(-1) to 0.00105 +/- 0.00020 s(-1) at month 18, followed by a gradual increase to 0.00243 +/- 0.00099 s(-1) at month 60. Our study shows little improvement in antibody affinity in NAb- patients, in contrast to a marked increase in antibody affinity over time in NAb+ patients with a significant correlation between NAb titers and relative antibody dissociation rates ( Spearman's correlation, R(2) = -0.374, p < 0.001). The evaluation of relative antibody affinities will contribute to a thorough understanding of the anti-IFN-beta antibody response.;"[Gibbs, Ebrima; Oger, Joel] Univ British Columbia, Dept Med, NeuroImmunol Labs, Vancouver, BC V6T 2B5, Canada";Gibbs, E (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Med, NeuroImmunol Labs, Room S-159,2211 Wesbrook Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 2B5, Canada.;ebgibbs@interchange.ubc.ca;;;Multiple Sclerosis Society of Canada;We thank Regina Lam and Tariq Aziz for their excellent technical assistance, and members of my Ph.

Design: Repeated-measures design. Setting: General community. Participants: Volunteer sample of 17 men and 30 women (age range, 28-91y) living in the community with stroke of greater than 6 months in duration (n=20), Parkinson disease (n=7), or multiple sclerosis (n= 11), and healthy but sedentary controls (n=9). Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Physical activity measured with the TriTrac RT3 accelerometer, 7-day recall questionnaire, and activity diary. Results: The accelerometer reliably Measured free-living physical activity (intraclass correlation coefficient,.85; 95% confidence interval,.74-.91; P=.000). The standard error of measurement indicated that a second test Would differ from a baseline test by +/- 23%. Mean daily RT3 data collected in the first 3 days differed significantly from that of the mean daily RT3 data collected over 7 days. The RT3 appeared to distinguish level of mobility better than the 7-day recall questionnaire, and participants found the RT3 to be a User-friendly and acceptable measure of physical activity. Conclusions: The triaxial accelerometer provided a stable measure of free-living physical activity, was found to distinguish between people with varying levels of mobility, and was well tolerated by participants. The results indicate that collecting data for 3 days was not reflective of data collected over 7 days.";"[Hale, Leigh A.] Univ Otago, Ctr Physiotherapy Res, REAL Neurol Res Grp, Dunedin, New Zealand; Univ Otago, Sch Physiotherapy, Dunedin, New Zealand";Hale, LA (corresponding author), Univ Otago, Ctr Physiotherapy Res, REAL Neurol Res Grp, POB 56, Dunedin, New Zealand.;leigh.hale@otago.ac.nz;;;University of Otago;Supported by the University of Otago (research grant).;;34;77;78;0;10;W B SAUNDERS CO-ELSEVIER INC;PHILADELPHIA;1600 JOHN F KENNEDY BOULEVARD, STE 1800, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103-2899 USA;0003-9993;1532-821X;;ARCH PHYS MED REHAB;Arch.

The investigations have used either generic or disease-targeted instruments for measuring QOL and HRQL, but have not examined differences in the associations as a function of the types of instruments. Purpose The present study examined the associations among physical activity, QOL, and HRQL using generic and disease-targeted instruments in persons with multiple sclerosis (MS). Methods Participants were 292 individuals with MS who wore an accelerometer for 7 days and then completed the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ), Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale-29 (MSIS-29), Leeds Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life Scale (LMSQOL), Short Form-12 Health Survey (SF-12), and Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS). Results Accelerometer counts and GLTEQ scores had similarly sized correlations with scores from generic (SF-12) and the disease-specific (MSIS-29) measures of HRQL and generic (SWLS) and the disease-specific (LMSQOL) measures of QOL. Path analysis indicated a similar pattern of directional relationships between accelerometer counts and GLTEQ scores with physical and mental HRQL and, in turn, physical and mental HRQL with QOL using generic and disease-targeted instruments. Conclusions Our results suggest that in cross-sectional analysis, physical activity is similarly related with QOL and HRQL using generic and disease-targeted instruments in persons with MS.;"[Motl, Robert W.; McAuley, Edward; Snook, Erin M.; Gliottoni, Rachael C.] Univ Illinois, Dept Kinesiol & Community Hlth, Urbana, IL 61801 USA";Motl, RW (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Kinesiol & Community Hlth, 332 Freer Hall, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.;robmotl@uiuc.edu;;;"NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS) [R03NS054050, R03NS054050] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NINDS NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS) [R03 NS054050, R03 NS054050-01A1, NS054050] Funding Source: Medline";;;23;12;12;0;7;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;0883-6612;;;ANN BEHAV MED;Ann.

From an assisted-living facility, 21 participants who were independent ambulators ( n = 8) or who used a cane or walker ( n = 13) participated. Physical activity was measured with accelerometers, and depression, fatigue, and perceived heath status were assessed with questionnaires. There were no differences in physical activity, depression, fatigue, or perceived health status between those using and those not using assistive devices. However, 15% of the participants reported moderate to severe depression, and 40% of participants reported at least mild depression. Depression was strongly correlated to fatigue. Thus, physical activity, depression, fatigue, and perceived health are not associated with walker or cane use in assisted-living facilities.

The present study examined the nature of the associations among MS-related symptoms, exercise self-efficacy, and physical activity behavior in 80 individuals with a definite diagnosis of MS. Participants completed a measure of MS-related symptoms and self-efficacy and then wore an accelerometer for seven days. Both the frequency of overall symptoms and the frequency of motor symptoms had significant moderate inverse relationships with physical activity behavior (r = -0.47, P < 0.0001 and r = -0.49, P < 0.0001, respectively). Additionally, exercise self-efficacy was significantly and moderately correlated with physical activity (r = 0.39, P < 0.0001) and had significant and moderate inverse relationships with overall symptom frequency (r = -0.40, P < 0.0001) and motor symptom frequency (r = -0.30, P = 0.008).

As validation of scores from a measure is an ongoing and evolving process, the provision of additional evidence is warranted that confirms and extends the validity of inferences from scores on the MSWS-12. Method: Participants (N=133) were recruited through support group meetings of the Greater Illinois and Indiana State Chapters of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, and wore an accelerometer for a seven-day period and completed the MSWS-12 and other outcome measures. Results: Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that a single-factor model provided an adequate fit for MSWS-12 scores. MSWS-12 scores demonstrated strong evidence of internal consistency. The correlations between MSWS-12 scores with scores from other scales, including an accelerometer, were consistent with our a priori hypotheses. Conclusion: We provide evidence that both confirms and extends the validity of inferences from scores of the MSWS-12 as a measure of the impact of MS on walking in a community-based sample of individuals with MS.

Two algorithms for determining event times for treadmill and overground walking based solely on kinematic data are presented. Kinematic data from treadmill walking trials lasting 20-45 s were collected from three subject populations (healthy young, n = 7; multiple sclerosis, n = 7; stroke, n = 4). Overground walking trials consisted of approximately eight successful passes over two force plates for a healthy subject population (it = 5). Time of heel strike and toe-off were determined using the two new computational techniques and compared to events detected using vertical ground reaction force (GRF) as a gold standard. The two algorithms determined 94% of the treadmill events from healthy subjects within one frame (0.0167 s) of the GRF events. In the impaired populations, 89% of treadmill events were within two frames (0.0334 s) of the GRF events. For overground trials, 98% of events were within two frames.

Commercial screen-printed carbon electrodes were used as the basis for the sensor. Polyaniline was electrodeposited onto the sensors, and this modified surface then utilized to immobilize a biotinylated antibody for MBP using a classical avidin-biotin approach. Electrodes containing the antibodies were exposed to solutions of MBP and interrogated using an ac impedance protocol. The real component of the impedance of the electrodes was found to increase with increasing concentration of antigen. Control samples containing a nonspecific IgG antibody were also studied, and calibration curves were obtained by subtraction of the responses for specific and nonspecific antibody-based sensors, thereby accounting for and eliminating the effects of nonspecific adsorption of MBP.

Design: Exploratory, descriptive study. Subjects: Thirty individuals with multiple sclerosis and nine controls. Protocol: Individuals with multiple sclerosis were recruited to inactive, moderately active and active groups as defined by Adjusted Activity Scores from the Human Activity Profile. Control participants were recruited to an active group. Free-living physical activity was recorded over four consecutive days. Main measures: A TriTrac RT3 accelerometer and a self-report physical activity diary were used to measure activity. Results: Thirty-six participants completed data collection. For the participants with multiple sclerosis, both the accelerometer (P=0.004) and the diary (P=0.006) detected significant differences between inactive and active groups. The accelerometer also detected a significant difference between moderately active and active groups (P=0.04). In contrast, the diary detected a significant difference between inactive and moderately active groups (P=0.05). Accelerometer and diary scores were significantly correlated (r=0.59). Accelerometer scores were significantly correlated with neurological status (r(s) = -0.64). Conclusions: Both measures readily differentiated least active from most active groups. The accelerometer also differentiated moderately active from active groups, suggesting suitability for use in detecting change in more active client groups, while the diary differentiated inactive from moderately active groups, suggesting suitability for use in detecting change in less active groups.;"[Klassen, Laura; Schachter, Candice; Scudds, Rhonda] Univ Saskatchewan, Sch Phys Therapy, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0W3, Canada";Klassen, L (corresponding author), Univ Saskatchewan, Sch Phys Therapy, 1121 Coll Dr, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0W3, Canada.;laura.klassen@usask.ca;;;;;;35;16;16;0;3;SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD;LONDON;1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND;0269-2155;1477-0873;;CLIN REHABIL;Clin.

This type of measurement device has many different possible applications, ranging from clinical use with patients presenting a number of conditions such as upper motor neuron syndrome and pathologies that give rise to loss of dexterity, to competitive sports training and virtual reality. Here we focus on a design that minimizes the number of sensors whiIst delivering estimates of known accuracy over a defined frequency range. Minimizing the sensor count can make the measurement system less obtrusive, as well as minimising cost and reducing the required bandwidth if using a wireless solution. Accurate measurement of movement amplitude up to 15 Hz; is required in our immediate application, namely to quantify tremor in multiple sclerosis patients. The drive for low numbers of sensors and good accuracy at higher frequencies leads to a novel design based on composite filters. The simple estimator structure also gives good insight into the fundamental accuracy limitations based on the sensors chosen. This paper defines the underlying mathematics, and quantifies performance for an estimator for shoulder, upper arm, lower arm and hand orientations. Good estimation accuracy up to 15 Hz is indicated, and this with a reduced total sensor count of 18 compared to 24 that would be required for more conventional estimator architectures.";"[Hyde, Rick A.; Ketteringham, Laurence P.; Neild, Simon A.] Univ Bristol, Dept Mech Engn, Bristol BS8 1TR, Avon, England; [Jones, Rosie J.

The ferrocenyl moiety of these electrochemical probes did not affect autoantibody recognition both in SP-ELISA and in inhibition experiments. By electrochemical monitoring the interactions of the modified pepticles Fc-CSF114(Glc) and 4-FcPhP(S)Abu-CSF114(Glc) with the autoantibodies, we demonstrated that autoantibodies could be detected with a sensitivity comparable to ELISA method.

Twenty-nine white women (mean +/- standard deviation: age 45.1 +/- 9.0 yr, Expanded Disability Status Scale 2.9 +/- 1.2) diagnosed with MS were assessed for whole body (WB), proximal femur (PF) and lumbar spine (LS) bone status (bone mineral content [BMC], bone mineral density [BMD], and quantitative ultrasound index [QUI] by calcaneal quantitative ultrasound) and body composition by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry; for physical activity by pedometer and accelerometer; and for glucocorticoid medication exposure by self-report. Accelerometer counts were related to PF BMC (r = 0.50, p = 0.010) when we controlled for age, fat and lean mass, MS disease duration, and glucocorticoid use. Glucocorticoid use was not associated with bone measures. When we controlled for age and fat mass, lean mass was associated with WB BMC (r = 0.41, p = 0.04), PF BMC (r = 0.61, p = 0.001), and speed of sound (SOS) (r = 0.44, p = 0.02), whereas fat mass was associated with SOS and QUI (r = 0.43, p = 0.03, and r = 0.44, p = 0.02, respectively).

Objective. - To present a survey and demonstrate the contribution of neurophysiological assessment of side effects and effects on disabling motor symptoms at various steps of DBS surgery, and to confirm its role for optimal target localization, as an adjuvant to anatomic imaging. Material and methods. - The data result from 192 nuclei in 118 procedures on patients with Parkinson's disease (84), essential tremor (24), Hallenvorder Spatz dystonia (4), multiple sclerosis (4), and Holmes tremor (2). The intra operative neurophysiological monitoring (IOM) protocol consists of semimicroelectrode recording (for subthalamic nuclei), whereas accelerotransducers and spectral analysis allow assessment of tremor, finger tapping (FT), diadochokinesis (DDK), and determination of the distance between DBS electrodes and internal capsule (IC). Rigidity is assessed by surface EMG recordings in combination with a goniometer. Results. - The determination of the functional distance between the DBS electrode and the IC is based on the activation functions of axons in the IC. We show the high sensitivity of accelerometers for tremor over a large part of the body, the relationship between clinical scores and spectral frequencies of FT and DDK. Parkinsonian rigidity can be assessed from surface EMG (sEMG) by means of a balance coefficient, which can detect negative rigidity, for tow unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) scores (0-2) and quantified EMG when negative rigidity is excluded. Conclusion. - Accelerometer and sEMG recording have shown their value for intraoperative assessment of disabling motor symptoms and side effects during surgery, to optimize the target position electrodes for DBS. The combination with contemporary signal analyzing techniques permit intraoperative monitoring without a significant delay. IONM improves sensitivity and adds objective neurophysiological data.

Overexpression of IL-12 has been correlated to the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS). The prototype biosensor was fabricated on a disposable gold-coated silver ribbon electrode by immobilizing anti-IL-12 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) onto the surface of the electrode. This technique was advantageous as the silver electrodes provided a more rigid and conductive substrate than thin gold foil electrodes and helped in obtaining more reproducible data when used with the electrode holder. Results indicate that IL-12 can be detected atphysiological levels, < 100fM with p < 0.05 in a label-free and real-time manner. The cost-effective approach described here can be used for diagnosis of diseases (like MS) with known biomarkers in body fluids and for monitoring physiological levels of biomolecules with healthcare, food, and environmental relevance.

Design: Participants completed the PADS twice with seven days between repeated measures, while also wearing an Actical accelerometer. Semi-structured interview questions were used to explore the acceptability of the PADS. Subjects: Thirty participants were recruited from the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Auckland, New Zealand. Mean age of participants was 54 years (range 27-76). Main measures: Physical Activity and Disability Survey (PADS) and Actical accelerometer. Results: A wide range of standardized PADS scores were recorded at each time-point (ranges 6.7-83.3 and 6.7-87.4). While standardized PADS scores between time-points had a high intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.92 (95% confidence interval (0) 0.88, 0.98), Bland-Altman 95% limits of agreement (- 17.4, 17.4) were modest. Accelerometer activity counts were not accurately predicted by standardized PADS scores (wide 95% prediction intervals). Participants reported the PADS was easy to understand and complete, enabling them to give an accurate picture of their physical activity. Conclusions: The PADS appears to be a potentially appropriate measure of activity for people with multiple sclerosis, particularly in terms of the wide range of activities it covers and its ability to detect varying levels of physical activity.

Because most of these devices use proprietary equations developed from young, healthy adults, who did not possess any type of mobility deficiency, the estimated energy expenditure from these models often must be adjusted for subjects with neurological deficiencies. This study collected data from volunteers and built a regression model that better accounted for energy expended for ambulatory patients suffering from multiple sclerosis, stroke, or Parkinson's disease. Gender, age, overall assessment of a subject's gait, and possibly a walking regime proved predictive in estimating calories expended in addition to the accelerometer raw data values.;USAF, Inst Technol, Dept Math & Stat, Wright Patterson AFB, OH 45433 USA;White, ED (corresponding author), USAF, Inst Technol, Dept Math & Stat, 2950 Hobson Way,Bldg 641,WPAFB, Wright Patterson AFB, OH 45433 USA.;edward.white@afit.edu;;;;;;19;0;0;0;9;FREUND PUBLISHING HOUSE LTD;TEL AVIV;PO BOX 35010, TEL AVIV 61350, ISRAEL;1565-012X;;;INT J DISABIL HUM DE;Int.

In both disorders, motor disability results from complex interaction between kinetic tremor and accompanying ataxia with voluntary movements. In clinical studies, the efficacy of thalamic DBS has been thoroughly assessed. However, the optimal anatomical target structure for neurostimulation is still debated and has never been analysed in conjunction with objective measurements of the different aspects of motor impairment. In 10 essential tremor and II multiple sclerosis patients, we analysed the effect of thalamic DIBS through each contact of the quadripolar electrode on the contralateral tremor rating scale, accelerometry and kinematic measures of reach-to-grasp-movements. These measures were correlated with the anatomical position of the stimulating electrode in stereotactic space and in relation to nuclear boundaries derived from intraoperative microrecording. We found a significant impact of the stereotactic z-coordinate of stimulation contacts on the TRS, accelerometry total power and spatial deviation in the deceleration and target period of reach-to-grasp-movements. Most effective contacts clustered within the subthalamic area (STA) covering the posterior Zona incerta and prelemniscal radiation. Stimulation within this region led to a mean reduction of the lateralized tremor rating scale by 15.8 points which was significantly superior to stimulation within the thalamus (P < 0.05, student's t-test). STA stimulation resulted in reduction of the accelerometry total power by 99%, whereas stimulation at the ventral thalamic border (68%) or within the thalamus proper (2.5%) was significantly less effective (P < 0.01). Concomitantly, STA stimulation led to a significantly higher increase of tremor frequency and decrease in EMG synchronization compared to stimulation within the thalamus proper (P < 0.001). In reach-to-grasp movements, STA stimulation reduced the spatial variability of the movement path in the deceleration period by 28.9% and in the target period by 58.4%, whereas stimulation within the thalamus was again significantly less effective (P < 0.05), with a reduction in the deceleration period between 6.5 and 21.8% and in the target period between 1.2 and 11.3%. An analysis of the nuclear boundaries from intraoperative microrecording confirmed the anatomical impression that most effective electrodes were located within the STA. Our data demonstrate a profound effect of deep brain stimulation of the thalamic region on tremor and ataxia in essential tremor and tremor caused by multiple sclerosis. The better efficacy of stimulation within the STA compared to thalamus proper favours the concept of a modulation of cerebello-thalamic projections underlying the improvement of these symptoms.;"Univ Kiel, Dept Neurol, D-2300 Kiel, Germany; Univ Kiel, Dept Neurosurg, Kiel, Germany; Univ Kiel, Inst Expt & Appl Phys, Kiel, Germany; Univ Hamburg Hosp, Dept Neurosurg, D-2000 Hamburg, Germany";Volkmann, J (corresponding author), Univ Kiel, Kiel, Germany.;j.volkmann@neurologie.uni-kiel.de;"Volkmann, Jens/AAK-7570-2020; Steigerwald, Frank/C-1714-2012; Steigerwald, Frank/N-8595-2019";"Steigerwald, Frank/0000-0002-8305-1684; Volkmann, Jens/0000-0002-9570-593X; Deuschl, Gunther/0000-0002-4176-9196";;;;94;137;139;0;13;OXFORD UNIV PRESS;OXFORD;GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND;0006-8950;1460-2156;;BRAIN;Brain;JUN;2007;130;;6;;;;1608;1625;;10.1093/brain/awm077;;;18;"Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences";Neurosciences & Neurology;183IA;WOS:000247565300017;17439979;Bronze;;;2021-03-18;

Physical activity has been positively associated with QOL, but little is known about the factors that explain and/or confound the relationship in those with MS. On the basis of a social-cognitive perspective and previous research, the authors tested the hypothesis that physical activity would be indirectly associated with QOL through a mediated pathway that included self-efficacy and functional limitations, after controlling for perceived social support. Participants: Participants were 196 individuals with a definite diagnosis of MS living in the Midwest region of the United States who completed a battery of questionnaires and wore a pedometer and accelerometer for a 7-day period. Results: Covariance modeling analyses indicated that physical activity was indirectly associated with QOL through a pathway that included self-efficacy and functional limitations, and the pattern of relationships was independent of the perception of social support. Conclusions: The findings support physical activity as a possible modifiable behavior for mitigating reductions of QOL in those with MS and suggest that a social-cognitive model aids in the understanding of physical activity's relationships with QOL.;Univ Illinois, Dept Kinesiol & Community Hlth, Urbana, IL 61801 USA;Motl, RW (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Kinesiol & Community Hlth, 332 Freer Hall, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.;robmotl@uiuc.edu;McAuley, Edward/A-9508-2008;McAuley, Edward/0000-0002-4574-3292;;;;55;35;35;2;17;EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC;WASHINGTON;750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA;0090-5550;1939-1544;;REHABIL PSYCHOL;Rehabil.

On-line (device on) and residual short-term therapeutic effects on walking speed and stride length were measured in fourteen randomly selected patients with gait disturbances predominantly due to cerebellar ataxia. Results: Patients showed an average improvement of 12.84% on-line and 18.75% residually in walking speed. Average improvement in stride length was 8.30% on-line and 9.93% residually. The improvement results are particularly noteworthy when compared with the lack of change in healthy control subjects.

The ultimate aim is a standard measurement instrument integrated in a belt buckle that allows objective evaluation of treatment and rehabilitation measures in patients, in particular for disabling chronic diseases such as multiple sclerosis. In a first step we combined standard hardware elements to record test data from healthy volunteers. We then developed algorithms to automatically distinguish between different stages of activity, such as jogging, walking, lying, standing and sifting, and to detect and count steps. Distinction between standing and sitting is the most difficult to accomplish. As a first validation, we calculated the distance traveled from data of 17 experiments and a total of 4.5 h, for which one proband was walking and running for a known distance, and compared the results with two commercially available pedometers. We could show that the relative error for the ActiBelt is only half of that for the two pedometers.

Self-report instruments are commonly used to measure activity patterns; alternatively, actigraphs can be placed on several parts of the body. The aims of this study were to evaluate the superiority and specificity of actigraph placement ( wrist vs. ankle) in subjects with MS and healthy controls and explore the relationship between self-report and objective activity patterns. A total of 19 subjects with definite MS and 10 healthy volunteers wore actigraphs on the non-dominant wrist and ankle for three days while they kept a log to register performed activities every .5 h. Wrist and ankle actigraphs produced similar activity patterns during the most active hours (09:00-20:30 h) (ANOVA, time x location interaction: F = .901, df = 23, p = .597) in individuals with MS and healthy controls (between subjects factor F = 3.275, p = .083). Wrist placement of the actigraphs was better tolerated than ankle placement. Wrist actigraph data corresponded to a higher degree with self-reported activities of the upper limbs in the early afternoon, whereas ankle data seem to reflect better whole body movements in the later afternoon/early evening. Overall, actigraph data correlated moderately with self-reported activity (r = .57 for ankle and r = .59 for wrist). The regression model revealed that self-reported activities explained 44% of the variance in ankle and 50% of wrist data. Wrist and ankle actigraphs produce similar activity patterns in subjects with MS and in healthy controls; however, the placement of actigraphs on the wrist is better tolerated. Ankle actigraphs reflect general movement but underestimate upper body activity. Subjective registration of activity level partly matches with objective actigraph measurement. A combination of both objective and subjective activity registration is recommended to evaluate the physical activity pattern of subjects with MS.";"Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Rehabil Res, B-1090 Brussels, Belgium; Natl MS Ctr, Dept Rehabil, Melsbroek, Belgium; Natl MS Ctr, Dept Neurol, Melsbroek, Belgium; Univ Antwerp, Inst Born Bunge, Lab Neurochem & Behav, B-2020 Antwerp, Belgium; Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Human Biometry & Biomech, B-1090 Brussels, Belgium";Kos, D (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Rehabil Res, Laarbeeklaan 103, B-1090 Brussels, Belgium.;daphne.kos@vub.ac.be;"D'hooghe, Marie BGJ/G-3423-2013; Kos, Daphne/G-4376-2011";"Kos, Daphne/0000-0003-3566-2269; D'hooghe, Marie/0000-0002-0917-4176; Nagels, Guy/0000-0002-2597-0383";;;;37;31;31;0;11;TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC;PHILADELPHIA;530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA;0742-0528;1525-6073;;CHRONOBIOL INT;Chronobiol.

Participants were 30 individuals ( 28 females, two males) with an established definite diagnosis of MS. The participants wore a pedometer and a single-axis accelerometer during the waking hours of a 7-day period. After the 7-day period, participants returned to the lab and completed a self- administered physical activity questionnaire and then underwent a 7-day physical activity recall. Results. There were strong correlations ( a) between scores from the two self- report measures of physical activity and ( b) between scores from the two objective measures of physical activity, and ( c) weaker, but moderate-to-strong correlations between scores from the self- report and objective measures of physical activity. Conclusion. Our results support the quantification of physical activity among those with MS using validated self- report and objective measures.;Univ Illinois, Dept Kinesiol & Community Hlth, Urbana, IL 61801 USA;Motl, RW (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Kinesiol & Community Hlth, 332 Freer Hall, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.;robmotl@uiuc.edu;McAuley, Edward/A-9508-2008;McAuley, Edward/0000-0002-4574-3292;;;;19;125;125;0;18;TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0963-8288;1464-5165;;DISABIL REHABIL;Disabil.

One methodfor increasing the level of participation in physical activity among MS patients involves the identification of factors that correlate with physical activity and that are modifiable by a well-designed intervention. Purpose: This study adopts a social cognitive perspective and examines self-efficacy, enjoyment, social support, and disability as correlates of participation in physical activity among individuals with MS. Methods: We recruited 196 individuals with a diagnosis of MS front the Midwest region of the United States. The participants completed a battery of questionnaires and then wore a belt with an accelerometer for a 7-day period. The data were analyzed using covariance modeling. Results: Enjoyment (gamma =.38, p < .001), social support (gamma = .15, p < .05), and disability (gamma =. 18, p < .01) had statistically significant direct relations with self-efficacy, and self-efficacy (beta = .29, p < .001) and enjoyment (gamma = .28, p < .001) had statistically significant direct relations with physical activity.

How this network responds to motor training is not known. This study examined functional MRI (fMRI) activation patterns associated with performance of a motor task, consisting of repetition of directionally specific voluntary thumb movements, before and after motor training in a group of multiple sclerosis patients with mild motor impairment of the right upper extremity. Patients and healthy subjects were scanned in one session before, during and after a 30 min training period. fMRI data obtained during rest, thumb flexion (trained movement) and thumb extension (untrained movement) were analysed using random effects analysis (SPM99). Motor kinematics of training motions and EMG from the resting hand were monitored with an accelerometer and surface EMG electrodes. Kinematics of thumb movements before, during and after training were comparable in the absence of mirror EMG activity in the resting hand. Before training, thumb movements elicited more prominent activation of the contralateral dorsal premotor cortex [PMd, Brodmann area (BA) 6] in multiple sclerosis patients than in controls. After training, unlike the control group, multiple sclerosis patients did not exhibit task-specific reductions in activation in the contralateral primary somatosensory (S1), motor (M1) and adjacent parietal association (BA 40) cortices. These results indicate that patients engage the contralateral PMd more than controls in order to perform directionally specific movements before training. The absence of training-dependent reductions in activation in S1, M1 and BA 40 is consistent with a decreased capacity to optimize recruitment of the motor network with practice.;"NINDS, Human Cort Physiol Sect, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; NINDS, Neuroimmunol Branch, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; NIMH, Clin Brain Disorders Branch, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; NIH, Lab Radiol Res, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; Univ Giessen, Dept Neurol, Giessen, Germany; Bender Inst Neuroimaging, Giessen, Germany";Cohen, LG (corresponding author), NINDS, Human Cort Physiol Sect, NIH, Bldg 10,Room 5N226,10 Ctr Dr,MSC-1430, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.;"martinr@ninds.nih.gov; cohenL@ninds.nih.gov";Tessitore, Alessandro/K-3124-2018;"Tessitore, Alessandro/0000-0003-1740-8566; Kadom, Nadja/0000-0002-7073-956X";"NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS) [Z01NS002978, Z01NS002978, ZIANS002978, ZIANS002978, ZIANS002978, Z01NS002978, ZIANS002978, Z01NS002978, ZIANS002978, ZIANS002978, Z01NS002978, ZIANS002978, Z01NS002978, Z01NS002978, Z01NS002978, Z01NS002978, ZIANS002978, Z01NS002978, ZIANS002978, ZIANS002978] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; CLINICAL CENTER [Z01CL090001, Z01CL090001, Z01CL090001, ZIACL090001, Z01CL090001, Z01CL090001, Z01CL090001, Z01CL090001, Z01CL090001, Z01CL090001, Z01CL090001] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER";;;82;84;86;0;7;OXFORD UNIV PRESS;OXFORD;GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND;0006-8950;1460-2156;;BRAIN;Brain;NOV;2004;127;;11;;;;2506;2517;;10.1093/brain/awh266;;;12;"Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences";Neurosciences & Neurology;865LD;WOS:000224703700014;15456705;Bronze;;;2021-03-18;

Data from animal model experiments and subjective and small objective studies involving patients suggest that cannabis may be an effective treatment for tremor associated with MS. To our knowledge, there are no published double-blind randomized controlled trials of cannabis as a treatment for tremor in MS patients. Methods: The authors conducted a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial to examine the effect of oral cannador ( cannabis extract) on 14 patients with MS with upper limb tremors. There were eight women and six men, with a mean age of 45 years and mean Expanded Disability Status Scale score of 6.25. Patients were randomly assigned to receive each treatment and the doses escalated over a 2-week period before each assessment. The primary outcome was change on a tremor index, measured using a validated tremor rating scale. The study was powered to detect a functionally significant 50% improvement in the tremor index. Secondary outcomes included accelerometry, an ataxia scale, spiral drawing, finger tapping, and nine-hole pegboard test performance. Results: Analysis of the data showed no significant improvement in any of the objective measures of upper limb tremor with cannabis extract compared to placebo. Finger tapping was faster on placebo compared to cannabis extract ( p < 0.02). However, there was a nonsignificant trend for patients to experience more subjective relief from their tremors while on cannabis extract compared to placebo. Conclusions: Cannabis extract does not produce a functionally significant improvement in MS-associated tremor.;"Peninsula Med Sch, Plymouth, Devon, England; Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, London SW7 2AZ, England; Buckinghamshire Chilterns Univ Coll, High Wycombe, Bucks, England";Fox, P (corresponding author), Aberdeen Royal Infirm, Foresterhill, Aberdeen AB25 2ZN, Scotland.;patrick.fox@virgin.net;;"Glickman, Scott/0000-0002-8084-9949; Murray, Dianna/0000-0003-3481-825X";;;;17;78;81;0;8;LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS;PHILADELPHIA;530 WALNUT ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106-3621 USA;0028-3878;;;NEUROLOGY;Neurology;APR 13;2004;62;7;;;;;1105;1109;;10.1212/01.WNL.0000118203.67138.3E;;;5;Clinical Neurology;Neurosciences & Neurology;811JX;WOS:000220769300013;15079008;;;;2021-03-18;

In this study, we have investigated the effect of IFN-kappa on cells of the innate immune system by comparing cytokine release following treatment of human cells with either IFN-kappa or two recombinant IFN subtypes, IFN-beta and IFN-alpha2a. Although IFN-alpha2a failed to stimulate monocyte cytokine secretion, IFN-kappa, like IFN-beta, induced the release of several cytokines from both monocytes and dendritic cells, without the requirement of a costimulatory signal. IFN-kappa was particularly effective in inhibiting inducible IL-12 release from monocytes. Unlike IFN-beta, IFN-kappa did not induce release of IFN-gamma by PBL. Expression of the IFN-kappa mRNA was observed in resting dendritic cells and monocytes, and it was up-regulated by IFN-gamma stimulation in monocytes, while IFN-beta mRNA was minimally detectable under the same conditions. Monocyte and dendritic cell expression of IFN-kappa was also confirmed in vivo in chronic lesions of psoriasis vulgaris and atopic dermatitis. Finally, biosensor-based binding kinetic analysis revealed that IFN-kappa, like IFN-beta, binds strongly to heparin (K-d: 2.1 nM), suggesting that the cytokine can be retained close to the local site of production. The pattern of cytokines induced by IFN-kappa in monocytes, coupled with the unique induction of IFN-kappa mRNA by IFN-gamma, indicates a potential role for IFN-kappa in the regulation of immune cell functions.;"Human Genome Sci, Rockville, MD 20850 USA; Ist Dermopat Immacolata, Rome, Italy";Nardelli, B (corresponding author), Human Genome Sci, 9410 Key W Ave, Rockville, MD 20850 USA.;;;Albanesi, Cristina/0000-0002-7537-6833;;;;46;66;69;0;8;AMER ASSOC IMMUNOLOGISTS;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA;0022-1767;;;J IMMUNOL;J.

Surgery was not undertaken in 33 patients (72% of 46 cases referred for stereotactic surgery), two of whom died within 4 months of referral. Twenty-four multiple sclerosis patients were included in the study; 13 underwent surgery and were matched against 11 controls on the basis of age, sex, expanded disability system scores (EDSS) and disease duration. Assessments were carried out at baseline/preoperatively, and then 3 and 12 months later; these included accelerometric and clinical ratings of tremor, spirography, handwriting, a finger-tapping test, nine-hole peg test, tremor-related disability, general neurological examination, Barthel Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Index of general disability, EDSS, a 0-4 ataxia scale, Mini-Mental State (MMS) examination, speech and swallowing assessments and grip strength. Postoperative MRI scans demonstrated that tremor could be attenuated by lesions centred on the thalamus in seven cases, on the zona incerta in five cases and in the subthalamic nucleus in one case. Two patients developed hemiparesis and in two cases epilepsy recurred. Two surgical patients and one control patient died between the 3 and 6 months assessments. Both groups had a significant deterioration in EDSS but not Barthel ADL Index scores at 1 year, but the difference between the groups was not significant. Similarly, no differences between the groups' rates of deterioration of speech or swallowing or MMS were found. Significant improvements in contralateral upper limb postural (P2) and kinetic tremors, spiral scores and head tremor were detected at 3 and 12 months after surgery (but not handwriting or nine-hole peg test performance). Tremor-related disability and finger-tapping speed were also significantly better 12 months after surgery, the latter having significantly worsened for the control group. A 3 Hz 'filter' for postural (P2) upper limb tremor was detected by accelerometry/spectral analysis above which tremor was always abolished and at or below which some residual tremor invariably remained.

Patients on dialysis have reduced exercise tolerance compared with age-matched sedentary controls. The reasons for this debility have not been fully elucidated, but physical inactivity could be a contributing factor. The purpose of the current study was to determine whether patients on hemodialysis are less active than healthy sedentary controls and to explore clinical correlates of physical activity level in a group of hemodialysis patients. Methods. Thirty-four hemodialysis patients and 80 healthy sedentary individuals participated in the study. Physical activity was measured for seven days with a three-dimensional accelerometer and with an activity questionnaire. Results. Vector magnitude values from the accelerometer for the dialysis and control subjects were 104,718 +/- 9631 and 161,255 +/- 6792 arbitrary units per day, respectively (P < 0.0001, mean +/- SEM). The estimated energy expenditure values derived from the questionnaire were 33.6 +/- 0.5 kcal/kg/day and 36.2 +/- 0.5 kcal/kg/day (P = 0.002). The difference between patients on dialysis and controls increased with advancing age. Among the dialysis subjects, some measures of nutritional status correlated with physical activity level, including serum albumin concentration (r = 0.58, P = 0.003), serum creatinine concentration (r = 0.37, P = 0.03), and phase angle derived from bioelectrical impedance analysis (r = 0.40, P = 0.02). Conclusions. Patients on hemodialysis are less active than healthy sedentary controls, and this difference is more pronounced among older individuals. There is an association between the level of physical activity and nutritional status among patients on dialysis. These findings are of great concern, given the trend toward increasing age in incident dialysis patients and the well-known association between inactivity and increased mortality in the general population.;"Univ Calif San Francisco, Moffitt Long Hosp, San Francisco VA Med Ctr, Div Nephrol, San Francisco, CA USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, UCSF Mt Zion Med Ctr, San Francisco, CA USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, San Francisco Gen Hosp, Dept Med, San Francisco, CA USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, San Francisco Gen Hosp, Dept Radiol, San Francisco, CA USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, San Francisco Gen Hosp, Dept Physiol Nursing, San Francisco, CA USA";Johansen, KL (corresponding author), San Francisco VA Med Ctr, Div Nephrol 111J, 4150 Clement St, San Francisco, CA 94121 USA.;johanse@itsa.ucsf.edu;;;NCRR NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) [RR00083] Funding Source: Medline;;;29;274;283;1;20;ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC;NEW YORK;360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA;0085-2538;1523-1755;;KIDNEY INT;Kidney Int.;JUN;2000;57;6;;;;;2564;2570;;10.1046/j.1523-1755.2000.00116.x;;;7;Urology & Nephrology;Urology & Nephrology;319MQ;WOS:000087346100038;10844626;;;;2021-03-18;

Within minutes, major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-bound peptides on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) engaged the TCR to increase acidification rates of the extracellular media was measured by microphysiometer. We exposed two myelin peptide-specific human T-cell clones, MSF132E11 (DRB1*1501 restricted) and TOM3A6 (DRB5*0101 restricted), to truncated analogues of the parent MBP 84-102 peptide, in the presence of MHC restricted human antigen-presenting cells, and measured the extracellular acidification rate signal changes, IFN-gamma production and T-cell proliferation. The core epitopes recognized by these clones were identified by microphysiometer and found to be MBP 88-100 and MBP 91-100, respectively. These epitopes were identical to those identified by the IFN-gamma and proliferation assays. We conclude that measurement of real-time extracellular acidification rate signals by the microphysiometer may facilitate rapid identification of human T-cell epitopes involved in immune disorders and the development of specific T-cell antagonists.

The acceleration profile comprises high-amplitude pulsatile activity in the saccade and changes in the level of background ocular microtremor related to eye position. Adducting saccades of 20 degrees were recorded in eight patients with partial internuclear ophthalmoplegias caused by multiple sclerosis and in eight age-matched healthy subjects. The initial pulse of acceleration activity was reduced by 85% in the patients. In the worst-affected cases, adducting saccades were associated only with an increase in the level of background ocular microtremor in the acceleration trace.

Analyses of biopsies of the tibialis anterior muscle showed that there were fewer type I fibers (66 +/- 6 vs. 76 +/- 6%), and that fibers of all types were smaller (average down arrow 26%) and had lower succinic dehydrogenase (SDH; average down arrow 40%) and SDH/alpha-glycerol-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) but not GPDH activities in MS vs. control subjects, suggesting that muscle in this disease is smaller and relies more on anaerobic than aerobic-oxidative energy supply than does muscle of healthy individuals. Maximal voluntary isometric force for dorsiflexion was associated with both average fiber cross-sectional area (r = 0.71, P = 0.005) and muscle fat-free cross-sectional area by magnetic resonance imaging (r = 0.80, P < 0.001). Physical activity, assessed by accelerometer, was associated with average fiber SDH/GPDH (r = 0.78, P = 0.008). There was a tendency for symptomatic fatigue to be inversely associated with average fiber SDH activity (r = -0.57, P = 0.068). The results of this study suggest that the inherent characteristics of skeletal muscle fibers per se and of skeletal muscle as a whole are altered in the direction of disuse in MS. They also suggest that changes in skeletal muscle in MS may significantly affect function.";"UNIV CALIF SAN FRANCISCO,DEPT NEUROL,SAN FRANCISCO,CA 94121; CALIF PACIFIC MED CTR,DEPT NEUROL,SAN FRANCISCO,CA 94115; UNIV GEORGIA,DEPT EXERCISE SCI,ATHENS,GA 30602";KentBraun, JA (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF SAN FRANCISCO,VET ADM MED CTR,MAGNET RESONANCE UNIT,DEPT RADIOL,4150 CLEMENT ST,114M,SAN FRANCISCO,CA 94121, USA.;;;;;;;40;159;160;0;14;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814;8750-7587;;;J APPL PHYSIOL;J.

We tested the hypothesis that physical activity was lower in a group of 17 MS patients (mean +/- SD; age = 46 +/- 6 yr, 11 females, 6 males) compared with 15 healthy sedentary control subjects (age = 14 +/- 7 yr, 9 females, 6 males). Physical activity was measured with a three-dimensional accelerometer and with an activity questionnaire for 7 d. Vector magnitude values from the accelerometer for the MS and sedentary control subjects were 121,027 +/- 59,336 and 185,892 +/- 60,566 arbitrary units/day, respectively (P = 0.01). Estimated energy expenditure values derived from the questionnaire were 35.9 +/- 3.0 and 36.2 +/- 4.1 Kcal.kg(-1).d(-1) (NS), respectively. Thus, when measured directly with an accelerometer, activity was lower in MS compared with sedentary control subjects. The data also suggest that the accelerometer was more sensitive than the questionnaire for detecting differences in activity between two relatively sedentary populations, including one with neurologic disease.";CALIF PACIFIC MED CTR, DEPT NEUROL, SAN FRANCISCO, CA USA;Ng, AV (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF SAN FRANCISCO, VET ADM MED CTR, MRU 114M, DEPT RADIOL, 4150 CLEMENT ST, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94121 USA.;;;;;;;44;144;144;0;12;LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS;PHILADELPHIA;TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA;0195-9131;1530-0315;;MED SCI SPORT EXER;Med.
