9,"KentBraun, JA; Ng, AV; Castro, M; Weiner, MW; Gelinas, D; Dudley, GA; Miller, RG","Strength, skeletal muscle composition, and enzyme activity in multiple sclerosis",JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSIOLOGY,1997,"This study examined functional, biochemical, and morphological characteristics of skeletal muscle in nine multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and eight healthy controls in an effort to ascertain whether intramuscular adaptations could account for excessive fatigue in this disease. Analyses of biopsies of the tibialis anterior muscle showed that there were fewer type I fibers (66 +/- 6 vs. 76 +/- 6%), and that fibers of all types were smaller (average down arrow 26%) and had lower succinic dehydrogenase (SDH; average down arrow 40%) and SDH/alpha-glycerol-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) but not GPDH activities in MS vs. control subjects, suggesting that muscle in this disease is smaller and relies more on anaerobic than aerobic-oxidative energy supply than does muscle of healthy individuals. Maximal voluntary isometric force for dorsiflexion was associated with both average fiber cross-sectional area (r = 0.71, P = 0.005) and muscle fat-free cross-sectional area by magnetic resonance imaging (r = 0.80, P < 0.001). Physical activity, assessed by accelerometer, was associated with average fiber SDH/GPDH (r = 0.78, P = 0.008). There was a tendency for symptomatic fatigue to be inversely associated with average fiber SDH activity (r = -0.57, P = 0.068). The results of this study suggest that the inherent characteristics of skeletal muscle fibers per se and of skeletal muscle as a whole are altered in the direction of disuse in MS. They also suggest that changes in skeletal muscle in MS may significantly affect function.",Article,NA,WOS:A1997YK80700028,WoS,No,Out of scope (topic),,yes,,,included,

The acceleration profile comprises high-amplitude pulsatile activity in the saccade and changes in the level of background ocular microtremor related to eye position. Adducting saccades of 20 degrees were recorded in eight patients with partial internuclear ophthalmoplegias caused by multiple sclerosis and in eight age-matched healthy subjects. The initial pulse of acceleration activity was reduced by 85% in the patients. In the worst-affected cases, adducting saccades were associated only with an increase in the level of background ocular microtremor in the acceleration trace. The results confirm the hypothesis that an internuclear ophthalmoplegia is due to the loss of the pulse signal to ocular motor neurons, with preservation of the step signal in an adducting saccade.",Article,NA,WOS:000074031600009,WoS,Yes,,,no,Out of scope,,Out of scope (topic),saccades only

Methods: An auditory feedback cue, responding to the patient's own steps in closed-loop, was produced by a wearable motion sensor and delivered to the patient through ear phones. On-line (device on) and residual short-term therapeutic effects on walking speed and stride length were measured in fourteen randomly selected patients with gait disturbances predominantly due to cerebellar ataxia. Results: Patients showed an average improvement of 12.84% on-line and 18.75% residually in walking speed. Average improvement in stride length was 8.30% on-line and 9.93% residually. The improvement results are particularly noteworthy when compared with the lack of change in healthy control subjects.

The ultimate aim is a standard measurement instrument integrated in a belt buckle that allows objective evaluation of treatment and rehabilitation measures in patients, in particular for disabling chronic diseases such as multiple sclerosis. In a first step we combined standard hardware elements to record test data from healthy volunteers. We then developed algorithms to automatically distinguish between different stages of activity, such as jogging, walking, lying, standing and sitting, and to detect and count steps. Distinction between standing and sitting is the most difficult to accomplish. As a first validation, we calculated the distance traveled from data of 17 experiments and a total of 4.5 h, for which one proband was walking and running for a known distance, and compared the results with two commercially available pedometers. We could show that the relative error for the ActiBelt is only half of that for the two pedometers. Apart from developing much smaller, robust and integrated hardware, we describe ideas on how to develop algorithms that allow extraction of a """"baseline step pattern"""" in analogy to baseline ECG to define and detect clinically relevant deviations. ©2007 by Walter de Gruyter.",Article,10.1515/BMT.2007.028,http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=00135585&id=doi:10.1515%2FBMT.2007.028&atitle=Steps+towards+a+miniaturized%2C+robust+and+autonomous+measurement+device+for+the+long-term+monitoring+of+patient+activity%3A+ActiBelt&stitle=Biomed.+Tech.&title=Biomedizinische+Technik&volume=52&issue=1&spage=149&epage=155&aulast=Daumer&aufirst=Martin&auinit=M.&aufull=Daumer+M.&coden=BMZTA&isbn=&pages=149-155&date=2007&auinit1=M&auinitm=,Embase,No,Out of scope (topic),,yes,,,Out of scope (outcomes),"New accelerometer belt compared to standard pedometers, nonetheless interesting (Actibelt) => Review2"

Design: Participants completed the PADS twice with seven days between repeated measures, while also wearing an Actical accelerometer. Semi-structured interview questions were used to explore the acceptability of the PADS. Subjects: Thirty participants were recruited from the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Auckland, New Zealand. Mean age of participants was 54 years (range 27-76). Main measures: Physical Activity and Disability Survey (PADS) and Actical accelerometer. Results: A wide range of standardized PADS scores were recorded at each time-point (ranges 6.7-83.3 and 6.7-87.4). While standardized PADS scores between time-points had a high intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.92 (95% confidence interval (Cl) 0.88, 0.98), Bland-Altman 95% limits of agreement (- 17.4, 17.4) were modest. Accelerometer activity counts were not accurately predicted by standardized PADS scores (wide 95% prediction intervals). Participants reported the PADS was easy to understand and complete, enabling them to give an accurate picture of their physical activity. Conclusions: The PADS appears to be a potentially appropriate measure of activity for people with multiple sclerosis, particularly in terms of the wide range of activities it covers and its ability to detect varying levels of physical activity. We suggest the test-retest reliability and validity of the PADS could be improved with some minor revisions. © 2007 Sage Publications.",Article,10.1177/0269215507075516,http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=02692155&id=doi:10.1177%2F0269215507075516&atitle=The+Physical+Activity+and+Disability+Survey+%28PADS%29%3A+Reliability%2C+validity+and+acceptability+in+people+with+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Clin.+Rehabil.&title=Clinical+Rehabilitation&volume=21&issue=7&spage=628&epage=639&aulast=Kayes&aufirst=Nicola+M&auinit=N.M.&aufull=Kayes+N.M.&coden=CEHAE&isbn=&pages=628-639&date=2007&auinit1=N&auinitm=M,Embase,Yes,,,no,Out of scope,Standardized Physical Activity and Disability Survey (PADS),included,accelerometer used as outcome measure

As validation of scores from a measure is an ongoing and evolving process, the provision of additional evidence is warranted that confirms and extends the validity of inferences from scores on the MSWS-12. Method: Participants (N = 133) were recruited through support group meetings of the Greater Illinois and Indiana State Chapters of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, and wore an accelerometer for a seven-day period and completed the MSWS-12 and other outcome measures. Results: Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that a single-factor model provided an adequate fit for MSWS-12 scores. MSWS-12 scores demonstrated strong evidence of internal consistency. The correlations between MSWS-12 scores with scores from other scales, including an accelerometer, were consistent with our a priori hypotheses.

Calibration of accelerometer output for ambulatory adults with multiple sclerosis. Objectives: To examine the association between the rates of accelerometer activity counts and energy expenditure during walking in persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) versus controls and then to calibrate the output of accelerometers for computing time spent in light, moderate, and vigorous physical activity based on common metabolic equivalent unit categories in persons with MS. Design: Mixed-model design. Setting: Laboratory. Participants: People with MS (n=24) and people without MS (n=24) who were similar in age, sex, height, and weight. Interventions: The participants undertook three 6-minute periods of walking at 3.2, 4.8, and 6.4km·h(-1) on a motor-driven treadmill. Main Outcome Measures: Activity counts and energy expenditure were measured with an accelerometer worn on the right hip and open-circuit spirometry, respectively. Results: The results indicated that (1) persons with MS had greater energy expenditure, but not activity counts, during walking on a treadmill than did controls; (2) there was a strong linear relationship between activity counts and energy expenditure during treadmill walking, but the slope of the relationship was steeper in persons with MS than in controls; and (3) the cut-points for light, moderate, and vigorous physical activity were lower in persons with MS than in controls. Conclusions: Such findings provide evidence for a strong linear relationship between activity counts and energy expenditure during walking in persons with MS and cut-points based on counts per minute for quantifying time spent in light, moderate, and vigorous physical activity using accelerometers in this population. © 2009 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine.",Article,10.1016/J.APMR.2009.03.020,http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=00039993&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.apmr.2009.03.020&atitle=Calibration+of+Accelerometer+Output+for+Ambulatory+Adults+With+Multiple+Sclerosis&stitle=Arch.+Phys.+Med.+Rehabil.&title=Archives+of+Physical+Medicine+and+Rehabilitation&volume=90&issue=10&spage=1778&epage=1784&aulast=Motl&aufirst=Robert+W.&auinit=R.W.&aufull=Motl+R.W.&coden=APMHA&isbn=&pages=1778-1784&date=2009&auinit1=R&auinitm=W,Embase,Yes,,,no,Out of scope,,included,accelerometer used as outcome measure

Methods: The sample included 133 individuals with MS who completed the SI-L, Performance Scales (PS), EDSS, Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale-12 (MSWS-12), Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale-29 (MSIS-29), and Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ) and then wore an accelerometer for 7 days. The data were analyzed using SPSS, version 16.0. Results: There were large correlations between SI-S and SI-L total and subscale scores and between SI-S, SI-L, and PS total scores. The correlations were similar in magnitude between SI-S, SI-L, and PS scores with EDSS and MSIS-29 scores, but not with MSWS-12, accelerometer, and GLTEQ scores. Discriminant function analysis indicated that SI-S scores better differentiated groups with minimal, moderate, and severe disability than did SI-L and PS scores. Regression analysis indicated that SI-S and SI-L scores explained incrementally more variance in EDSS, MSWS-12, and MSIS-29 scores after accounting for PS scores alone. Conclusion: Such findings provide additional support for the validity of both SI-S and SI-L scores in individuals with MS and support the adoption of either the SI-S or SI-L by clinical MS researchers. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Surface electromyogram (EMG) measurements are taken simultaneously to provide gross muscle activity data. A dynamic model is used to simulate the movements, allowing particular sites to be studied in detail. Initial movement data is presented, comparing analysed EMG data and torque estimated by the dynamic model around the elbow joint. Despite the simple analysis, a good fit was obtained. The dynamic model includes a neuromuscular modelling system which will be used in future work to simulate the interactions between measured movements containing intention tremor and the intention behind them, allowing better understanding of the tremor and creating better descriptions of the tremor. Future work will use measured data and modelling to develop methods of attenuating intention tremor, by providing real-time feedback control of tremor reduction devices, without adversely affecting the underlying intended movement.",Proceedings Paper,NA,WOS:000265911300045,WoS,No,Duplicate,,yes,,Multiple sensors on body,included,

To compare the effects of gait training with distinct glide-symmetric visual feedback cues, adapted to the geometry of human locomotion, to the effects of training with visual cues of no distinct symmetry, on the walking abilities of subjects with gait disorders due to multiple sclerosis (MS). Methods. Ten patients trained with transverse lines while 11 patients trained with checkerboard tiles, both provided by a wearable virtual reality device. Baseline performance (walking speed and stride length along a 10m straight track) was measured before device use. Following 20min training with the device and 10min rest, performance without the device was measured again and compared to the baseline performance. Results. The average improvement in the group using the visual cue of transverse lines was 7.79±4.24 in walking speed and 7.20±3.92 in stride length. The average improvement in the group using the visual cue of checkerboard tiles was 21.09±18.39 in walking speed and 12.99±1.72 in stride length. Conclusions.

Fifty persons with multiple sclerosis (Expanded Disability Status Scale, EDSS, 1.5-6.5) were tested on leg muscle strength as well as walking and balance capacity, and completed self-report indices on perceived physical functioning. Habitual walking performance, that is, the real amount of steps that is performed in the customary living environment, was registered by means of an ambulant accelerometer-based monitor during seven consecutive days. Mild (EDSS 1.5-4.0, n = 29) and moderate (EDSS 4.5-6.5, n = 21) multiple sclerosis subgroups were additionally distinguished as predictor variables and values were hypothesized to differ depending on multiple sclerosis severity and concomitant ambulatory function. Multiple regression analyses yielded a single most significant predictor for each (sub)group with other variables making no independent contribution to the variation in habitual walking performance. For the total study sample, this was the 6-Minute Walking Test (R(2) = 0.458, p < 0.01). In the mild multiple sclerosis subgroup, the 6-Minute Walking Test was again most predictive, yet to a modest degree (R(2) = 0. 187, p = 0.02). In the moderate multiple sclerosis subgroup, the 2-Minute Walking Test explained over half of the variance (R(2) = 0.532, p < 0.01). Habitual walking performance is best reflected by longer walking capacity tests. The extent to which it can be predicted based on clinical testing is larger in a multiple sclerosis patient sample with more severe walking disability. Ambulatory monitoring, however, includes aspects of community ambulation not captured in the clinic, and must be considered as an additional outcome for evaluating interventions in multiple sclerosis. © 2010 The Author(s).",Article,10.1177/1352458510361357,http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13524585&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458510361357&atitle=Predicting+habitual+walking+performance+in+multiple+sclerosis%3A+Relevance+of+capacity+and+self-report+measures&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=16&issue=5&spage=618&epage=626&aulast=Gijbels&aufirst=Domien&auinit=D.&aufull=Gijbels+D.&coden=MUSCF&isbn=&pages=618-626&date=2010&auinit1=D&auinitm=,Embase,No,Out of scope (topic),,yes,,,included,accelerometer used as outcome measure

The evaluation of the effectiveness of an orthosis is generally based on subjective criteria, on functional scores or on motor performance tests [1-3]. Wearable inertial devices can be reliably used in these cases for outcome measurements with respect to the proposed treatment [4,5]. Material and methods A 62mm×36mm×16mm, Free4Act device, sampling frequency 50 Hz, was stuck at the L5 level, in 10 hemiplegic patients (5 with stroke and in 5 patients with Multiple Sclerosis). The equinus foot was corrected using an AFO. Subjects were asked to walk 20 meter distance at comfortable speed, and gait time-distance parameters were reconstructed by means of the device. Subjects performed three walking repetitions, with and without the orthosis. Data of patients were compared with those of normal subjects previously acquired and validated with a Vicon stereophotogrammetric system 612. Results Although many parameters showed improvement on an individual basis none of them resulted statistically significant when the entire sample of patients was analysed (Mann Whitney with exact method for small samples). (Table presented) Discussion These results show that the inertial device is sensitive to measure gait parameters providing a useful indicator of outcome in patients with AFO. Such measurements could be differently achieved only by means of traditional gait analysis, which however is expensive, is based on a few steps under conditions of walk constrained by the laboratory which does not reflect the environment in which the patient usually moves.",Conference Abstract,10.1016/J.GAITPOST.2010.10.081,http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=09666362&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.gaitpost.2010.10.081&atitle=A+new+inertial+wireless+dispositive+for+gait+analysis%3A+Functional+outcome+measures+in+patients+with+AFO&stitle=Gait+Posture&title=Gait+and+Posture&volume=33&issue=&spage=S65&epage=SS66&aulast=Benedetti&aufirst=M.G.&auinit=M.G.&aufull=Benedetti+M.G.&coden=&isbn=&pages=S65-SS66&date=2011&auinit1=M&auinitm=G,Embase,Yes,,,no,Abstract,,Abstract only,"-> discussion, interesting for ankle orthesis"

Objective: To evaluate the relationship of gait parameters, and demographic and physical characteristics in healthy men and women. Design, Setting, and Participants: Recruitment of a subsample (n = 358) of male and female blood donors taking part in the Cambridge CardioResource study. Collection of demographic data, measurement of physical characteristics (height, weight and blood pressure) and assessment of 7-day, free-living activity parameters using accelerometry and a novel algorithm to measure walking speed. Participants were a median (interquartile range[IQR]) age of 49 (16) years; 45% women; and had a median (IQR) BMI of 26 (5.4). Main Outcome Measure: Walking speed. Results: In this study, the hypothesis that walking speed declines with age was generated using an initial 'open' dataset. This was subsequently validated in a separate 'closed' dataset that showed a decrease of walking speed of -0.0037 m/s per year. This is equivalent to a difference of 1.2 minutes, when walking a distance of 1 km aged 20 compared to 60 years. Associations between walking speed and other participant characteristics (i.e. gender, BMI and blood pressure) were non-significant. BMI was negatively correlated with the number of walking and running steps and longest non-stop distance. Conclusion: This is the first study using accelerometry which shows an association between walking speed and age in free-living, healthy individuals. Absolute values of gait speed are comparable to published normal ranges in clinical settings. This study highlights the potential use of mobile accelerometry to assess gait parameters which may be indicative of future health outcomes in healthy individuals. © 2011 Schimpl et al.",Article,10.1371/JOURNAL.PONE.0023299,http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=19326203&id=doi:10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0023299&atitle=Association+between+walking+speed+and+age+in+healthy%2C+free-living+individuals+using+mobile+accelerometry-a+cross-sectional+study&stitle=PLoS+ONE&title=PLoS+ONE&volume=6&issue=8&spage=&epage=&aulast=Schimpl&aufirst=Michaela&auinit=M.&aufull=Schimpl+M.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2011&auinit1=M&auinitm=,Embase,Yes,,,no,Out of scope,No MS Patients,Out of scope (topic),Actibelt

Am J Phys Med Rehabil 2011;90:372-379. Objective: There is currently no published evidence from longitudinal or intervention studies of an association between lifestyle physical activity and walking impairment in persons with multiple sclerosis. This panel study tested the hypothesis that a change in lifestyle physical activity would be inversely associated with change in walking impairment over a 6-mo period in persons with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Design: Participants with a confirmed diagnosis of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis completed a battery of measures at baseline (n = 269) and at 6-mo follow-up (n = 263) in the absence of an intervention. The data were analyzed using linear panel analysis and covariance modeling in Mplus 3.0. Results: The panel model fit the data (chi(2) = 25.23; df = 12; P = 0.01; standardized root-mean-squared residual, 0.04; comparative fit index, 0.98) and, as expected, identified the direct effects between baseline physical activity and walking impairment (path coefficient, -0.31) and follow-up physical activity and walking impairment (path coefficient, -0.16). The second path coefficient indicated that a standard deviation unit change of 1 in physical activity was associated with a standard deviation unit residual change of 0.16 in walking impairment.

A remarkable number of self-report scales or clinical performance-based measures attempt to quantify various aspects of fatigue, but there is no accepted standard. We used mobile accelerometry to find novel patient-oriented outcome parameters that are di-rectly related to certain aspects of fatigue: the ability to walk long distances and the corre-sponding walking speed within these long distances in free-living conditions. Methods: 47 MS patients recorded a 7-day measurement with the actibelt, a tri-axial accelerometer (100Hz, 512MB) integrated in a belt buckle. Two novel parameters were extracted from accelerometry data: step ratio (SR) and velocity ratio (VR). SR is defined as the proportion of steps within sequences of more than a certain number of steps in a row (i.e. 50, 100) in rela-tion to the total number of steps; velocity ratio (VR) is the mean walking speed within these high-order step sequences. Subsequently, SR and VR were compared to relevant patient data: expanded disability status scale (EDSS), self-reported walking distance limit (WDL), maxi-mum oxygen uptake (VO2max) and scores from a fatigue-specific questionnaire (WEIMuS). Spearman rank correlation coefficients were used to assess the correlation between acceler-ometry and patient data. Results: Data on 47 patients (81% female, age 42±10 years, EDSS 3.1±0.9, WDL 7579±8389 m, VO2max 24.8±8.1 ml/kg/ min) were available for analysis. Both SR50 and SR100 showed a positive correlation with WDL (0.60 and 0.59, p=0.002 and 0.003) and VO2max (0.37 and 0.31, p=0.010 and 0.036). VR50 and VR100 showed a negative correlation with EDSS (-0.56 and -0.53, p < 0.001 for both) and a positive correlation with WDL (0.74 and 0.68, p< 0.001 for both) and VO2max (0.38 and 0.44, p=0.009 and 0.002). WEIMuS scores were not signifi-cantly associated to any of the accelerometry or patient variables. Discussion/Conclusion: SR and VR are promising candidate variables to objectively capture important aspects of fa-tigue that are not reflected well by the WEIMuS questionnaire score. Comparison with clini-cal measures of endurance capacity and patient-reported limitations of walking indicate a high level of construct and ecological validity.

Methods: Subjects wore an accelerometer (ActiGraph GT1M, Pensacola, FL) from 8am to 9pm for seven consecutive days. Activity counts recorded during this period were analyzed in one minute epochs and categorized into one of four PA levels: Light ? 1952 counts (< 2.99 metabolic equivalents (METS)), moderate 1953-5724 counts (3.0-5.99 METS), hard 5725-9498 counts (6.0-8.99 METS), and very hard > 9498 counts (> 9.0 METS). Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) was measured by a single treating neurologist. Results: Using a cross-sectional design, 11 females and 4 males (aged 48.8 ± 3.5, 40.5 ± 2.6 years) participated in this study (Kurtzke EDSS range of 0.5-6.5, mean = 2.6). All participants wore the accelerometer as instructed without difficulties. Appropriate data were retrieved from the devices for the predetermined monitoring period. There were significant negative correlations for minutes spent in PA and EDSS measures on the week days (r = -.61), weekend (r = -.64), and the full week (r = -.61), as well as for number of steps taken on week days (r = -.56), weekend (r = -.80) and on full week average, (r = -.68). A significant positive correlation was evident for minutes spent in light PA (according to METS) and EDSS (r = .69). However, for minutes spent in moderate and heavy PA and EDSS, significant negative correlations were found (r = -.56) and (r = -.53) respectively.No significance was found in minutes spent in very hard PA and EDSS (r = -.34). Conclusion: This study documents that accelerometers can be used to objectively quantify PA during normal daily routines in ambulatory MS individuals of different disability levels. This cohort demonstrated that the amount of PA is inversely proportional to the degree of physical disability, and that more PA was performed during weekends.

143,"O'Dwyer C., Coote S.",Validity of the sensewear armband and activpal activity monitors in multiple sclerosis,Physiotherapy (United Kingdom),2011,"Purpose: To determine the criterion validity of the Sens Wear Armband (SWA) and ActivPAL (AP) activity monitors as a measure of physical activity (steps and energy expenditure) in persons with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). Relevance: Research has found that PwMS are significantly less physically active than healthy individuals (Motl et al., 2005). The majority of physical activity (PA) research has utilised subjective measurement tools which have notable associated limitations. Accelerometry based activity monitors are thought to provide the optimal objective PA measurement tool. However, no research to date has examined the criterion validity of any such device in PwMS. Participants: 30 subjects with MS and 15 healthy control subjects were recruited through the MS Society and via campus-wide email. Subjects with MS mobilised either independently or with the assistance of one stick (MSA) or with bilateral aids or a walking frame (MSB). Subjects were excluded if they were currently experiencing a worsening of symptoms due to a relapse. Methods: The Oxycon Mobile indirect calorimetry unit was the criterion method of measuring energy expenditure with the proprietary algorithms used to estimate steps and METs. Subjects were fitted with the AP on the mid-thigh, the SWA over the triceps and a facemask attached to the Oxycon Mobile unit. Subjects performed nine ADL activities as follows: dressing, walking, watching television, washing dishes, reading, stair climbing, writing/typing, dusting and folding laundry. Each activity lasted 10 minutes with the exception of stair-climbing which was 5 minute duration. The entire procedure was video recorded and steps taken were manually counted (criterion method). Analysis: Intra-class correlation coefficients and Bland and Altman analysis was used to determine the level of agreement between methods. The percentage error between methods was also calculated. Results: The SWA demonstrated a smaller percentage error (range 0.94% to -29.39%) across groups for step count than the AP (range -31.93% to -34.5%). The mean difference from manual step count for the SWA was 20 steps for the control group, 397 steps for MSA and 320 steps for MSB, as against 695 steps for the control group, 545 steps and 376 steps for the MSA and MSB groups respectively with the AP. The SWA had ICC's of 0.5-0.63 compared to 0.1-0.16 for the AP for METs and a notably smaller mean difference also. Conclusions: The SWA is better than the ActivPAL for measuring both steps and energy expenditure during combined upper and lower limbADL's when using the proprietary algorithms. The validity of the SWA for step count is negatively affected by gait impairment. The AP is a poor estimate of energy expenditure in PwMS. Implications: Future PA research in MS should use the SWA as these results suggest it is a valid estimate of steps and energy expenditure in PwMS. Future research should incorporate PA as an outcome measure in intervention studies examining the effects of exercise interventions in MS.",Conference Abstract,10.1016/J.PHYSIO.2011.04.002,http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=00319406&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.physio.2011.04.002&atitle=Validity+of+the+sensewear+armband+and+activpal+activity+monitors+in+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Physiotherapy&title=Physiotherapy+%28United+Kingdom%29&volume=97&issue=&spage=eS235&epage=eS236&aulast=O%27Dwyer&aufirst=C.&auinit=C.&aufull=O%27Dwyer+C.&coden=&isbn=&pages=eS235-eS236&date=2011&auinit1=C&auinitm=,Embase,Yes,,,no,Abstract,,Abstract only,

We investigated the association between measurements of the 6MWT and walking speed in the real life situation of MS patients with mild and moderate disability. Methods: MS patients (EDSS: 1-6.5) performed a 6MWT in an outpatient clinic. In a corresponding one-week measurement patients were equipped with a 3D accelerometry hidden in a belt buckle (actibelt) for continuous assessment through 7 days. Walking speed (main parameter), distance and sequences of steps in a row were automatically extracted from the recorded data using standardized software packages. In order to reassess the precision of the speed extraction, patients were also equipped with the actibelt during the 6MWT. Results: 30 patients (67% female) with mean (SD) EDSS 3.6 (1.6) were included in the study. Mean MS duration was 10.7 and mean age 44.4 years. Patients with EDSS 6 or 6.5 (n=5) were not able to complete the 6MWT. In 2 patients (both EDSS 4) the algorithm to determine the walking speed failed. For the remaining 23 patients mean (SD) difference between actual (measured by physician) and actibelt walking speed during the 6MWT was 0.055 (0.188) m/s. Walking sequences of at least 6 minutes are rare in daily life (<1 sequences/day). Even 2 minute sequences occur only typically 3 times per day. Mean daily life walking speed was lower than the 6MWT walking speed (diff.: -0.26 m/s, p=0.002). The difference was larger in patients with EDSS <= 3 (mean walking speed daily life vs. 6MWT: 1.16 m/s vs. 1.53 m/s) compared to those with EDSS 3.5-4.5 (1.08 m/s vs. 1.16 m/s). In real-life walking sequences of >=2min, the 85% quantile of all walking speeds reflects the 6MWT performance of patients with EDSS <=3 (mean diff. < 0.01 m/s). R2 of the corresponding linear model was 0.57 and Pearson's correlation coefficient was 0.755 (p<0.001). Conclusion: 6MWT has limited ecological validity. Ability to complete the 6MWT does not imply that patients typically walk 6 minutes or longer at least once per day in real life situations. For low disability levels the average daily life walking speed was 0.37 (0.14) m/s slower than the 6MWT speed. For higher disability levels 6MWT walking speed was closer to mean real life walking speed. It depends on the clinical question at hand whether the 6MWT is sufficient or if long-term monitoring with mobile accelerometry is needed.",Conference Abstract,10.1177/1352458512444209,http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13524585&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458512444209&atitle=Ecological+validity+of+the+6+minute+walking+test+in+MS+patients+%28%2321%29&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=18&issue=5&spage=S19&epage=S20&aulast=Neuhaus&aufirst=A.&auinit=A.&aufull=Neuhaus+A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=S19-S20&date=2012&auinit1=A&auinitm=,Embase,Yes,,,no,Abstract,,Abstract only,

Specific: (a) determine whether a phone's accelerometer has sensitivity comparable to those of laboratory tools, and (b) determine whether it is possible to analyse tremor amplitude and spectral characteristics directly on the smart phone. Background: In laboratories, pathological tremor is usually quantified and characterized with accelerometers. This type of device can be found in new emerging technology, i.e. smart phones. We propose to use this type of device to quantitatively assess tremor characteristics in and outside the clinic. Methods: Study 1: Simulated pathological tremor was recorded simultaneously with a smart phone, a laser and an accelerometer. Time series of all devices were analysed offline and then compared to each other. Next, similar comparisons were performed using results obtained from online analysis of time series by algorithms integrated in the device. Study 2: Tremor of 12 patients (Parkinson's Disease, Essential Tremor and Multiple Sclerosis) and 6 healthy participants was recorded and analysed using a beta version of our smart phone application. Tremor was recorded in 3 different conditions: rest, postural and intention. Tremor amplitude obtained with the smart phone was then compared to scores obtained using a customdesigned clinical scale. Results: Study 1: Correlations between data from the smart phone and laboratory tools were high for amplitude, median power frequency and power distribution of the spectral tremor characteristics (r>0.92). However, power dispersion characteristics were affected by a floor effect that influenced the correlation coefficient. Correlations between data analysed by our usual algorithms performed on computer and the algorithms implemented within the smart phone were very high (r>0.96). Study 2: Tremor amplitude obtained with the smart phone was highly correlated with clinical scores (r>0.85). Moreover, spectral data allowed us to identify a prominent peak in patients with higher tremor amplitude. Conclusions: Smart phones are sensitive enough to detect and quantify pathological tremor. Moreover, it is possible to perform complex spectral analyses directly on the smart phone, allowing for more powerful assessment of pathological tremors.",Conference Abstract,10.1002/MDS.25051,http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=08853185&id=doi:10.1002%2Fmds.25051&atitle=Identifying+different+pathological+tremor+characteristics+with+a+smart+phone&stitle=Mov.+Disord.&title=Movement+Disorders&volume=27&issue=&spage=S407&epage=S408&aulast=Carignan&aufirst=B.&auinit=B.&aufull=Carignan+B.&coden=&isbn=&pages=S407-S408&date=2012&auinit1=B&auinitm=,Embase,Yes,,,no,Abstract,,Abstract only,

Body-worn sensors housing gyroscopes and accelerometers collect objective clinic-based gait and balance data. We previously demonstrated that these sensors distinguish people with mild MS from healthy controls when standard timed tests could not (Spain et al, Gait Posture 2012). Objective: This study compares the abilities of body-worn sensors versus stopwatch-timed tests to reliably capture gait and balance changes in people with MS over 18 months. Methods: MS subjects with normal walking speeds (N=31) and age- and sex-matched control subjects (N=19) were tested using wireless sensors on the lower legs, lumbar back, sternum and wrists for the Timed Up and Go test and during 30-second trials of quiet stance with eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC). Fifty gait and 42 sway metrics were calculated using automated software. Clinical tests included the Timed 25 Foot Walk (T25FW), and self-rated disability, gait and balance questionnaires. Tests were repeated at 6 month intervals for 18 months. To assess longitudinal changes in objective measures and group differences, we performed a linear mixed model analysis. Results: Gait and balance parameters (e.g. excessive postural sway area EC, reduced jerkiness of sway EC, excessive trunk rotation during gait) that distinguished mild MS from controls at the baseline visit continued to do so for most follow-up visits. Parameters most consistently distinguishing MS from controls related primarily to balance (p values from each visit demonstrating significant group differences): sway range EC (0.01, 0.001, 0.03, 0.007), sway area ratio EO/EC (0.004, 0.004, 0.05, 0.02), and normalized Jerk EC (0.04, 0.03, 0.02). Stride velocity during gait (0.02, 0.05) and sway area EC (0.007, 0.02) less consistently distinguished MS from controls. The T25FW failed to separate MS from controls at all time points. While no parameter worsened over time using group analysis, one subgroup improved while another worsened. Further subgroup analysis will determine which subjects improved versus worsened over time. Conclusions: Body-worn sensors consistently distinguished mild MS from controls over 18 months while stopwatch-timed tests could not. The availability of small, wireless, body-worn sensors may provide sensitive, reliable and feasible outcome measures for clinical trials and practice.",Conference Abstract,10.1177/1352458512459021,http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13524585&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458512459021&atitle=Longitudinal+measures+of+instrumented+gait+and+balance+in+multiple+sclerosis+over+18+months&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=18&issue=4&spage=330&epage=331&aulast=Spain&aufirst=R.&auinit=R.&aufull=Spain+R.&coden=&isbn=&pages=330-331&date=2012&auinit1=R&auinitm=,Embase,Yes,,,no,Abstract,,Abstract only,

Method: The samples included 18 persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) from Study 1 and 20 from Study 2 who were randomized into treatment arms of the intervention. The participants initially wore an accelerometer over a 7-day period for collection of baseline data, and one week later wore a pedometer over a 7-day period for collection of data for self-monitoring and goal setting in week 1 of the 12-week intervention. The accelerometer and pedometer data were both expressed in average steps per day over a 7-day period. Results: There was a moderate (d = .56), statistically significant (p = .03) difference of 1,822 steps per day between baseline and week 1 of the intervention in Study 1.

However, in the literature there are only a few papers that address this disorder. The aim of this study is to identify objectively subclinical abnormal gait strategies in these patients. Methods: Eleven patients affected by self-reported unsteadiness during gait (4 TBI and 7 MS) and ten healthy subjects underwent gait analysis while walking back and forth on a 15-m long corridor. Time-distance parameters, ankle sagittal motion, and muscular activity during gait were acquired by a wearable gait analysis system (Step32, DemItalia, Italy) on a high number of successive strides in the same walk and statistically processed. Both self-selected gait speed and high speed were tested under relatively unconstrained conditions. Non-parametric statistical analysis (Mann-Whitney, Wilcoxon tests) was carried out on the means of the data of the two examined groups. Results: The main findings, with data adjusted for velocity of progression, show that increased double support and reduced velocity of progression are the main parameters to discriminate patients with self-reported unsteadiness from healthy controls. Muscular intervals of activation showed a significant increase in the activity duration of the Rectus Femoris and Tibialis Anterior in patients with respect to the control group at high speed. Conclusions: Patients with a subjective sensation of instability, not clinically documented, walk with altered strategies, especially at high gait speed. This is thought to depend on the mechanisms of postural control and coordination. The gait anomalies detected might explain the symptoms reported by the patients and allow for a more focused treatment design. The wearable gait analysis system used for long distance statistical walking assessment was able to detect subtle differences in functional performance monitoring, otherwise not detectable by common clinical examinations.",Article,10.1186/1743-0003-9-64,WOS:000310270200001,WoS,Yes,,,no,,,included,

Consequently, more attention is geared towards their potential use in research and medical settings. For instance, their built-in hardware can provide quantitative data for different movements. Therefore, the goal of the current study was to evaluate the capabilities of a standalone smart phone platform to characterize tremor. RESULTS: Algorithms for tremor recording and online analysis can be implemented within a smart phone. The smart phone provides reliable time- and frequency-domain tremor characteristics. The smart phone can also provide medically-relevant tremor assessments. DISCUSSION: Smart phones have the potential to provide researchers and clinicians with quantitative short- and long-term tremor assessments that are currently not easily available. METHODS: A smart phone application for tremor quantification and online analysis was developed. Then, smart phone results were compared to those obtained simultaneously with a laboratory accelerometer. Finally, results from the smart phone were compared to clinical tremor assessments. © 2012 Daneault, Carignan, Codère, Sadikot and Duval.",Article,10.3389/FNHUM.2012.00357,http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=16625161&id=doi:10.3389%2Ffnhum.2012.00357&atitle=Using+a+smart+phone+as+a+standalone+platform+for+detection+and+monitoring+of+pathological+tremors&stitle=Front.+Human+Neurosci.&title=Frontiers+in+Human+Neuroscience&volume=&issue=DEC&spage=1&epage=31&aulast=Daneault&aufirst=Jean-Fran%C3%A7ois&auinit=J.&aufull=Daneault+J.&coden=&isbn=&pages=1-31&date=2012&auinit1=J&auinitm=,Embase,No,Out of scope (outcomes)/Teamdiscussion,,yes,,,included,

Disability status and progression are associated with reduced physical activity (PA) and cardiovascular function. Lack of adequate PA combined with inflammation may create high susceptibility to subclinical atherosclerosis and vascular dysfunction. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to compare subclinical atherosclerosis and arterial function between individuals with and without MS matched for age, sex, and body mass index. Methods: Thirty-three individuals diagnosed with MS and 33 controls underwent strain gauge plethysmography for resting forearm blood flow (FBF) and peak reactive hyperemia for the microvascular function. Intima-media thickness and arterial compliance (AC) were measured using carotid ultrasound for vascular function. C-reactive protein and PA (7-d accelerometer data) were also measured. Results: There was a significant difference (P G 0.05) in resting FBF, peak reactive hyperemia, central pulse wave velocity, and AC between the MS and control groups. PA was associated with peak FBF and central pulse wave velocity but not FBF and carotid AC. Individuals with MS exhibit reduced arterial function but similar intima-media thickness compared with controls. Persons with MS had significantly reduced PA levels compared with controls, and PA accounted for differences in arterial function between groups. Conclusions: These results indicate that subclinical markers of atherosclerosis are higher in individuals with MS, suggesting a higher risk of cardiovascular disease in this population. However, the higher levels of subclinical atherosclerosis were accounted for by the low PA in persons with MS, suggesting that increasing PA may reduce the increase in cardiovascular disease risk in patients with MS.

This study examined the effect of weight status on mobility using a comprehensive set of mobility outcomes including ambulatory performance (timed 25-foot walk, T25FW; 6-minute walk, 6MW; oxygen cost of walking, C w; spatiotemporal parameters of gait; self-reported walking impairment, Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale-12 (MSWS-12); and free-living activity, accelerometry) in 168 ambulatory persons with MS. Mean (SD) BMI was 27.7 (5.1) kg/ m 2. Of the 168 participants, 31.0% were classified as normal weight (BMI = 18.5-24.9 kg/ m 2), 36.3% were classified as overweight (BMI = 25.0-29.9 kg/ m 2), and 32.7% were classified as obese, classes I and II (BMI = 30-39.9 kg/ m 2). There were no significant differences among BMI groups on T25FW and 6MW, C w, spatiotemporal gait parameters, MSWS-12, or daily step and movement counts. The prevalence of overweight and obesity in this sample was almost 70%, but there was not a consistent nor significant impact of BMI on outcomes of mobility.

Local Dynamic Stability (LDS), a non-linear gait stability index, has been advocated as an early indicator of risk for falls. With this longitudinal study over three weeks, we aimed to assess the responsiveness of Local Dynamic Stability to a rehabilitation program and to compare it to other measures. Eighteen patients (mean 54 years, median EDSS score: 5) participated. They were admitted to inpatient rehabilitation and received a three weeks individually tailored program. They performed a 3-minute walking test at the beginning and at the end of the stay, as well as pain, wellbeing, fatigue, and balance assessment. The Local Dynamic Stability was computed from the acceleration signals measured with a 3D-accelerometer. At the end of the rehabilitation process, patients reported reduced pain (Effect Size: -0.7), fatigue (ES:-0.6), and increased wellbeing (ES: 1.1). A small positive effect on static balance was observed (ES: 0.3). LDS was improved (ES: 0.6), and the effect was higher than walking speed improvement (ES: 0.4).

Objective: This study aimed to determine the relation between real-life arm performance and clinical tests in MS. Methods: Thirty wheelchair-bound MS patients and 30 healthy controls were included. Actual and perceived real-life arm performance was measured by using accelerometry and a self-reported measure (Motor Activity Log). Clinical tests on 'body functions and structures' (JAMAR handgrip strength, Motricity Index (MI), Fugl Meyer (FM)) and 'activity' level (Nine Hole Peg Test (NHPT), Action Research Arm test) of the International Classification of Functioning were conducted. Statistical analyses were performed separately for current dominant and non-dominant arm. Results: For all outcome measures, MS patients scored with both arms significantly lower than the control group. Higher correlations between actual arm performance and clinical tests were found for the non-dominant arm (0.63-0.80). The FM (55%) was a good predictor of actual arm performance, while the MI (46%) and NHPT (55%) were good predictors of perceived arm performance. Conclusions: Real-life arm performance is decreased in wheelchair-bound MS patients and can be best predicted by measures on 'body functions and structures' level and fine motor control.

A Reliability and Comparison Study in Healthy Individuals and in Patients with Paresis of the Lower Extremities,PLOS ONE,2014,"Falls while walking are frequent in patients with muscular dysfunction resulting from neurological disorders. Falls induce injuries that may lead to deconditioning and disabilities, which further increase the risk of falling. Therefore, an early gait stability index would be useful to evaluate patients in order to prevent the occurrence of future falls. Derived from chaos theory, local dynamic stability (LDS), defined by the maximal Lyapunov exponent, assesses the sensitivity of a dynamic system to small perturbations. LDS has already been used for fall risk prediction in elderly people. The aim of the present study was to provide information to facilitate future researches regarding gait stability in patients with neurological gait disorders. The main objectives were 1) to evaluate the intra-session repeatability of LDS in patients and 2) to assess the discriminative power of LDS to differentiate between healthy individuals and neurological patients. Eighty-three patients with mild to moderate neurological disorders associated with paresis of the lower extremities and 40 healthy controls participated in the study. The participants performed 2x30 s walking wearing a 3D accelerometer attached to the lower back, from which 2x35 steps were extracted. LDS was defined as the average exponential rate of divergence among trajectories in a reconstructed state-space that reflected the gait dynamics. LDS assessed along the medio-lateral axis offered the highest repeatability and discriminative power. Intra-session repeatability (intraclass correlation coefficient between the two repetitions) in the patients was 0.89 and the smallest detectable difference was 16%. LDS was substantially lower in the patients than in the controls (33% relative difference, standardized effect size 2.3). LDS measured in short over-ground walking tests seems sufficiently reliable. LDS exhibits good discriminative power to differentiate fall-prone individuals and opens up the possibility of future clinical applications for better prediction of fall risk in neurological patients.",Article,10.1371/JOURNAL.PONE.0100550,WOS:000338276300089,WoS,Yes,,,no,Out of scope,,included,

There are several studies about factors affecting physical activity in pwMS. However, these factors have not investigated in minimally impaired pwMS [Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores 0-3.5] who do not have remarkable symptoms and walking disturbance. Objectives: The objective was to determine factors affecting physical activity in minimally impaired pwMS. Methods: Fifty two minimally impaired pwMS (EDSS scores between 0 and 3.5) participated in this cross-sectional study. Physical activity was measured with Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ) and an accelerometer which was used for the 7-day period. Demographic data such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), and employment status were recorded. Disability level, walking, fatigue, depression, cognitive function and quality of life were measured. Results: Accelerometer counts were correlated with Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT) (r=0.29, p< 0.05) employment status (r=0.28, p< 0.05), BMI (r=0.34, p< 0.05), and gender (r=0.40, p< .005).

Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: University medical center. Participants: Persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) (n=40) were compared with similar aged control subjects (n=20). There were 20 subjects with MS in the normal walking velocity group and 20 subjects with MS who had slow walking velocity based on a timed 25-foot walk (T25FW) of <5 seconds. Interventions: None. Main Outcome Measures: Postural response latency, sway variables, trunk motion variables. Results: We found that subjects with MS with both slow or normal walking velocities had significantly longer postural response latencies than the healthy control group. Postural response latency was not correlated with the T25FW. Postural response latency was significantly correlated with center of pressure sway variables during quiet standing (root mean square: rho=.334, P=.04; range: rho=.385, P=.017; mean velocity: rho=.337, P=.038; total sway area: rho=.393, P=.015). Postural response latency was also significantly correlated with motion of the trunk during walking (sagittal plane range of motion: rho=.316, P=.05; SD of transverse plane range of motion: rho=-.43, P=.006). Conclusions: These findings clearly indicate that slow postural responses to external perturbations in patients with MS contribute to disturbances in balance control during both standing and walking.

This study examined the validity of those MCID values based on capturing corresponding changes in other walking outcomes in persons with multiple sclerosis (MS). Methods: On 2 occasions separated by 6 months, 82 persons with MS completed the MSWS-12, timed 25-ft walk (T25FW), 6-min walk (6MW), and gait analysis, and then wore an accelerometer over a 7-day period. We generated change scores for the MSWS-12 and formed groups of stable, worsened, and improved perceived walking based on both 4- and 6-point changes. The groups were compared for corresponding changes in other walking measures over time using mixed-model ANOVAs. Results: The mixed-model ANOVAs did not identify statistically significant group-by-time interactions on the T25FW (p = 0.98 and p = 0.67), the 6MW (p = 0.89 and p = 0.72), gait (p = 0.54 and p = 0.21), or accelerometry (p = 0.40 and p = 0.68) for MCID values of 4- or 6-point changes in MSWS-12 scores.

The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a novel inertial sensor system for ambulatory behavior and joint motion measurement in the everyday environment. An algorithm for behavior classification, step detection, and knee angle calculation was developed. The validation protocol consisted of simulated daily activities in a laboratory environment. The tests were performed with ten healthy subjects and eleven patients with multiple sclerosis. Activity classification showed comparable performance to commercially available activPAL sensors. Step detection with our sensor system was more accurate. The calculated flexion-extension angle of the knee joint showed a root mean square error of less than 5° compared with results obtained using an electro-mechanical goniometer. This new system combines ambulatory behavior assessment and knee angle measurement for long-term measurement periods in a home environment.

Accelerometric (ACC) and electromyographic (EMG) recordings were performed in 26 MS patients complaining of clumsiness, associated (n= 16) or not associated (n= 10) with visible tremor. Seventeen healthy subjects with physiological tremor (PT) and eight patients with essential tremor (ET) served as controls. Signals were analyzed using non-linear Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and related Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT), compared to the standard linear spectral analysis using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The presence of cerebellar signs and motor deficit was assessed on clinical examination. Using FFT, tremor was found in all patients with ET and 12% of subjects with PT, but in none of the MS patients, even in the presence of visible tremor. In contrast, EMD-HHT analysis of ACC-EMG coupling showed common frequency peaks characterizing tremor related to a central generator in 62.5% of MS patients with visible tremor, 40% of MS patients without visible tremor, 29% of subjects with PT, and all patients with ET. In EMD-HHT analysis, tremor characteristics were similar in subjects with PT and MS patients, regardless of the presence of a visible tremor, but these characteristics clearly differed in patients with ET. A visible tremor in MS patients was associated with more frequent cerebellar signs and less motor deficit at the upper limb. The low-frequency tremor observed in MS patients could therefore originate in lesions of the brainstem (midbrain) or cerebellothalamic circuits, or may correspond to an enhanced PT, partly favored by cerebellar dysfunction and being more visible during movement execution in the absence of concomitant motor deficit.",Article,10.1016/J.NEUCLI.2015.09.013,http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=17697131&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.neucli.2015.09.013&atitle=Analysis+of+tremor+in+multiple+sclerosis+using+Hilbert-Huang+Transform&stitle=Neurophysiol.+Clin.&title=Neurophysiologie+Clinique&volume=45&issue=6&spage=475&epage=484&aulast=Ayache&aufirst=S.-S.&auinit=S.-S.&aufull=Ayache+S.-S.&coden=NCLIE&isbn=&pages=475-484&date=2015&auinit1=S&auinitm=-S,Embase,Yes,,,no,Out of scope,,Out of scope (outcomes),

Methods: Thirty-eight participant pairs (MS and cohabitant) aged 18-55 years participated in the study. Each participant received an Android HTC Sensation 4G smartphone containing a custom application suite of 19 tests capturing participant performance and patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Over 1 year, participants were prompted daily to complete one assigned test. Results: A total of 22 patients with MS and 17 cohabitants completed the entire study. Among patients with MS, low scores on PROs relating tomental and visual function were associated with dropout (p < 0.05). We illustrate several novel features of a smartphone platform. First, fluctuations in MS outcomes (e.g., fatigue) were assessed against an individual's ambient environment by linking responses to meteorological data. Second, both response accuracy and speed for the Ishihara color vision test were captured, highlighting the benefits of both active and passive data collection. Third, a new trait, a person-specific learning curve in neuropsychological testing, was identified using spline analysis. Finally, averaging repeated measures over the study yielded the most robust correlation matrix of the different outcome measures.

Objectives: To determine the prevalence and severity of fatigue in persons with subacute spinal cord injury (SCI), assess whether demographic and lesion characteristics are related to fatigue and determine the relationship with physical fitness and physical behavior. Setting: Measurements were performed 2 months before discharge from inpatient rehabilitation. Methods: Thirty-six persons with subacute SCI, dependent on a manual wheelchair, mean age 43 +/- 15 and 83% men, completed the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). FSS scores 44 indicated fatigue. We recorded age and lesion characteristics, measured body mass index, measured peak power output and peak oxygen uptake during a maximal handcycling test and determined physical behavior using an accelerometer-based activity monitor. T-tests were used to test for differences in fatigue between subgroups based on age and lesion characteristics, and regression analyses to assess the relationship with physical fitness and physical behavior. Results: Mean FSS was 3.3 +/- 1.3. Fatigue, including severe fatigue, was prevalent in 31% (95% confidence interval: 16-46) of participants compared with 18% in the general population. Furthermore, mean fatigue was significantly higher in persons with incomplete compared with complete lesions (t=2.22, P=0.03). Mean scores between other subgroups did not differ significantly. Of the physical fitness and physical behavior measures, only peak oxygen uptake tended to be related to more fatigue (B=-1.47, P=0.05). Conclusion: Fatigue was prevalent and is of concern in persons with subacute SCI. Those with incomplete lesions seem to be at higher risk. Because fatigue is known to persist among persons with SCI, interventions to reduce fatigue seem necessary.",Article,10.1038/SC.2015.66,WOS:000362459000009,WoS,Yes,,,no,Out of scope,,Out of scope (topic),not MS

This paper describes a method to extract upper limb intention tremor from gyroscope data, through the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT), a technique suitable for the study of nonlinear and non-stationary processes. The aims of the study were to: (i) evaluate the method's ability to discriminate between healthy controls and MS subjects; (ii) validate the proposed procedure against clinical tremor scores assigned using Fahn's tremor rating scale (FTRS); and (iii) compare the performance of the HHT-based method with that of linear band-pass filters. Approach. HHT was applied on gyroscope data collected on 20 MS subjects and 13 healthy controls (CO) during finger-to-nose tests (FNTs) instrumented with an inertial sensor placed on the hand. The results were compared to those obtained after traditional linear filtering. The tremor amplitude was quantified with instrumental indexes (TIs) and clinical FTRS ratings. Main results. The TIs computed after HHT-based filtering discriminated between CO and MS subjects with clinically-detected intention tremor (MS-T). In particular, TIs were significantly higher in the final part of the movement (TI<inf>2</inf>) with respect to the first part (TI<inf>1</inf>), and, for all components (X, Y, Z), MS-T showed a TI<inf>2</inf> significantly higher than in CO subjects. Moreover, the HHT detected subtle alterations not visible from clinical ratings, as TI<inf>2</inf> (Z-component) was significantly increased in MS subjects without clinically-detected tremor (MS-NT). The method's validity was demonstrated by significant correlations between clinical FTRS scores and TI<inf>2</inf> related to X (r<inf>s</inf> = 0.587, p = 0.006) and Y (r<inf>s</inf> = 0.682, p < 0.001) components. Contrarily, fewer differences among the groups and no correlation between instrumental and clinical indexes emerged after traditional filtering. Significance. The present results supported the use of the HHT-based procedure for a fully-automated quantitative and objective measure of intention tremor in MS, which can overcome the limitations of clinical scales and provide supplementary information about this sign.",Article,10.1088/1741-2560/12/4/046011,http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=17412552&id=doi:10.1088%2F1741-2560%2F12%2F4%2F046011&atitle=Hilbert-Huang+transform+based+instrumental+assessment+of+intention+tremor+in+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=J.+Neural+Eng.&title=Journal+of+Neural+Engineering&volume=12&issue=4&spage=&epage=&aulast=Carpinella&aufirst=Ilaria&auinit=I.&aufull=Carpinella+I.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2015&auinit1=I&auinitm=,Embase,Yes,,,no,Out of scope,,included,tremor hand acc correlated with FTRS

About 1/5 will eventually receive a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS). Up to 3/4 of children with MS suffer from depression, fatigue, and/or cognitive impairment. Previous studies in healthy adolescents and adults with MS have shown physical activity (PA) to benefit cognition and psychosocial outcomes. Investigating PA may help in the development of non-pharmacologic interventions for symptom management in pediatric MS. Goals: To investigate: (1) PA levels in youth with monophasic ADS (mono-ADS) and MS in comparison to healthy controls (HC); (2) The associations of PA levels in youth with MS wh experience fatigue and depression. Methods: 74 consecutive patients were recruited from the Neuroinflammatory Clinic at the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada (25 MS, 49 mono-ADS). 45 HC were recruited by flyers/word of mouth. Accelerometry (7 days), PA (Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ)), fatigue (PedsQL MFS) and depression (CES-DC) questionnaires were completed by all participants. SickKids research ethics approval was obtained. Results: MS participants (15.7±1.9 yo) were older than mono- ADS (13.7±2.6; p=0.001) and HC (14.4±2.4; p=0.03) participants. The proportion of females was not different across groups (p=0.14). Accelerometer data showed lower vigorous PA in the MS group (0.07±1.5 min/d) than in the mono-ADS (3.3±5.6 min/d; p=0.006) and HC (5.6±5.0 min/d; p=0.004) groups. On the GLTEQ, indicated MS patients compared with mono-ADS patients participated in lower levels of strenuous (17±18 vs. 30±21 METs, p=0.01) and total (42±29 vs. 63±32 METs, p=0.02) PA. Results remained after controlling for age. No differences were found in fatigue or depression between the groups. For the MS group, fatigue was correlated with depression (r=0.76) and vigorous PA was negatively correlated with fatigue (r=-0.53) and depression (r=-0.54). Conclusions: Youth with MS participate in less vigorous/strenuous PA than their mono-ADS and HC counterparts. Those who participate in higher levels of vigorous PA report fewer depressive and fatigue symptoms. This study is limited by its crosssectional nature, therefore, directionality of this association is unknown. Future investigations should focus on interventions that will help increase the amount of vigorous/strenuous PA as this may have the potential to ameliorate depression and fatigue in youth with MS.",Conference Abstract,10.1177/1352458515602642,http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13524585&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458515602642&atitle=Low+levels+of+participation+in+vigorous+physical+activity+in+youth+with+multiple+sclerosis+and+the+associations+with+fatigue+and+depression&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=23&issue=11&spage=379&epage=380&aulast=Grover&aufirst=S.A.&auinit=S.A.&aufull=Grover+S.A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=379-380&date=2015&auinit1=S&auinitm=A,Embase,Yes,,,no,Out of scope,youth population,included,accelerometer used as outcome measure

Design Randomized controlled trial, 3-month postintervention follow-up. Setting Home and general community, and university research laboratory. Participants Nonambulatory individuals with MS (N=14; mean age ± SD, 53.6±8.7y) were randomly assigned to an intervention group (IG) or a control group (CG). Interventions After baseline testing, the IG participants received custom-fit, ultralightweight manual wheelchairs with propulsion/skills training, followed by 3 months of at-home use with the custom ultralightweight wheelchair and weekly phone calls to deliver support through a multifactorial intervention. The CG participants received no training and used their own wheelchairs at home during this time. Main Outcome Measures All subjects were assessed at baseline and 3 months later for fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale), upper extremity strength (digital handheld dynamometer), and propulsion technique (on a treadmill [0.5m/s] with instrumented wheels). Two 1-week bouts of physical activity were measured in both groups from home with wrist-worn accelerometry at the beginning (IG and CG in own wheelchairs) and end (IG in study wheelchair, CG in own) of the 3-month period of home use. Results The intervention was well tolerated, and no adverse events were reported. The IG demonstrated increased strength (P=.008) and a trend toward less fatigue (P=.068), both with large effect sizes (d>0.8), as well as reduced application of braking torque during propulsion (P=.003) with a moderate/large effect size (d=.73), compared with the CG.

Recent advances in inexpensive, wireless sensor technology and smart devices are resulting in an explosion of miniature, portable sensors that can quickly and accurately quantify body motion. Practical and useful movement monitoring systems are now becoming available. It is critical that therapists understand the potential advantages and limitations of such emerging technology. One important advantage of obtaining objective measures of balance and gait from body-worn sensors is impairment-level metrics characterizing how and why functional performance of balance and gait activities are impaired. Therapy can then be focused on the specific physiological reasons for difficulty in walking or balancing during specific tasks. A second advantage of using technology to measure balance and gait behavior is the increased sensitivity of the balance and gait measures to document mild disability and change with rehabilitation. A third advantage of measuring movement, such as postural sway and gait characteristics, with body-worn sensors is the opportunity for immediate biofeedback provided to patients that can focus attention and enhance performance. In the future, body-worn sensors may allow therapists to perform telerehabilitation to monitor compliance with home exercise programs and the quality of their natural mobility in the community. Therapists need technological systems that are quick to use and provide actionable information and useful reports for their patients and referring physicians. Therapists should look for systems that provide measures that have been validated with respect to gold standard accuracy and to clinically relevant outcomes such as fall risk and severity of disability.",Article,10.2522/PTJ.20140253,WOS:000350266800017,WoS,No,Out of scope (topic),,yes,,,Review,

However, gait variability's link to falls in persons with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS) is not well established. This investigation examined the relationship between stride-time variability, fall risk, and physiological fall risk factors in PwMS. 17 PwMS (62.8±7.4 years) and 17 age-matched controls (62.8±5.9 years) performed the 6-minute walk test. Stride-time was assessed with accelerometers attached to the participants' shanks. Stride-time variability was measured by interstride coefficient of variation (CV) of stride-time. The participant's fall risk was measured by the short form physiological profile assessment (PPA). A Spearman correlation analysis was used to determine the relationship between variables. Increased fall risk was strongly associated with increased stride-time CV in both PwMS (?=0.71, p<0.01) and the controls (?=0.67, p<0.01). Fall risk was not correlated with average stride-time (p>0.05). In PwMS, stride-time CV was related to postural sway (?=0.74, p<0.01) while in the control group, it was related to proprioception (?=0.61, p<0.01) and postural sway (?=0.78, p<0.01). Current observations suggest that gait variability is maybe more sensitive marker of fall risk than average gait parameters in PwMS.

357,"Lee, H; Hogan, N",Time-Varying Ankle Mechanical Impedance During Human Locomotion,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING,2015,"In human locomotion, we continuously modulate joint mechanical impedance of the lower limb (hip, knee, and ankle) either voluntarily or reflexively to accommodate environmental changes and maintain stable interaction. Ankle mechanical impedance plays a pivotal role at the interface between the neuro-mechanical system and the physical world. This paper reports, for the first time, a characterization of human ankle mechanical impedance in two degrees-of-freedom simultaneously as it varies with time during walking. Ensemble-based linear time-varying system identification methods implemented with a wearable ankle robot, Anklebot, enabled reliable estimation of ankle mechanical impedance from the pre-swing phase through the entire swing phase to the early-stance phase. This included heel-strike and toe-off, key events in the transition from the swing to stance phase or vice versa. Time-varying ankle mechanical impedance was accurately approximated by a second order model consisting of inertia, viscosity, and stiffness in both inversion-eversion and dorsiflexion-plantarflexion directions, as observed in our previous steady-state dynamic studies. We found that viscosity and stiffness of the ankle significantly decreased at the end of the stance phase before toe-off, remained relatively constant across the swing phase, and increased around heel-strike. Closer investigation around heel-strike revealed that viscosity and stiffness in both planes increased before heel-strike occurred.

However, its underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain poorly understood. Our aim was to assess the potential role of the cerebellum and brainstemstructures in the generation ofMS tremor. We performed accelerometric (ACC) and electromyographic (EMG) assessment of tremor in 32MS patientswithmanual clumsiness. In addition to clinical examination, patients underwent a neurophysiological exploration of the brainstemand cerebellar functions,which consisted of blink and masseter inhibitory reflexes, cerebello-thalamo-cortical inhibition (CTCi), and somatosensory evoked potentials. Tremor was clinically visible in 18 patients and absent in 14. Patients with visible tremor had more severe score of ataxia and clinical signs of cerebellar dysfunction, as well as a more reduced CTCi on neurophysiological investigation. However, ACC and EMG recordings confirmed the presence of a real rhythmic activity in only one patient. In most MS patients, the clinically visible tremor corresponded to a pseudorhythmic activity without coupling between ACC and EMG recordings. Cerebellar dysfunction may contribute to the occurrence of this pseudorhythmic activity mimicking tremor during posture and movement execution.",Article,10.1016/J.JNS.2015.09.360,http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=18785883&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.jns.2015.09.360&atitle=Tremor+in+multiple+sclerosis%3A+The+intriguing+role+of+the+cerebellum&stitle=J.+Neurol.+Sci.&title=Journal+of+the+Neurological+Sciences&volume=358&issue=1-2&spage=351&epage=356&aulast=Ayache&aufirst=Samar+S.&auinit=S.S.&aufull=Ayache+S.S.&coden=JNSCA&isbn=&pages=351-356&date=2015&auinit1=S&auinitm=S,Embase,Yes,,,no,Out of scope,,included,

Robot-mediated training in a virtual reality context can be applied to enhance rehabilitation of the arm by increasing training intensity. Aims: The aim of the current study was to evaluate upper limb capacity and perception of arm function after individualized adaptive robot-mediated I-TRAVLE training. Methods: In this single arm cohort study, PwMS trained the most impaired arm with the I-TRAVLE system and Haptic Master robot, during eight consecutive weeks at a frequency of five training sessions of twice 30 minutes per 2 weeks. By means of combined quantitative and qualitative assessment, arm function was evaluated at baseline, directly after training and at 3 months of follow-up. In addition to clinical outcome measures at different ICF levels (active range of motion, motricity index, Jamar handgrip strength, Wolf motor function test, ABILHAND and manual ability measure), perceived arm function in terms of fatigue and strength was assessed using a visual analogue scale. Every 2 weeks during training, an interview on motivation, training expectancy and potential training goals was conducted. One month after training, a focus group was organized concerning subjective experience of arm (dys)function, robot-mediated training and changes during and after training. Results: Nine women and four men (aged 22-66 years) with a median Expanded Disability Status Scale score of 6.5 (interquartile range (IQR) 5-7.5) completed the training. Median maximum and sustained active range of motion of shoulder anteflexion increased from 110 (IQR 97-132) to 137 (IQR 112-144) and from 102 (IQR 92-120) to 129 (IQR 100-138), respectively. Other clinical outcome measures on the function level did not demonstrate significant improvement and no changes on perceived performance were reported. However, median perceived fatigue of the arm decreased from 3.6 (IQR 1.8-5.1) to 1.7 (IQR 0.7-5.6) while median perceived strength improved from 3.9 (IQR 3.0-4.6) to 7.4 (IQR 5.1-8.6). During the focus group, patients mentioned increased arm use and improvements in motor control during sustained motor activities. Analysis of robot and accelerometry data confirm these findings. Conclusions: Although not all quantitative measures could demonstrate improvement after training, qualitative analysis showed improved movement performance in daily life.

Substantial cost, space, time to administer, and need for trained personnel limit widespread use of biomechanical techniques in the assessment of postural stability in clinical or field environments. Objective: To determine whether accelerometer and gyroscope data sampled from a consumer electronics device (iPad2) provide sufficient resolution of center-of-gravity (COG) movements to accurately quantify postural stability in healthy young people. Design: Controlled laboratory study. Setting: Research laboratory in an academic medical center. Patients or Other Participants: A total of 49 healthy individuals (age = 19.5 +/- 3.1 years, height = 167.7 +/- 13.2 cm, mass = 68.5 +/- 17.5 kg). Intervention(s): Participants completed the NeuroCom Sensory Organization Test (SOT) with an iPad2 affixed at the sacral level. Main Outcome Measure(s): Primary outcomes were equilibrium scores from both systems and the time series of the angular displacement of the anteroposterior COG sway during each trial. A Bland-Altman assessment for agreement was used to compare equilibrium scores produced by the NeuroCom and iPad2 devices. Limits of agreement was defined as the mean bias (NeuroCom - iPad) +/- 2 standard deviations. Mean absolute percentage error and median difference between the NeuroCom and iPad2 measurements were used to evaluate how closely the real-time COG sway measured by the 2 systems tracked each other. Results: The limits between the 2 devices ranged from -0.5 degrees to 0.5 degrees in SOT condition 1 to -2.9 degrees to 1.3 degrees in SOT condition 5. The largest absolute value of the measurement error within the 95% confidence intervals for all conditions was 2.9 degrees. The mean absolute percentage error analysis indicated that the iPad2 tracked NeuroCom COG with an average error ranging from 5.87% to 10.42% of the NeuroCom measurement across SOT conditions. Conclusions: The iPad2 hardware provided data of sufficient precision and accuracy to quantify postural stability.

Objectives: This study examined the association between rates of energy expenditure (that is, oxygen consumption (VO2)) and accelerometer counts (that is, vector magnitude (VM)) across a range of speeds during manual wheelchair propulsion on a motor-driven treadmill. Such an association allows for the generation of cutoff points for quantifying the time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) during manual wheelchair propulsion. Setting: The study was conducted in the University Laboratory. Methods: Twenty-four manual wheelchair users completed a 6-min period of seated rest and three 6-min periods of manual wheelchair propulsion on a motor-driven wheelchair treadmill. The 6-min periods of wheelchair propulsion corresponded with three treadmill speeds (1.5, 3.0 and 4.5 mph) that elicited a range of physical activity intensities. Participants wore a portable metabolic unit and accelerometers on both wrists. Primary outcome measures included steady-state VO2 and VM, and the strength of association between VO2 and VM was based on the multiple correlation and squared multiple correlation coefficients from linear regression analyses. Results: Strong linear associations were established between VO2 and VM for the left (R=0.93 +/- 0.44; R-2=0.87 +/- 0.19), right (R=0.95 +/- 0.37; R-2=0.90 +/- 0.14) and combined (R=0.94 +/- 0.38; R-2=0.88 +/- 0.15) accelerometers. The linear relationship between VO2 and VM for the left, right and combined wrists yielded cutoff points for MVPA of 3659 +/- 1302, 3630 +/- 1403 and 3644 +/- 1339 counts min(-1), respectively. Conclusion: We provide cutoff points based on the linear association between energy expenditure and accelerometer counts for estimating time spent in MVPA during manual wheelchair propulsion using wrist-worn accelerometry.

The impact on habitual mobility and its correlation with clinical tests has not been analysed. Objective To investigate the association between clinical response criteria and habitual mobility in MS patients starting a fampridine treatment. Methods During a four-week baseline-to-treatment study, we assessed in 28 patients (median EDSS 4.75, range 46.5) walking tests as the Timed-25-Foot-Walk (T25FW) and mobility questionnaires at day 0, 14 (start of treatment) and 28. Habitual steps and distance per day, total activity and walking speed was measured by accelerometry over four weeks. Beside improvement in real-life mobility, we investigated if such measures differed between non-responders and responders defined by a 20% improvement in clinical tests. Results All clinical test, patient reported outcomes and total activity improved significantly (p < 0.05). 46% improved (any change > 0) in three of four real-life measures. Change of the T25FW predicted only an increase of distance per day. Subjective rating of patients performed better by predicting distance and walking speed changes correctly.

Self-reported fatigue is complex and multifactorial, with relatively little known about the causes and impacts among older people. This study tested the association between fatigue and objectively measured physical activity in a large cohort of older adults and identified factors that may explain this association. Methods: Using cross-sectional data from 980 community-living 70- to 77-year-olds, the associations between self-reported fatigue and four physical activity outcomes derived from an accelerometer-based activity monitor were tested. Attenuating effects on the association of age, gender, body mass index (BMI), physical condition, comorbidity, depression, and sleep quality were evaluated. Results: Nine percent of the sample reported being fatigued. Fatigued individuals had 1,150 fewer steps/day, 9 minutes/day less of moderatevigorous activity, 12 minutes/day less of daily activity, and 15% fewer counts/minute, when compared with those not fatigued. BMI, physical condition, and comorbidity attenuated the association, and final regression models including these variables explained most (56%-72%) of the association between fatigue and activity. Conclusions: Fatigue was associated with clinically important reductions in daily physical activity levels of older people. The findings show BMI, physical condition (in particular cardiorespiratory fitness), and comorbidity to be important factors in explaining the fatigue-physical activity association. Modification of these factors may facilitate increases in daily activity levels by lessening fatigue.",Article,10.1093/GERONA/GLV150,WOS:000376398400017,WoS,Yes,,,no,Out of scope,,Out of scope (topic),not MS

However, many health benefits have not been realised because of issues with data quality that results from gravitational cross-talk when the wearable device is tilted. Here we present an adaptive filter designed to improve the quality of accelerometer data prior to measuring dynamic pelvic sway patterns during a six minute walk test in people with and without Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Optical motion capture was used as the gold standard. Improved wearable device accuracy (?4.4% NRMSE) was achieved using gyroscopic corrections and scaling filter thresholds by step frequency. The people with MS presented significantly greater pelvis sway range to compensate for their lower limb weaknesses and joint contractures. The visualisation of asymmetric pelvic sway in people with MS illustrates the potential to better understand their mobility impairments for reducing fall risk.",Article,10.1080/10255842.2016.1140747,http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14768259&id=doi:10.1080%2F10255842.2016.1140747&atitle=Gyroscopic+corrections+improve+wearable+sensor+data+prior+to+measuring+dynamic+sway+in+the+gait+of+people+with+Multiple+Sclerosis&stitle=Comput.+Methods+Biomech.+Biomed.+Eng.&title=Computer+Methods+in+Biomechanics+and+Biomedical+Engineering&volume=19&issue=12&spage=1339&epage=1346&aulast=Brodie&aufirst=Matthew+A.+D.&auinit=M.A.D.&aufull=Brodie+M.A.D.&coden=&isbn=&pages=1339-1346&date=2016&auinit1=M&auinitm=A.D.,Embase,No,Out of scope (outcomes)/Teamdiscussion,,yes,,,included,

For wearable devices that actively prevent falls or mitigate their consequences, a critical prerequisite is knowledge on the user's current state of balance. To keep such wearable systems practical and to achieve high acceptance, only very limited sensor instrumentation is possible, often restricted to inertial measurement units at waist level. We propose to augment this limited sensor information by combining it with additional knowledge on human gait, in the form of an observer concept. The observer contains a combination of validated concepts to model human gait: a spring-loaded inverted pendulum model with articulated upper body, where foot placement and stance leg are controlled via the extrapolated center of mass (XCoM) and the virtual pivot point (VPP), respectively. State estimation is performed via an Additive Unscented Kalman Filter (Additive UKF). We investigated sensitivity of the proposed concept to model uncertainties, and we evaluated observer performance with real data from human subjects walking on a treadmill. Data were collected from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) placed near the subject's center of mass (CoM), and observer estimates were compared to the ground truth as obtained via infrared motion capture. We found that the root mean squared deviation did not exceed 13 cm on position, 22 cm/s on velocity (0.56-1.35 m/s), 1.2 degrees on orientation, and 17 degrees/s on angular velocity.",Article,10.3389/FROBT.2016.00011,WOS:000382477000001,WoS,Yes,,,no,Out of scope,No MS patients,Out of scope (topic),not MS

Our objectives are: (1) to use IMU array data to calculate metrics that quantify performance (speed and stability) and (2) to investigate the effects of load on performance. We hypothesize that added load significantly decreases subject speed yet results in increased stability of subject movements. We propose and evaluate five performance metrics: (1) time to cross beam (less time = more speed), (2) percentage of total time spent in double support (more double support time = more stable), (3) stride duration (longer stride duration = more stable), (4) ratio of sacrum M-L to A-P acceleration (lower ratio = less lateral balance corrections = more stable), and (5) M-L torso range of motion (smaller range of motion = less balance corrections = more stable). We find that the total time to cross the beam increases with load (t = 4.85, p < 0.001). Stability metrics also change significantly with load, all indicating increased stability. In particular, double support time increases (t = 6.04, p < 0.001), stride duration increases (t = 3.436, p = 0.002), the ratio of sacrum acceleration RMS decreases (t = -5.56, p < 0.001), and the M-L torso lean range of motion decreases (t = -2.82, p = 0.009). Overall, the IMU array successfully measures subject movement and gait parameters that reveal the trade-off between speed and stability in this highly dynamic balance task. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

422,"Craig, JJ; Bruetsch, A; Huisinga, JM",Relationship between trunk and foot accelerations during walking in healthy adults,GAIT & POSTURE,2016,"Understanding upper body and lower body segment relationships may be an important step in assessing stability during gait. This study explored the relationship between acceleration patterns at the trunk and at the foot during treadmill walking at self-selected pace in healthy adults. Forty healthy subjects walked on a treadmill for 3 minutes at self-selected speed. Root mean square (RMS) and approximate entropy (ApEn) were derived from the acceleration time series at the trunk and at the foot in the frontal and sagittal plane. RMS of accelerations at the trunk were strongly correlated with RMS values at the foot in the sagittal plane (r = 0.883, p < 0.01) and in the frontal plane (r = 0.811, p < 0.01). ApEn values at the trunk were moderately correlated with ApEn values at the foot in the sagittal plane (r = 0.603, p < 0.01) only. These results show that acceleration variability at the foot is related to acceleration variability at the trunk, specifically that increased variability at the foot is tied to increased variability at the trunk in healthy adults. Portable inertial sensors can potentially be used in any environment including a laboratory, clinic, or at home to measure lower and upper body segment motion, and assessing relationships between upper and lower body motion may provide a more comprehensive evaluation of overall stability.

Additionally, smartwatches are experiencing greater social acceptability, even among the elderly. While step counting is an essential parameter to calculate the user's spatial activity, current detection algorithms are insufficient for calculating steps when using a rollator, which is a common walking aid for elderly people. Through a pilot study conducted with eight different wrist-worn smart devices, an overall recognition of similar to 10% was achieved. This is because characteristic motions utilized by step counting algorithms are poorly reflected at the user's wrist when pushing a rollator. This issue is also present among other spatial activities such as pushing a pram, a bike, and a shopping cart. This paper thus introduces an improved step counting algorithm for wrist-worn accelerometers. This new algorithm was first evaluated through a controlled study and achieved promising results with an overall recognition of similar to 85%. As a follow-up, a preliminary field study with randomly selected elderly people who used rollators resulted in similar detection rates of similar to 83%. To conclude, this research will expectantly contribute to greater step counting precision in smart wearable technology.",Proceedings Paper,10.1145/3267782.3267784,WOS:000493133300020,WoS,Yes,,,no,Conference proceeding,,Out of scope (topic),"no MS patients, interesting"

Vibrotactile biofeedback of trunk sway has been shown to improve balance control in patients with peripheral and central vestibular disorders. Here, the effects of vibrotactile feedback training on trunk sway and a possible carry-over effect was measured in MS patients during stance and gait. Methods Ten MS patients (mean age 46.8±7.7 years, 40% male) participated in a crossover study in which 7 different stance and gait tasks were trained with and without angle feedback for stance and angular velocity feedback for gait. An assessment sequence of 12 tasks was performed once before and twice after the training sequence. Trunk sway was measured with body-worn gyroscopes. Head mounted vibrotactile biofeedback of trunk sway was provided during one crossover training arm and the following second assessment sequence. Results Biofeedback generally leads to a decrease in sway but an increase in sway angular velocities during some stance tasks compared to training without biofeedback. Biofeedback while walking eyes open resulted in a decreased sway angular velocity. The greatest changes were found in the pitch direction of trunk sway. Effects diminished after biofeedback was removed. Conclusions This study showed that vibrotactile biofeedback of trunk sway beneficially effects stance and provides significant improvement in gait compared to training without biofeedback in MS patients.",Article,10.1016/J.MSARD.2016.05.003,http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=22110356&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.msard.2016.05.003&atitle=The+effect+of+vibrotactile+biofeedback+of+trunk+sway+on+balance+control+in+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Mult.+Scler.+Relat.+Disord.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis+and+Related+Disorders&volume=8&issue=&spage=58&epage=63&aulast=Van+Der+Logt&aufirst=R.P.&auinit=R.P.&aufull=Van+Der+Logt+R.P.&coden=&isbn=&pages=58-63&date=2016&auinit1=R&auinitm=P,Embase,Yes,,,no,Out of scope,,Out of scope (topic),"wearable for therapy, not diagnostic"

A Randomized Parallel Group Trial,Physiotherapy research international : the journal for researchers and clinicians in physical therapy,2016,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The most effective treatment approach to improve walking in people with multiple sclerosis (MS) is not known. The aim of this trial was to assess the efficacy of treadmill training and progressive strength training on walking in people with MS.METHODS: A single blinded randomized parallel group trial was carried out. Eligible participants were adults with MS with Expanded Disability Status Scale score ?6. A total of 29 participants were randomized and 28 received the allocated exercise intervention, treadmill (n?=?13) or strength training (n?=?15). Both groups exercised 30?minutes, three times a week for 8?weeks. Primary outcome was The Functional Ambulation Profile evaluated by the GAITRite walkway. Secondary outcomes were walking work economy and balance control during walking, measured by a small lightweight accelerometer connected to the lower back. Testing was performed at baseline and the subsequent week after completion of training.RESULTS: Two participants were lost to follow-up, and 11 (treadmill) and 15 (strength training) were left for analysis. The treadmill group increased their Functional Ambulation Profile score significantly compared with the strength training group (p?=?.037). A significant improvement in walking work economy (p?=?.024) and a reduction of root mean square of vertical acceleration (p?=?.047) also favoured the treadmill group.DISCUSSION: The results indicate that task-specific training by treadmill walking is a favourable approach compared with strength training to improve walking in persons with mild and moderate MS. Implications for Physiotherapy practice, this study adds knowledge for the decision of optimal treatment approaches in people with MS.

This study investigated PA levels in persons with MS as a function of fall risk categories. Forty-seven persons with MS participated in the study and were categorized into either increased fall risk (IFR; n = 21; 55.5 ± 9.0 years) or normal fall risk (NFR; n = 26; 51.2 ± 12.9 years) groups based on scores from the Activities-Balance Confidence scale. PA was measured by accelerometer and expressed as average steps per day, and time spent in sedentary behavior, light PA, and moderate to vigorous physical activity over the course of 7 consecutive days. Univariate and covariate analyses were used to compare the differences in PA between fall risk groups. The average steps per day of the NFR group was significant higher compared with the IFR group (6024 ± 2533.1 vs. 2599 ± 1622.7 steps; P < 0.001), and the difference remained after controlling for disability level (5351 ± 2298.6 vs. 3432 ± 2363.6 steps; P = 0.016). There were no differences in light PA and moderate to vigorous physical activity between groups after controlling for disability level.

Timed up and go (TUG) is a widely used measure of functional mobility and an instrumented TUG which make use of inertial sensors has been recently tested in MS (Pau et al., 2017). This approach allows obtaining time, acceleration and velocities of each TUG sub-phase (i.e. sit-tostand, intermediate and final turning, stand-to-sit). In addition, as it is based on open-task, TUG evaluate also programming, planning, navigation and other executive functions. Since clinical disabilities, especially motor and cognitive impairment, are highly related to brain atrophy (Charil, A., et al., 2006), and TUG is able to combine these abilities in a single task, the purpose of this study was to evaluate relationship between brain volumes and instrumented TUG (iTUG) performances. Methods: Inclusion criteria for enrollment were a diagnosis of MS according to McDonald criteria and been able to walk at least 20m. iTUG was performed using a wearable inertial sensor as previously reported by Pau et al.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate segmental control during quiet standing in PwMS and controls to understand whether MS alters use of the ankle and hip strategies to manage postural sway. Coherence of acceleration between the trunk and legs was evaluated with accelerometers placed on the sacrum and lower leg. Thirty-six PwMS and 20 healthy control subjects performed quiet standing with eyes open and closed while center of pressure (CoP) and acceleration of postural sway was measured. Acceleration frequencies were divided into lower frequencies (?1.0 Hz) and higher frequencies (>1.0 Hz) to categorize sway characteristics. With eyes open, coherence was significantly lower in PwMS compared to controls at lower frequencies only. With eyes closed, coherence was significantly lower in PwMS compared to controls, who use an ankle strategy at lower frequencies only, at both lower and higher frequencies. Both groups showed decreased coherence with increasing frequency when eyes were open and closed. Coherence was significantly correlated with CoP sway area in PwMS during the eyes closed condition only. The reduced coherence in PwMS during both lower and higher frequency sway indicates PwMS utilize a mixed ankle-hip sway strategy regardless of sway frequency.

METHODS: A total of eight functional tests were conducted and physical activity was objectively measured (Actigraph GT3X accelerometer) for one week in 34 people with multiple sclerosis. A corrected Akaike Information Criterion analysis was performed to identify the strongest correlates with moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, total activity and sedentary time. RESULTS: The multiple regression analysis converged on a model for moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (R2?=?0.31, F?=?6.97, p=?0.003) that included total strength of the less-affected leg (partial r?=?0.46, p?=?0.007) and average peg test performance (partial r?=?-0.30, p?=?0.087). The model for total activity (R2?=?0.40, F?=?10.51, p?<?0.001) included five times sit-to-stand performance (partial r=?-0.44, p?=?0.010) and total strength of the less-affected leg (partial r?=?0.31, p?=?0.077). The model for sedentary time (R2=0.22, F?=?9.23, p?=?0.005) only included total strength of the more affected leg (r=?-0.47, p?=?0.005). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that leg strength, manual dexterity and the ability to perform functional tasks may be important correlates with physical activity levels in people with multiple sclerosis. The findings of this pilot study can inform future investigations aiming to increase physical activity levels or develop improved rehabilitation protocols for people with multiple sclerosis. Implications for Rehabilitation Physical activity is an effective means of improving the symptoms associated with multiple sclerosis. Participation in physical activity by people with multiple sclerosis may be affected by functional factors such as leg strength, manual dexterity and the ability to rise from a seated position. Bilateral leg strength differences should be assessed and addressed in people with multiple sclerosis.",Article,10.1080/09638288.2017.1336647,http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14645165&id=doi:10.1080%2F09638288.2017.1336647&atitle=Functional+factors+that+are+important+correlates+to+physical+activity+in+people+with+multiple+sclerosis%3A+a+pilot+study&stitle=Disabil+Rehabil&title=Disability+and+rehabilitation&volume=40&issue=20&spage=2416&epage=2423&aulast=Ketelhut&aufirst=Nathaniel+B.&auinit=N.B.&aufull=Ketelhut+N.B.&coden=&isbn=&pages=2416-2423&date=2018&auinit1=N&auinitm=B,Embase,Yes,,,no,Out of scope,,included,accelerometer used as outcome measure

It is known that physical activity is closely related to fatigue, but the relationship between fatigue and physical activity level is not clear in patients with MS. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between fatigue and physical activity level in patients with MS. (Clinical trials number: NCT03255460) Methods: Fourteen ambulatory patients with MS (age: 35.5±9.8 years, EDSS: 1, 03±0, 6) participated in the study. Fatigue was assessed using Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS). Level of physical activity was evaluated with accelerometer (ActiGraph GT3X+) during three consecutive days and performed the amount of physical activity expressed in counts per minute (CPM), and counts per day period (morning, afternoon, evening), duration of physical activity intensity categories (sedentary, light, moderate, vigorous). Results: The FSS was found to be negatively associated with the light activity (r=-0.538, p<0.05) and the number of steps (r=-0.695, p<0.001). The physical effect section of FIS was associated with daily CPM (r=-0.610, p<0.05), morning CPM (r=-0.681, p<0.05), sedentary activity (r=0.631, p<0.05), light activity (r=-0.548, p<0.05), and number of steps (r=-0.854, p<0.001). The psychosocial effect section of FIS was associated with daily CPM (r=-0.535, p<0.05), morning CPM (r=-0.541, p<0.05), sedentary activity (r=0.550, p<0.05), and number of steps (r=-0.803, p<0.001). Conclusion: These results show that severity of fatigue increases in MS. Fatigue reduced both physical activity level and participation. We thought that a reduction in physical activity level could cause secondary problems due to inactivity. Therefore, management strategy of fatigue should be taught to patients to increase their physical activity level.",Conference Abstract,NA,http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13008757&id=doi:&atitle=Investigation+of+the+relationship+between+fatigue+and+physical+activity+level+in+patients+with+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Fiz.+Rehab.&title=Fizyoterapi+Rehabilitasyon&volume=29&issue=2&spage=S23&epage=S24&aulast=%C3%87ekim&aufirst=Kader&auinit=K.&aufull=%C3%87ekim+K.&coden=&isbn=&pages=S23-S24&date=2018&auinit1=K&auinitm=,Embase,Yes,,,no,Abstract,,Abstract only,

The study included 30 PwMS, mean disease duration 11.8 (SD = 6.8) years, and 15 healthy controls. The investigation included a cognitive assessment; texting assessment based on 100 typed characters; and gait assessment under two different conditions: normal walking and walking while texting. Outcome measures included the Symbol Digit Modalities Test to assess cognition. Texting measures included accuracy (%) and duration(s). Gait was assessed with axial accelerometers to quantify temporal measures. The dual-task cost percentage for the walking tests and texting accuracy was determined by calculating the percentage change from a single task to a double task. The impact of texting while walking on gait measures was significantly higher in PwMS; furthermore, texting was less accurate compared to the healthy controls. The dual-task cost for texting accuracy in the PwMS group was 153.3 (SD = 105.7) compared to 8.9 (SD = 26.6) in the healthy group. A significant association was found solely in the PwMS group between cognition and texting accuracy while in a sitting position (R(2) = 0.564) and while walking (R(2) = 0.534).

Although the sensation of fatigue, tiredness, and energy level adversely affect physical activity (PA), the association between fatigability and objectively measured PA is unknown. Methods: Participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (n = 557, 50% women, aged 50-97 years) were instructed to wear an Actiheart accelerometer for 7 consecutive days in the free-living environment. Perceived fatigability was assessed using the Borg rating of perceived exertion (RPE) after 5 minutes of treadmill walking at 1.5 mph (0.67 m/s) and categorized as low (6-7 RPE), intermediate (8-9 RPE), and high (10(+) RPE) fatigability. Time-of-day PA differences between fatigability groups were assessed using mixed-effects modeling. Results: Total daily PA was 1.3% lower for every unit increment in perceived fatigability after adjusting for demographic, behavioral, and medical factors (p = .01). In time-of-day analyses, the high fatigability group was less active compared to the low fatigability group throughout the day (8: 00 am to 8: 00 pm) and the intermediate fatigability group in the morning (8: 00 am to 12: 00 pm). Patterns of PA within the high fatigability group differed from both the intermediate and low groups in the morning but mirrored the intermediate group in the afternoon and evening. Discussion: These results suggest that RPE is a bio-marker of fatigability associated with progressively lower PA with aging. Whether the effects of fatigability occurring at the end of the day reflect waning energy levels or a voluntary choice that could be modified remains to be evaluated.",Article,10.1093/GERONA/GLX181,WOS:000430696300010,WoS,No,Out of scope (topic),,yes,,,Out of scope (topic),no MS patients

More sensitive and ecologically valid outcome measures are needed to advance MS research. Objectives: To assess continuous step count activity remotely among individuals with MS for 1 year and determine how average daily step count is associated with other measures of MS disability. Design, Setting, and Participants: In a prospective longitudinal observational cohort study, 95 adults with relapsing or progressive MS who were able to walk more than 2 minutes with or without an assistive device were recruited between June 15, 2015, and August 8, 2016, and remotely monitored in their natural environment for 1 year. Patients were excluded if they had a clinical relapse within 30 days or comorbidity contributing to ambulatory impairment. Longitudinal analysis was performed from October 2017 to March 2018. Revised analysis was performed in December 2018. Intervention: Activity monitoring of step count using a wrist-worn accelerometer. Main Outcomes and Measures: Average daily step count compared with in-clinic assessments and patient-reported outcomes. Results: Of the 95 participants recruited (59 women and 36 men; mean [SD] age, 49.6 [13.6] years [range, 22.0-74.0 years]), 35 (37%) had progressive MS, and the median baseline Expanded Disability Status Scale score was 4.0 (range, 0-6.5). At 1 year, 79 participants completed follow-up (83% retention). There was a modest reduction in accelerometer use during the 1 year of the study. A decreasing average daily step count during the study was associated with worsening of clinic-based outcomes (Timed 25-Foot Walk, ??=?-13.09; P?<?.001; Timed-Up-and-Go, ??=?-9.25; P?<?.001) and patient-reported outcomes (12-item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale, ??=?-17.96; P?<?.001). A decreasing average daily step count occurred even when the Expanded Disability Status Scale score remained stable, and 12 of 25 participants (48%) with a significant decrease in average daily step count during the study did not have a reduction on other standard clinic-based metrics. Participants with a baseline average daily step count below 4766 (cohort median) had higher odds of clinically meaningful disability (Expanded Disability Status Scale score) worsening at 1 year, adjusting for age, sex, and disease duration (odds ratio, 4.01; 95% CI, 1.17-13.78; P?=?.03). Conclusions and Relevance: Continuous remote activity monitoring of individuals with MS for 1 year appears to be feasible. In this study, a decreasing average daily step count during a 1-year period was associated with worsening of standard ambulatory measures but could also occur even when traditional disability measures remained stable. These results appear to support the prospect of using the average daily step count as a sensitive longitudinal outcome measure in MS and as a clinically relevant metric for targeted intervention.",Article,10.1001/JAMANETWORKOPEN.2019.0570,http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=25743805&id=doi:10.1001%2Fjamanetworkopen.2019.0570&atitle=Association+of+Continuous+Assessment+of+Step+Count+by+Remote+Monitoring+With+Disability+Progression+Among+Adults+With+Multiple+Sclerosis&stitle=JAMA+Netw+Open&title=JAMA+network+open&volume=2&issue=3&spage=e190570&epage=&aulast=Block&aufirst=Valerie+J.&auinit=V.J.&aufull=Block+V.J.&coden=&isbn=&pages=e190570-&date=2019&auinit1=V&auinitm=J,Embase,Yes,,,no,Out of scope,,included,

While their problems are known, only limited evidence is available about intervention tools that could help them curb those problems. OBJECTIVE: This study was aimed at upgrading and assessing a smartphone-based technology package, which was recently developed to help those individuals to independently engage in basic communication and leisure. METHODS: The study included 11 non-ambulatory participants who had no speech or functional active communication. They were provided with (a) a Samsung A3 smartphone with Android 6.0 Operating System, which was fitted with WhatsApp Messenger and programmed via MacroDroid, and (b) cards fitted with radio frequency identification (RFID) tags. By bringing those cards in contact with the back of the smartphone, the participant could start a communication event (e.g., sending a message to a friend) or activate a leisure event (e.g., a song). The smartphone would automatically read to the participant any incoming messages. RESULTS: During the baseline (i.e., when a standard smartphone was available), the participants were unable to engage in communication or leisure.

Some falls result in injuries and the cost associated with their treatment is high. This is a complex problem that requires several steps in order to be tackled. Firstly, it is crucial to develop strategies that recognize the locomotion mode, indicating the state of the subject in various situations. This article aims to develop a strategy capable of identifying normal gait, the pre-fall condition, and the fall situation, based on a wearable system (IMUs-based). This system was used to collect data from healthy subjects that mimicked falls. The strategy consists, essentially, in the construction and use of classifiers as tools for recognizing the locomotion modes. Two approaches were explored. Associative Skill Memories (ASMs) based classifier and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier based on deep learning. Finally, these classifiers were compared, providing for a tool with a good accuracy in recognizing the locomotion modes. Results have shown that the accuracy of the classifiers was quite acceptable.

Purpose: This study involved a secondary analysis of data focused on SCT constructs as correlates of individual-level changes (i.e., response heterogeneity)following a behavioral intervention. Method: Twenty-two persons with MS who completed a 6-month SCT-based behavioral intervention for increasing physical activity were included in analyses. The intervention consisted of two primary components, namely a dedicated Internet website and one-on-one video chats with a behavioral coach. Outcomes included objectively-measured moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA)using Actigraph model GT3X+ accelerometers and self-reported physical activity using the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ)as well as SCT variables of exercise self-efficacy, barriers self-efficacy, outcome expectations, goal setting and planning and facilitators/impediments. Results: There was individual variability in physical activity change following the intervention. For example, 4/22 participants demonstrated a reduction in MVPA, 1/22 participants had no change, 9/22 participants had less than 0.5 standard deviation (SD)increase in MVPA, and 8/22 participants had an increase in MVPA of more than 0.5 SD. Baseline SCT variables, particularly outcome expectations, goal setting, planning, and barriers self-efficacy, correlated with increased physical activity.

Methods This two-phase study recruited online research network members reporting MS and who were utilizing Fitbit One (TM) activity trackers. In the first phase, participant interviews assessed demand based on physical activity and the use of behavior-change techniques. The second phase assessed the demand, limited efficacy, acceptability, and practicality of a Wearables 101 course that integrated behavior change and self-experimentation principles. Tracker data were used to determine the percent of matches between daily symptom-based step goals and step counts. Results Participants expressed demand in the form of interest in gaining insights about a possible sweet spot behavioral target, if a system could be produced to support that. Limited efficacy results were mixed, with approximately one-third of participants dropping out and only half matching their daily target goals for at least 50% of days. In terms of practicality, participants commented on the burden of daily measurement and the need for a longer baseline period. Participants noted that tracking helped support an understanding of the link between activities and symptom severity, suggesting acceptability. Conclusions Results suggested that the intervention demand and acceptability criteria were demonstrated more strongly than limited efficacy and practicality. The matching intervention tested in this study will require refinement in baseline measurement, goal definition, and reduced data-gathering burden. Such changes may improve efficacy and practicality requirements and, by extension, later impact of the intervention on MS outcomes.

However, instrumental assessment is needed to provide quantitative measures. Objective: To develop and validate an instrumented version of the mDGI. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Clinical setting. Participants: Thirty adults with neurologic disorders (10 with multiple sclerosis, 10 with Parkinson disease, and 10 with stroke) and 20 healthy volunteers. Methods: Participants were assessed with the Timed Up and Go test (TUG) and with the mDGI. During the assessment of mDGI, data were collected by a single Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) positioned on the sternum. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the instrumented data extracting eight PC scores (ImPC) describing dynamic balance. The instrumented overall score (ImDGI) was then calculated as the sum of the mPCs. PCA revealed two components associated with stride features and regularity (ImDGI_Gait_Pattern) and trunk movements (ImDGI_Trunk_Sway). Spearman coefficients were calculated between mDGI and ImDGI, whereas Mann-Whitney (U) and Kruskal-Wallis (H) tests assessed differences between groups and neurologic conditions. Main Outcome Measurements: ImDGI. Results: ImDGI did not show ceiling effects, and good correlations were found between ImDGI and mDGI (r =.84), and TUG (r =.84) for people with neurologic disorders (P <.001). Significant differences among pathologies (H test((2))=12.5, P =.002) and between healthy participants and adults with neurologic disorders (U test = 47.0, P =.001) were found.

There are a wide range of symptoms, with fatigue reported as one of the most troublesome. MS Energizeor MS Energise in UK English regionsis an iPhone app focused on self-management of fatigue for people with MS. Based on cognitive-behavioral therapy principles, the app covers MS fatigue, how to use energy effectively, how behavior, thoughts and emotions interact and impact on MS fatigue, as well as the potential effects of bodily and environmental factors. MS Energize provides education, interactive tasks, and supports application of the principles into a user's day-to-day life. We field tested the usability and perceived usefulness of MS Energize with 11 people with longstanding multiple sclerosis in New Zealand and the United Kingdom. Participants used the app over a period of five to six weeks after which they rated the usability of the app and participated in an in-depth qualitative interview. We developed four main themes through our thematic analysis. 1. Validation of participants' own experiences of living with MS fatigue. 2. The personal cost in engaging with such an intervention. 3. Reframing experiences and adding to knowledge. 4. That the app was generally a good idea. Field testers' feedback also identified usability issues that could be addressed. In particular, the amount of text-based content in the app contributed to the app itself being fatiguing. This field-testing process has highlighted the value of the app while also guiding our roadmap for further developments to enhance usability and usefulness. The next step is further refinement of components of MS Energize in preparation for a trial of its clinical and cost effectiveness.",Article,10.1016/J.INVENT.2019.100291,http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=22147829&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.invent.2019.100291&atitle=MS+Energize%3A+Field+trial+of+an+app+for+self-management+of+fatigue+for+people+with+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Internet+Interv.&title=Internet+Interventions&volume=18&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Babbage&aufirst=Duncan+R.&auinit=D.R.&aufull=Babbage+D.R.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2019&auinit1=D&auinitm=R,Embase,No,Out of scope (topic),,yes,,,Out of scope (topic),

The objective of this study was to compare the physical activity of those with chronic diseases to healthy individuals using an objective measure of physical activity. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of data from 96 706 participants aged 40 years or older from the UK Biobank prospective cohort study (2006-10). Diagnoses were identified through ICD 9 and 10 coding within hospital admission records and a cancer registry linked to UK Biobank participants.

Statistical analyses included computation of adjusted geometric means and means using general linear models. Results: Participants with chronic disease undertook 9% or 61 minutes (95% confidence interval: 57.8-64.8) less moderate activity and 11% or 3 minutes (95% confidence interval: 2.7-3.3) less vigorous activity per week than individuals without chronic disease.

Here, we studied multiple sclerosis (MS) as a model neurological disease for investigating physiometric and environmental signals. The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility and correlation of wearable biosensors with traditional clinical measures of disability both in clinic and in free-living in MS patients. This is a single site observational cohort study conducted at an academic neurological center specializing in MS. A cohort of 25 MS patients with varying disability scores were recruited. Patients were monitored in clinic while wearing biosensors at nine body locations at three separate visits. Biosensor-derived features including aspects of gait (stance time, turn angle, mean turn velocity) and balance were collected, along with standardized disability scores assessed by a neurologist. Participants also wore up to three sensors on the wrist, ankle, and sternum for 8 weeks as they went about their daily lives. The primary outcomes were feasibility, adherence, as well as correlation of biosensor-derived metrics with traditional neurologist-assessed clinical measures of disability. We used machine-learning algorithms to extract multiple features of motion and dexterity and correlated these measures with more traditional measures of neurological disability, including the expanded disability status scale (EDSS) and the MS functional composite-4 (MSFC-4). In free-living, sleep measures were additionally collected. Twenty-three subjects completed the first two of three in-clinic study visits and the 8-week free-living biosensor period. Several biosensor-derived features significantly correlated with EDSS and MSFC-4 scores derived at visit two, including mobility stance time with MSFC-4 z-score (Spearman correlation ?0.546; p = 0.0070), several aspects of turning including turn angle (0.437; p = 0.0372), and maximum angular velocity (0.653; p = 0.0007). Similar correlations were observed at subsequent clinic visits, and in the free-living setting. We also found other passively collected signals, including measures of sleep, that correlated with disease severity.

Objective: Hypothesis: This preliminary, cross-sectional study examined social-cognitive theory(SCT) variables as correlates of sedentary behavior in MS. We hypothesized that scores from SCT variables for sedentary behavior change would correlate with scores from self-reported and device-measured volumes of sedentary behavior in MS. We further hypothesized that the correlations would be stronger for self-reported than device-measured sedentary behavior, and that the primary correlate of sedentary behavior would be self-efficacy. Methods: We recruited participants through a random sample of 1,000 persons enrolled in the North American Research Committee on MS registry, and 275 of the 296 persons who underwent screening volunteered for the study. Participants wore an ActiGraph accelerometer on a belt around the waist for measuring minutes per day of sedentary behavior. Participants further completed a newly-created, study-specific measure of SCT variables for reducing sedentary behavior(i.e., self-efficacy, outcome expectations, barriers, goal setting, & planning) and the abbreviated International Physical Activity Questionnaire as a self-report measure of sitting time. Results: Self-reported sedentary behavior was associated with self-efficacy(r = ?0.47), goal setting(r = ?0.31), planning(r = ?0.35), and barriers(r = 0.39) for reducing sedentary behavior. Device-measured sedentary behavior was associated with self-efficacy(r = ?0.32), goal setting(r = ?0.21), planning(r = ?0.18), and barriers(r = 0.20). Self-efficacy(? = ?0.29), barriers(? = 0.26), and planning(? = ?0.24) independently explained variance in self-reported sedentary behavior(R(2) = 0.33).

This approach is motivated by the goal of diagnosing gait abnormalities on a symptom-by-symptom basis, irrespective of other neuromuscular movement disorders the patients may be affected by. This could lead to improvements in treatment and offer a greater insight into movement disorders. Methods: In-shoe pressure was measured for 12 able-bodied participants, each subject to eight artificially induced gait alterations, achieved by modifying the underside of the shoe. The data were recorded at 100 Hz over 2520 data channels and were analyzed using the deep learning architecture and the long term short term memory networks. Additionally, the rationale for the decision-making process of these networks was investigated. Conclusion: Long term short term memory networks are applicable to the classification of the gait function. The classifications can be made using only 2 s of sparse data (82.0% accuracy over 96 000 instances of test data) from participants who were not a part of the training set. Significance: This paper provides potential for the gait function to be accurately classified using non-invasive techniques, and at more regular intervals, outside of a clinical setting, without the need for healthcare professionals to be present.",Article,10.1109/TBME.2019.2900863,WOS:000502102200015,WoS,No,Out of scope (topic),,yes,,,Out of scope (topic),"no MS patients, interesting (pressure in-shoe in HC only)"

Changes in PB are often assumed as a consequence of fatigue, but effects of interventions that aim to reduce fatigue by improving PB are not sufficient. Since the heterogeneous nature of MS related symptoms, levels of PB of fatigued patients at the start of interventions might vary substantially. Better understanding of the variability by identification of PB subtypes in fatigued patients may help to develop more effective personalized rehabilitation programs in the future. This study aimed to identify PB subtypes in fatigued patients with multiple sclerosis based on multidimensional PB outcome measures. Methods: Baseline accelerometer (Actigraph) data, demographics and clinical characteristics of the TREFAMS-ACE participants (n = 212) were used for secondary analysis. All patients were ambulatory and diagnosed with severe fatigue based on a score of ?35 on the fatigue subscale of the Checklist Individual Strength (CIS20r). Fifteen PB measures were used derived from 7 day measurements with an accelerometer. Principal component analysis was performed to define key outcome measures for PB and two-step cluster analysis was used to identify PB types. Results: Analysis revealed five key outcome measures: percentage sedentary behavior, total time in prolonged moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, number of sedentary bouts, and two types of change scores between day parts (morning, afternoon and evening). Based on these outcomes three valid PB clusters were derived. Conclusions: Patients with severe MS-related fatigue show three distinct and homogeneous PB subtypes. These PB subtypes, based on a unique set of PB outcome measures, may offer an opportunity to design more individually-tailored interventions in rehabilitation.

Method: Persons with MS were recruited through the distribution of printed letters to a random sample of 1,000 persons from the North American Research Committee on MS registry. Two hundred ninety-five persons with MS were interested and volunteered to wear an ActiGraph accelerometer for a 7-day period and complete a battery of questionnaires that included the IPAQ-SF and Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire over this period of time. Results: IPAQ-SF sitting time scores were consistently and moderately correlated with all of the sedentary behavior metrics from the accelerometer (range of r between .295 and .431), and the correlations were stronger than those between self-reported physical activity and sedentary metrics from the accelerometer (range of r between -.087 and .163). The correlations between IPAQ-SF sitting time scores with the accelerometer-derived sedentary behavior metrics were still statistically significant in the analyses controlling for physical activity (range of parametric correlations between .281 and .411).

Participants (n = 63 [15M and 48F], age: 56.6 ± 7.3 years) wore an accelerometer on the hip for a 7-day period and completed the MSQ. Sedentary behaviour (SB) estimates were computed as min/day for both the MSQ and accelerometer. Associations between the two methods were examined using the Pearson correlation and agreement was assessed using a Bland-Altman plot. A linear prediction model was developed to improve the accuracy of the MSQ estimates using a selection of predictor variables routinely collected in MS research. There was a moderate correlation between MSQ and accelerometer SB estimates (r = 0.34, p < 0.01). The Bland-Altman plot indicated that the MSQ overestimated SB (mean bias: 80.54 min/day, 95% limits of agreement: -410.5 to 571.5 min/day). The prediction model improved the MSQ estimates by 39% and virtually eliminated measurement bias (mean bias:-0.21 min/day; 95% limits of agreement:-109.8 to 109.4 min/day).

Impaired ambulation results in loss of independence. Current approaches to document disease impact/progression on ambulation including EDSS/T25FW are insufficiently sensitive to quantify subtle but critical change. Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) for gait relate to several critical elements of the gait cycle beyond velocity. Earlier recognition of critical change might improve disease modifying therapy choice and timing of change. Objective multi-dimensional analytics have included digital devices of varying types utilizing different technologies (e.g. foot pressure, accelerometer, 3D video capture). Comparing different technologies in people with MS (PwMS) along a spectrum of disability would be important to optimal technology choice. Simultaneous comparisons of similar outcome measures of gait components would enhance technology choice. Objectives: To compare and contrast quantified outcome measures of the gait cycle as measured by the use of three different validated and digital ambulatory devices. Methods: PwMS performed one pass (20 feet) while ambulating at a preferred walking speed along the Zeno walkway (ZW, ProtoKinetics), while wearing Opal sensors (OS, APDM), and captured using VSTBalance (VB, VirtuSense) simultaneously. Relevant gait parameters (GP) captured: velocity, stride length, total double support, and cadence. Univariate regression modeling and T-tests were used for statistical analysis for each GP. Results: 9 PwMS (69% female, average age =53.1±11.8 years). Regression modeling showed the following relationships: velocity: ZWvsVB (r2 =0.93, p=1.2E-25), ZWvsOS (r2 =0.99, p=6.9E-40), VBvsOS (r2 =0.96, p=1.8E-25) Stride Length: ZWvsVB (r2 =0.32, p=7.8E-25), ZWvsOS (r2 =0.9, p=1.02E-16), VBvsOS (r2 =0.30, p=1.3E-4). Total double support %: ZWvsVB (r2 =0.22, p=1.6E-3), ZWvsOS (r2 =0.87, p=3.2E-20), VBvsOS (r2 =0.27, p=3.9E-4). Cadence: ZWvsVB (r2 =0.18, p=5.3E-3), ZWvsOS (r2 =0.92, p=1.2E-23), VBvsOS (r2 =0.19, p=4.2E-3). T-tests showed the following relationships: velocity: ZWvsVB (p=0.47), ZWvsOS (p=0.21), VBvsOS (p=0.63). Stride Length: ZWvsVB (p=7.25E-6), ZWvsOS (p=0.08), VBvsOS (p=0.001).

Conclusions: Gait velocity had the strongest concordant relationship between all three technologies. Despite this concordance, there was still ~10% variability of this important measure. Other elements of the gait cycle had sub-optimal cross-device relationships. There was considerable discordance with stride length and cadence (ZWvsVB and OSvsVB), and double support (ZWvsOS and VBvsOS).

Identifying potential fallers and giving them proper attention could reduce their chance of a fall that results in severe injuries and decreased quality of life. In this study, we introduced a novel approach for fall risk prediction that evaluates Short-form Berg Balance Scale scores via inertial measurement unit data measured from a 3-meter timed-up-and-go test. This approach used sensor technology and was thus easy to implement, and allowed a quantitative analysis of both gait and balance. The results showed that elastic net logistic regression achieved the best performance with 85% accuracy and 88% area under the curve compared with support vector machine, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and stepwise logistic regression. This paper provides a framework for using sensor-based features together with a feature-selection strategy for screening and predicting the fall risk of post-stroke patients in a convenient setup with high accuracy. The findings of this study will not only enable the assessment of fall risk among post-stroke patients in a cost-effective manner but also provide decision-making support for community care providers and medical professionals in the form of sensor-based data on gait performance.",Article,10.1109/JSEN.2020.2987623,WOS:000550685000050,WoS,No,Out of scope (topic),,yes,,,Out of scope (topic),"no MS patients, interesting (stroke)"

However, one overarching limitation of this research is that researchers have not recruited samples who have the actual problem of being studied (i.e., cognitive processing speed impairment). This study examined associations between device-measured PA and cognitive processing speed in a large sample of persons with MS overall and between those with and without cognitive processing speed impairment. METHOD: Three hundred eighty-five persons with MS underwent the oral Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) and wore an accelerometer for 7 days for PA measurement. We divided the overall sample into subsamples with (n = 140) and without (n = 245) cognitive processing speed impairment based on age, sex, and education-adjusted SDMT Z-scores. RESULTS: After controlling for age and disability status, higher levels of device-measured PA were significantly associated with faster cognitive processing speed overall, and the association was significantly stronger among persons with MS who presented with cognitive processing speed impairment. CONCLUSIONS: This examination provides initial cross-sectional support for informing the development of PA interventions as a possible approach for managing MS-related cognitive processing speed impairment. This highlights the importance of developing purposefully designed trials involving PA interventions for targeting cognitive processing speed as a primary end point among persons with MS with impaired cognitive processing speed.",Article,10.1017/S1355617720000284,http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14697661&id=doi:10.1017%2FS1355617720000284&atitle=Device-Measured+Physical+Activity+and+Cognitive+Processing+Speed+Impairment+in+a+Large+Sample+of+Persons+with+Multiple+Sclerosis&stitle=J+Int+Neuropsychol+Soc&title=Journal+of+the+International+Neuropsychological+Society+%3A+JINS&volume=26&issue=8&spage=798&epage=805&aulast=Sandroff&aufirst=Brian+M.&auinit=B.M.&aufull=Sandroff+B.M.&coden=&isbn=&pages=798-805&date=2020&auinit1=B&auinitm=M,Embase,No,Out of scope (topic),,yes,,,included,accelerometer used as outcome measure

Enhancing physical activity (PA) might promote neuroregeneration in multiple sclerosis (MS) and positively influence disability, thus providing an alternative to medical treatment. Previous studies indicate that evidence-based patient information (EBPI) is essential for inducing behavioral change, e.g. enhancing PA. Objective: To investigate feasibility of a smartphone app providing EBPI about the benefit of PA and a simple activity feedback to enhance PA in people with CPMS in a pilot randomized controlled trial over 3 months. Methods: Thirty-eight people with CPMS (mean age 51 years, median Expanded Disability Status Scale 4.0) were 1:1 randomized into either a control group (n = 20) or an intervention group (n = 18). The intervention group received access to a multimedia EBPI app including activity feedback, texts, figures and videos. In the control group, participants received a leaflet with unspecific information about exercising in general. The EPBI itself was designed based on a systematic review. At baseline and after 3 months, all participants underwent clinical performance tests, filled in questionnaires and received an activity monitor (Actigraph(Ò)) for 7 days. The primary endpoint was the rate of responders defined as participants with a 20% increase of physical acitivity (time of moderate or vigiorous PAMVPA) or 20% increase of the number of steps, both assessed with the activity monitor. As secondary endpoints, we compared accelerometry, performance and questionnaires adjusted for baseline measurments between the groups (ANCOVA). Moreover, we used questionnaires to compare knowledge about exercise (activity requiring physical effort, carried out to improve or improve health and fitness) in MS, usability of the app in general and motivation towards a more active lifestyle after 3 months in both groups. Results: The groups showed significant differences in disease duration and PA according to the GodinLeisure Time Exercise Questionnaire at baseline. After 3 months, we detected no difference in the rate of responders, which was an overall 22%. However, MVPA significantly increased in both groups (p < 0.001) and the intervention group tended to have a higher motivation towards a more active lifestyle (Cohens D = 0.7, p = 0.09) as measured by the questionnaire. Reponses also showed, that participants appreciated the app but claimed a lack of interactivity as a shortcoming. Conclusion: Just providing information in a multimedia smartphone app did not enhance physical activitiy more than a simple leaflet in this small pilot trial in CPMS. However, the group of app users tended to have a higher motivation towards a more active lifestyle. Overall, the concept of a smartphone app to support an active lifestyle in MS is highly appreciated by participants.",Article,10.7717/PEERJ.9303,http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=21678359&id=doi:10.7717%2Fpeerj.9303&atitle=Feasibility+of+a+smartphone+app+to+enhance+physical+activity+in+progressive+MS%3A+A+pilot+randomized+controlled+pilot+trial+over+three+months&stitle=PeerJ&title=PeerJ&volume=2020&issue=6&spage=&epage=&aulast=Nasseri&aufirst=Navina+N.&auinit=N.N.&aufull=Nasseri+N.N.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2020&auinit1=N&auinitm=N,Embase,No,Out of scope (topic),,yes,,,included,"accelerometer used as outcome measure, Actigraph"

However, differences in methods of determining stability such as sensor type and placements, may lead to different results and affect their interpretation when comparing to controls and other studies. Questions: Do people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) exhibit lower gait stability? Do location and type of data used to calculate stability metrics affect comparisons? Methods: 30 PwMS with no walking impairments as clinically measured and 15 healthy controls walked on a treadmill at 1.2 ms(?1) while 3D acceleration data was obtained from sacrum, shoulder and cervical markers and from an accelerometer placed at the sacrum. The local divergence exponent was calculated for the four data sources. An ANOVA with group (multiple sclerosis and control) and data source as main factors was used to determine the effect of disease, data source and their interaction on stability metrics. Results: PwMS walked with significantly less stability according to all sensors (no interaction). A significant effect of data source on stability was also found, indicating that the local divergence exponent derived from sacrum accelerometer was lower than that derived from the other 3 sensor locations. Significance: PwMS with no evident gait impairments are less stable than healthy controls when walking on a treadmill. Although different data sources can be used to determine MS-related stability deterioration, a consensus about location and data source is needed. The local divergence exponent can be a useful measure of progression of gait instability at early stages of MS.",Article,10.1016/J.GAITPOST.2020.02.006,http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=18792219&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.gaitpost.2020.02.006&atitle=Gait+stability+at+early+stages+of+multiple+sclerosis+using+different+data+sources&stitle=Gait+Posture&title=Gait+and+Posture&volume=77&issue=&spage=214&epage=217&aulast=Cofr%C3%A9+Lizama&aufirst=L.+Eduardo&auinit=L.E.&aufull=Cofr%C3%A9+Lizama+L.E.&coden=GAPOF&isbn=&pages=214-217&date=2020&auinit1=L&auinitm=E,Embase,Yes,,,no,Out of scope,,included,

Many health care programs that use RMT rely on commercially available, """"off-the-shelf"""" devices to collect patient data. However, validation of these devices is sparse, the technology landscape is constantly changing, relative benefits between device options are often unclear, and research on patient and health care provider preferences is often lacking. Objective: To address these common challenges, we propose a novel device selection framework extrapolated from human-centered design principles, which are commonly used in de novo digital health product design. We then present a case study in which we used the framework to identify, test, select, and implement off-the-shelf devices for the Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse-Central Nervous System (RADAR-CNS) consortium, a research program using RMT to study central nervous system disease progression. Methods: The RADAR-CNS device selection framework describes a human-centered approach to device selection for mobile health programs. The framework guides study designers through stakeholder engagement, technology landscaping, rapid proof of concept testing, and creative problem solving to develop device selection criteria and a robust implementation strategy. It also describes a method for considering compromises when tensions between stakeholder needs occur. Results: The framework successfully guided device selection for the RADAR-CNS study on relapse in multiple sclerosis. In the initial stage, we engaged a multidisciplinary team of patients, health care professionals, researchers, and technologists to identify our primary device-related goals. We desired regular home-based measurements of gait, balance, fatigue, heart rate, and sleep over the course of the study. However, devices and measurement methods had to be user friendly, secure, and able to produce high quality data. In the second stage, we iteratively refined our strategy and selected devices based on technological and regulatory constraints, user feedback, and research goals. At several points, we used this method to devise compromises that addressed conflicting stakeholder needs. We then implemented a feedback mechanism into the study to gather lessons about devices to improve future versions of the RADAR-CNS program. Conclusions: The RADAR device selection framework provides a structured yet flexible approach to device selection for health care programs and can be used to systematically approach complex decisions that require teams to consider patient experiences alongside scientific priorities and logistical, technical, or regulatory constraints.",Article,10.2196/16043,http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=22915222&id=doi:10.2196%2F16043&atitle=Human-centered+design+strategies+for+device+selection+in+mhealth+programs%3A+Development+of+a+novel+framework+and+case+study&stitle=JMIR+mHealth+uHealth&title=JMIR+mHealth+and+uHealth&volume=8&issue=5&spage=&epage=&aulast=Polhemus&aufirst=Ashley+Marie&auinit=A.M.&aufull=Polhemus+A.M.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2020&auinit1=A&auinitm=M,Embase,Yes,,,no,Out of scope,,Out of scope (topic),interesting

Inertial measurement units (IMUs) provide reliable and yet easy quantitative gait assessment in routine clinical settings. However, to the best of our knowledge, no automated step-detection algorithm performs well in detecting severely altered pMS gait. Method: This article elaborates on a step-detection method based on personalized templates tested against a gold standard. Twenty-two individuals with pMS and 10 young healthy subjects (HSs) were instructed to walk on an electronic walkway wearing synchronized IMUs. Templates were derived from the IMU signals by using Initial and Final Contact times given by the walkway. These were used to detect steps from other gait trials of the same individual (intra-individual template-based detection, IITD) or another participant from the same group (pMS or HS) (intra-group template-based detection, IGTD). All participants were seen twice with a 6-month interval, with two measurements performed at each visit. Performance and accuracy metrics were computed, along with a similarity index (SId), which was computed as the mean distance between detected steps and their respective closest template. Results: For HS participants, both the IITD and the IGTD algorithms had precision and recall of 1.00 for detecting steps. For pMS participants, precision and recall ranged from 0.94 to 1.00 for IITD and 0.85 to 0.95 for IGTD depending on the level of disability. The SId was correlated with performance and the accuracy of the result. An SId threshold of 0.957 (IITD) and 0.963 (IGTD) could rule out decreased performance (F-measure ? 0.95), with negative predictive values of 0.99 and 0.96 with the IITD and IGTD algorithms. Also, the SId computed with the IITD and IGTD algorithms could distinguish individuals showing changes at 6-month follow-up. Conclusion: This personalized step-detection method has high performance for detecting steps in pMS individuals with severely altered gait. The algorithm can be self-evaluating with the SI, which gives a measure of the confidence the clinician can have in the detection. What is more, the SId can be used as a biomarker of change in disease severity occurring between the two measurement times.",Article,10.3389/FNEUR.2020.00261,http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=16642295&id=doi:10.3389%2Ffneur.2020.00261&atitle=Personalized+Template-Based+Step+Detection+From+Inertial+Measurement+Units+Signals+in+Multiple+Sclerosis&stitle=Front.+Neurol.&title=Frontiers+in+Neurology&volume=11&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Vienne-Jumeau&aufirst=Ali%C3%A9nor&auinit=A.&aufull=Vienne-Jumeau+A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2020&auinit1=A&auinitm=,Embase,Yes,,,no,Out of scope,,included,

MS results in declines in physical activity and peak oxygen consumption that might be independently associated with declines in walking performance. Therefore our purpose was to evaluate the association between physical activity and peak oxygen consumption with walking performance in individuals with MS. Methods: Fifty individuals with MS between the ages of 1870 yrs. (Female: 38; 46 ± 12 yrs.; BMI: 28.5 ± 6.4; EDSS: 3.3 [IQR: 2.54]) performed a maximal incremental cycle test to assess peak oxygen consumption (VO(2peak)), and wore an accelerometer for one week to measure moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Subjects further completed a timed 25-foot walk test (T25FW) and 6-minute walk (6MW) to measure walking performance. Results: MVPA and VO(2)peak were correlated with 6MW and T25FW (p < 0.05). When combined in multivariate regression analyses, VO(2peak) and MVPA were both significant contributors of T25FW speed and 6MW, but after controlling for sex and age, MVPA was the only significant contributor (? = 0.32 and ? = 0.44, respectively). Conclusion: Both higher MVPA and VO(2peak) were associated with better walking performance and in a combined model physical activity, but not peak oxygen consumption, remained an independent contributor to walking performance in individuals with MS.

The Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) is widely used to formally quantify CPS. We implemented a variant of the SDMT in MS sherpa, a smartphone app for persons with MS. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the construct validity and test-retest reliability of the MS sherpa smartphone variant of the SDMT (sSDMT). METHODS: We performed a validation study with 25 persons with relapsing-remitting MS and 79 healthy control (HC) subjects. In the HC group, 21 subjects were matched to the persons with MS with regard to age, gender, and education and they followed the same assessment schedule as the persons with MS (the """"HC matched"""" group) and 58 subjects had a less intense assessment schedule to determine reference values (the """"HC normative"""" group). Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were determined between the paper-and-pencil SDMT and its smartphone variant (sSDMT) on 2 occasions, 4 weeks apart. Other ICCs were determined for test-retest reliability, which were derived from 10 smartphone tests per study participant, with 3 days in between each test. Seven study participants with MS were interviewed regarding their experiences with the sSDMT. RESULTS: The SDMT scores were on average 12.06% higher than the sSDMT scores, with a standard deviation of 10.68%. An ICC of 0.838 was found for the construct validity of the sSDMT in the combined analysis of persons with MS and HC subjects. Average ICCs for test-retest reliability of the sSDMT for persons with MS, the HC matched group, and the HC normative group were 0.874, 0.857, and 0.867, respectively. The practice effect was significant between the first and the second test of the persons with MS and the HC matched group and trivial for all other test-retests. The interviewed study participants expressed a positive attitude toward the sSDMT, but they also discussed the importance of adapting a smartphone cognition test in accordance with the needs of the individual persons with MS. CONCLUSIONS: The high correlation between sSDMT and the conventional SDMT scores indicates a very good construct validity. Similarly, high correlations underpin a very good test-retest reliability of the sSDMT. We conclude that the sSDMT has the potential to be used as a tool to monitor CPS in persons with MS, both in clinical studies and in clinical practice.",Article,10.2196/18160,http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=22915222&id=doi:10.2196%2F18160&atitle=Symbol+Digit+Modalities+Test+Variant+in+a+Smartphone+App+for+Persons+With+Multiple+Sclerosis%3A+Validation+Study&stitle=JMIR+Mhealth+Uhealth&title=JMIR+mHealth+and+uHealth&volume=8&issue=10&spage=e18160&epage=&aulast=van+Oirschot&aufirst=Pim&auinit=P.&aufull=van+Oirschot+P.&coden=&isbn=&pages=e18160-&date=2020&auinit1=P&auinitm=,Embase,No,Out of scope (topic),Interesting for DREAMS team,yes,,,Out of scope (topic),SDMT only

Technological advances in biomechanics offer objective assessments of gait disabilities in clinical settings. Here we employed wearable sensors to measure electromyography (EMG) and body acceleration during walking and to quantify the altered gait pattern between people with progressive MS (PwPMS) and healthy controls (HCs). Forty consecutive patients attending our department as in-patients were examined together with fifteen healthy controls. All subjects performed the timed 10 min walking test (T10MW) using a wearable accelerator and 8 electrodes attached to bilateral thighs and legs so that body acceleration and EMG activity were recorded. The T10MWs were recorded under three conditions: standard (wearing shoes), reduced grip (wearing socks) and increased cognitive load (backward-counting dual-task). PwPMS showed worse kinematics of gait and increased muscle coactivation than controls at both the thigh and leg levels. Both reduced grip and increased cognitive load caused a reduction in the cadence and velocity of the T10MW, which were correlated with one another. A higher coactivation index at the thigh level of the more affected side was positively correlated with the time of the T10MW (r = 0.5, p < 0.01), Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) (r = 0.4, p < 0.05), and negatively correlated with the cadence (r = -0.6, p < 0.001). Our results suggest that excessive coactivation at the thigh level is the major determinant of the gait performance as the disease progresses. Moreover, demanding walking conditions do not influence gait in controls but deteriorate walking performances in PwPMS, thus those conditions should be prevented during hospital examinations as well as in homecare environments.",Article,10.3390/S20216160,http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14248220&id=doi:10.3390%2Fs20216160&atitle=The+Danger+of+Walking+with+Socks%3A+Evidence+from+Kinematic+Analysis+in+People+with+Progressive+Multiple+Sclerosis&stitle=Sensors+%28Basel%29&title=Sensors+%28Basel%2C+Switzerland%29&volume=20&issue=21&spage=&epage=&aulast=Huang&aufirst=Su-Chun&auinit=S.-C.&aufull=Huang+S.-C.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2020&auinit1=S&auinitm=-C,Embase,No,Out of scope (topic),,yes,,,included,ACC + EMG

The efficacy of SVT has never been examined in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS), therefore, our aim was to examine the immediate effect of SVT on cognitive function, gait and static balance performance in PwMS. This assessor-blinded, randomized crossover study included 26 PwMS, 16 females, mean age 47.9 and median EDSS score 4.5. Participants attended two sessions: SVT and control training. Exercises for both the SVT and control sessions were based on ball-catching tasks. Training sessions were identical in length (4050 min) and type of exercise drills. The difference between the two practice regimes was that the SVT session was performed wearing stroboscopic glasses and the control training was performed with similar glasses without lenses. Cognition was evaluated by a computerized software (Mindstreams(®), NeuroTrax Corp., NY). Gait and balance were evaluated via wearable accelerometers (APDM, Oregon, USA). Outcome measures were collected twice during a single session, prior to training and immediately afterward. Information processing speed (p = 0.003) increased at the post-evaluation compared with baseline, solely in the SVT session.

However, less is known about its relevance with regards to walking capacity during free-living walking performance. Therefore, the ecological validity of the 2MWT was tested by 1. computing free-living minutes with the same intensity (cadence) as during the 2MWT and 2. investigating the relationship between 2MWT cadence and minutes with the same cadence during free-living walking. 20 pwMS aged 44.2 ± 12.2 (Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 3.1 ± 1.4) performed a 2MWT and wore an accelerometer for seven days. The number of pwMS reaching 100%, 90%, 80% or 70% of 2MWT cadence for at least one minute a day and minutes/day with at least 100%, 90%, 80% and 70% of 2MWT cadence during free-living walking was calculated. Six participants reached 100% of the 2MWT cadence for at least one minute/day during free-living walking. A total of 80% 2MWT cadence was the first intensity category that was reached by all participants during free-living walking. No significant correlation was found between cadence in the 2MWT and minutes in which this cadence was reached during free-living walking.

The purpose of this study was to determine how relationships between trunk and foot acceleration variability relate to physiological impairments, clinical disability scales, and mobility questionnaires in persons with multiple sclerosis. Methods: 15 fallers and 25 non-fallers with multiple sclerosis walked on a treadmill at normal walking speed while trunk and foot accelerations were recorded with wireless accelerometers and variability measures were extracted and used to calculate the gait stability index metrics as a ratio of trunk acceleration variability divided foot acceleration variability. Subjects' sensorimotor delays and lower extremity vibration sensitivity were tested. Subjects also completed clinical disability scales (Guy's Neurological Disability Scale and Patient Reported Expanded Disability Status Scale) and mobility questionnaires (Falls Efficacy Scale, Activities Balance Confidence Scale, 12 Item Multiple Sclerosis Walk Scale). Findings: Multiple gait stability index metrics were significantly correlated with clinical measures of disability and mobility in multiple sclerosis subjects (r = 0.3540.528), but no correlations were found for sensorimotor delays or lower extremity sensation. Multiple gait stability indices performed at least as well as clinical questionnaires for separating fallers from non-fallers. Interpretation: The gait stability indices can potentially be used outside of a laboratory setting to measure walking characteristics related to fall history and disability level in people with multiple sclerosis.",Article,10.1016/J.CLINBIOMECH.2020.105100,http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=18791271&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.clinbiomech.2020.105100&atitle=Trunk+and+foot+acceleration+variability+during+walking+relates+to+fall+history+and+clinical+disability+in+persons+with+multiple+sclerosis&stitle=Clin.+Biomech.&title=Clinical+Biomechanics&volume=80&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Craig&aufirst=Jordan+J.&auinit=J.J.&aufull=Craig+J.J.&coden=CLBIE&isbn=&pages=-&date=2020&auinit1=J&auinitm=J,Embase,No,Out of scope (topic),,yes,,,included,

This project examined the utility of a head-worn inertial measurement unit (IMU) to quantify head movement frequency, velocity, and amplitude during gaze stability exercises. METHODS: Twenty-eight individuals with multiple sclerosis and complaints of dizziness or a history of falls were randomly assigned to either a strength and aerobic exercise (SAE) or gaze and postural stability (GPS) group. During a 6-week intervention, participants wore a head-mounted IMU 3 times (early, middle, and late). For aim 1, the frequency, mean peak velocity, and mean peak amplitude of head turns during equivalent duration components of group-specific exercises were compared using general linear models. For aim 2, the progression of treatment in the GPS group was examined using general linear regression models for each outcome. RESULTS: Aim 1 revealed the GPS group demonstrated significantly greater velocity and amplitude head turns during treatment than the SAE group. The frequency of head turns did not significantly differ between the 2 groups. The aim 2 analyses demonstrated that the yaw and pitch frequency of head turns significantly increased during gaze stability exercises over the 6-week intervention. Velocity and amplitude of head turns during yaw and pitch gaze stability exercises did not significantly change. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: A head-worn IMU during rehabilitation distinguished between groups. Furthermore, within the GPS group, the IMU quantified the progression of the frequency of head movements during gaze stability exercises over time.Video Abstract available for more insights from the authors (see the Video, Supplemental Digital Content 1, available at: http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A320).",Article,10.1097/NPT.0000000000000329,http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=15570584&id=doi:10.1097%2FNPT.0000000000000329&atitle=Turning+Toward+Monitoring+of+Gaze+Stability+Exercises%3A+The+Utility+of+Wearable+Sensors&stitle=J+Neurol+Phys+Ther&title=Journal+of+neurologic+physical+therapy+%3A+JNPT&volume=44&issue=4&spage=261&epage=267&aulast=Loyd&aufirst=Brian+J.&auinit=B.J.&aufull=Loyd+B.J.&coden=&isbn=&pages=261-267&date=2020&auinit1=B&auinitm=J,Embase,Yes,,,no,Out of scope,Occulomotor assessment,Out of scope (topic),

Methods: MS participants were recruited for a double-blind, parallel-arm, randomized, sham-controlled trial and assigned to 10 sessions (5 d/wk for 2 weeks) of either active or sham tDCS paired with unloaded cycling for 20 minutes. Stimulation was administered over the left M1 cortex (2.5 mA; anode over C3/cathode over FP2). Gait spatiotemporal parameters were assessed using a wearable inertial sensor (10-meter and 2-minute walking tests). Measurements were collected at baseline, end of tDCS intervention, and 4-week postintervention to test for duration of any benefits. Results: A total of 15 participants completed the study, nine in the active and six in the sham condition. The active and sham groups were matched according to gender (50% vs. 40% female), neurologic disability (median EDSS 5.5 vs. 5), and age (mean 52.1 ± 12.9 vs. 53.7 ± 9.8 years). The active group had a significantly greater increase in gait speed (0.87 vs. 1.20 m/s, p < 0.001) and distance covered during the 2-minute walking test (118.53 vs. 133.06 m, p < 0.001) at intervention end compared to baseline.

It is also not known how different definitions of a gait bout in daily life monitoring affects the ability to distinguish pathological gait quality. Specifically, how many seconds of a pause with no walking indicates an end to one gait bout and the start of another bout? In this study, we investigated the effect of 3 gait bout definitions on the discriminative ability to distinguish quality of walking in people with multiple sclerosis (MS) from healthy control subjects (HC) during a week of daily living. Methods: 15 subjects with MS and 16 HC wore instrumented socks on each foot and one Opal sensor over the lower lumbar area for a week of daily activities for at least 8 h/day. Three gait bout definitions were based on the length of the pause between the end of one gait bout and start of another bout (1.25 s, 2.50 s, and 5.0 s pause). Area under the curve (AUC) was used to compare gait quality measures in MS versus HC. Results: Total number of gait bouts over the week were statistically significantly different across bout definitions, as expected. However, AUCs of gait quality measures (such as gait speed, stride length, stride time) discriminating people with MS from HC were not different despite the 3 bout definitions. Significance: Quality of gait measures that discriminate MS from HC during daily life are not influenced by the length of a gait bout, despite large differences in quantity of gait across bout definitions. Thus, gait quality measures in people with MS versus controls can be compared across studies using different gait bout definitions with pause lengths ?5 s.",Article,10.1016/J.GAITPOST.2020.11.024,http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=18792219&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.gaitpost.2020.11.024&atitle=Does+gait+bout+definition+influence+the+ability+to+discriminate+gait+quality+between+people+with+and+without+multiple+sclerosis+during+daily+life%3F&stitle=Gait+Posture&title=Gait+and+Posture&volume=84&issue=&spage=108&epage=113&aulast=Shah&aufirst=Vrutangkumar+V.&auinit=V.V.&aufull=Shah+V.V.&coden=GAPOF&isbn=&pages=108-113&date=2021&auinit1=V&auinitm=V,Embase,No,Out of scope (topic),,yes,,,included,

How-ever, little is known about how to tailor activity pacing for people with multiple sclerosis. This study aims to evaluate the effect of a tailored activity pacing intervention on fatigue and physical activity behaviours in adults with multiple sclerosis. Twenty-one adults with multiple sclerosis, stratified by age and gender, are randomly allocated to either a tailored pacing or control group. Participants wear an accelerometer for seven days that measures physical activity behaviours, and self-report fatigue at the baseline and four-week follow-up. Physical activity behaviours are assessed by exam-ining activity level (seven-day average activity counts per minute) and activity variability (seven-day average highest activity counts each day divided by activity counts on that day). The intervention improves activity levels (Mean difference = 40.91; 95% Confidence Interval [CI] (3.8477.96); p = 0.03) and lessens activity variability (Mean difference = 0.63; 95% CI (?1.250.02); p = 0.04). No significant effect is found for fatigue (Mean difference = 0.36; 95% CI (?1.020.30); p = 0.27).

The smartphone SDMT showed comparable psychometric properties in 154 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and 39 healthy volunteers (HV). E.g., smartphone SDMT achieved slightly higher correlations with cognitive subscores of neurological examinations and with brain injury measured by MRI (R(2) = 0.75, Rho = 0.83, p < 0.0001) than traditional SDMT.

Balance symmetry and footstep GRFs are critical indicators of overall gait health and elderly fall risks. Prior works, including direct observation by trained medical personnel, computer vision-, pressure sensor-, and wearable-based sensing, are limited due to operational restrictions. We introduce a nonintrusive balance symmetry monitoring approach, which utilizes sparse structural vibration sensing. The intuition is that footstep-induced floor vibration responses are proportional to footstep GRFs, and balance symmetry can be defined using consecutive GRF pairs. However, GRF-vibration relationships are also influenced by spatially-varying structural properties and gait sampling bias, introducing errors to real-world estimations. We address these challenges first by extracting structural regions to overcome spatially-varying vibration behavior and then by developing a kernel-based robust regression model to overcome biased training data and enable robust GRF and balance symmetry modeling. We evaluate our approach through real-world experiments, achieving a balance symmetry index estimation accuracy as high as 96.5%.
