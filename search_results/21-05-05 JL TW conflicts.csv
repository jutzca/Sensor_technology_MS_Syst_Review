Analyses of biopsies of the tibialis anterior muscle showed that there were fewer type I fibers (66 +/- 6 vs. 76 +/- 6%), and that fibers of all types were smaller (average down arrow 26%) and had lower succinic dehydrogenase (SDH; average down arrow 40%) and SDH/alpha-glycerol-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) but not GPDH activities in MS vs. control subjects, suggesting that muscle in this disease is smaller and relies more on anaerobic than aerobic-oxidative energy supply than does muscle of healthy individuals. Maximal voluntary isometric force for dorsiflexion was associated with both average fiber cross-sectional area (r = 0.71, P = 0.005) and muscle fat-free cross-sectional area by magnetic resonance imaging (r = 0.80, P < 0.001). Physical activity, assessed by accelerometer, was associated with average fiber SDH/GPDH (r = 0.78, P = 0.008). There was a tendency for symptomatic fatigue to be inversely associated with average fiber SDH activity (r = -0.57, P = 0.068). The results of this study suggest that the inherent characteristics of skeletal muscle fibers per se and of skeletal muscle as a whole are altered in the direction of disuse in MS. They also suggest that changes in skeletal muscle in MS may significantly affect function.";"Article";NA;"WOS:A1997YK80700028";"WoS";"No";"Out of scope (topic)";"";"yes";"";"";"Out of scope (topic)";"";"included";""

The ultimate aim is a standard measurement instrument integrated in a belt buckle that allows objective evaluation of treatment and rehabilitation measures in patients, in particular for disabling chronic diseases such as multiple sclerosis. In a first step we combined standard hardware elements to record test data from healthy volunteers. We then developed algorithms to automatically distinguish between different stages of activity, such as jogging, walking, lying, standing and sitting, and to detect and count steps. Distinction between standing and sitting is the most difficult to accomplish. As a first validation, we calculated the distance traveled from data of 17 experiments and a total of 4.5 h, for which one proband was walking and running for a known distance, and compared the results with two commercially available pedometers. We could show that the relative error for the ActiBelt is only half of that for the two pedometers.

Method: Individuals with MS wore an accelerometer for a 7-day period and completed a battery of measures including the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (Godin & Shephard, 1985), Symptom Inventory (Schwartz, Vollmer, & Lee, 1999), MS-Related Symptom Checklist (Gulick, 1989), and abbreviated Late-Life Function and Disability Inventory (McAuley, Konopack, Motl, Rosengren, & Morris, 2005) at baseline (n = 292) and 6-month follow-up (n = 276). The data were analyzed using panel analysis with latent variables in AMOS 16.0. Results: The standardized coefficients indicated that (a) change in physical activity was associated with residual change in function (? = .22), (b) change in symptoms was associated with residual changes in both function (? = -.29) and disability (? = -.15), and (c) change in function was associated with residual change in disability (? = .20).

To compare the effects of gait training with distinct glide-symmetric visual feedback cues, adapted to the geometry of human locomotion, to the effects of training with visual cues of no distinct symmetry, on the walking abilities of subjects with gait disorders due to multiple sclerosis (MS). Methods. Ten patients trained with transverse lines while 11 patients trained with checkerboard tiles, both provided by a wearable virtual reality device. Baseline performance (walking speed and stride length along a 10m straight track) was measured before device use. Following 20min training with the device and 10min rest, performance without the device was measured again and compared to the baseline performance. Results. The average improvement in the group using the visual cue of transverse lines was 7.79±4.24 in walking speed and 7.20±3.92 in stride length. The average improvement in the group using the visual cue of checkerboard tiles was 21.09±18.39 in walking speed and 12.99±1.72 in stride length. Conclusions.

Objective: To evaluate the relationship of gait parameters, and demographic and physical characteristics in healthy men and women. Design, Setting, and Participants: Recruitment of a subsample (n = 358) of male and female blood donors taking part in the Cambridge CardioResource study. Collection of demographic data, measurement of physical characteristics (height, weight and blood pressure) and assessment of 7-day, free-living activity parameters using accelerometry and a novel algorithm to measure walking speed. Participants were a median (interquartile range[IQR]) age of 49 (16) years; 45% women; and had a median (IQR) BMI of 26 (5.4). Main Outcome Measure: Walking speed. Results: In this study, the hypothesis that walking speed declines with age was generated using an initial 'open' dataset. This was subsequently validated in a separate 'closed' dataset that showed a decrease of walking speed of -0.0037 m/s per year. This is equivalent to a difference of 1.2 minutes, when walking a distance of 1 km aged 20 compared to 60 years. Associations between walking speed and other participant characteristics (i.e. gender, BMI and blood pressure) were non-significant. BMI was negatively correlated with the number of walking and running steps and longest non-stop distance. Conclusion: This is the first study using accelerometry which shows an association between walking speed and age in free-living, healthy individuals. Absolute values of gait speed are comparable to published normal ranges in clinical settings. This study highlights the potential use of mobile accelerometry to assess gait parameters which may be indicative of future health outcomes in healthy individuals. © 2011 Schimpl et al.";"Article";"10.1371/JOURNAL.PONE.0023299";"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=19326203&id=doi:10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0023299&atitle=Association+between+walking+speed+and+age+in+healthy%2C+free-living+individuals+using+mobile+accelerometry-a+cross-sectional+study&stitle=PLoS+ONE&title=PLoS+ONE&volume=6&issue=8&spage=&epage=&aulast=Schimpl&aufirst=Michaela&auinit=M.&aufull=Schimpl+M.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2011&auinit1=M&auinitm=";"Embase";"Yes";"";"";"no";"Out of scope";"No MS Patients";"Included";"";"Out of scope (topic)";"Actibelt"

However, in the literature there are only a few papers that address this disorder. The aim of this study is to identify objectively subclinical abnormal gait strategies in these patients. Methods: Eleven patients affected by self-reported unsteadiness during gait (4 TBI and 7 MS) and ten healthy subjects underwent gait analysis while walking back and forth on a 15-m long corridor. Time-distance parameters, ankle sagittal motion, and muscular activity during gait were acquired by a wearable gait analysis system (Step32, DemItalia, Italy) on a high number of successive strides in the same walk and statistically processed. Both self-selected gait speed and high speed were tested under relatively unconstrained conditions. Non-parametric statistical analysis (Mann-Whitney, Wilcoxon tests) was carried out on the means of the data of the two examined groups. Results: The main findings, with data adjusted for velocity of progression, show that increased double support and reduced velocity of progression are the main parameters to discriminate patients with self-reported unsteadiness from healthy controls. Muscular intervals of activation showed a significant increase in the activity duration of the Rectus Femoris and Tibialis Anterior in patients with respect to the control group at high speed. Conclusions: Patients with a subjective sensation of instability, not clinically documented, walk with altered strategies, especially at high gait speed. This is thought to depend on the mechanisms of postural control and coordination. The gait anomalies detected might explain the symptoms reported by the patients and allow for a more focused treatment design. The wearable gait analysis system used for long distance statistical walking assessment was able to detect subtle differences in functional performance monitoring, otherwise not detectable by common clinical examinations.";"Article";"10.1186/1743-0003-9-64";"WOS:000310270200001";"WoS";"Yes";"";"";"no";"";"";"Out of scope (topic)";"";"included";""

Disability status and progression are associated with reduced physical activity (PA) and cardiovascular function. Lack of adequate PA combined with inflammation may create high susceptibility to subclinical atherosclerosis and vascular dysfunction. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to compare subclinical atherosclerosis and arterial function between individuals with and without MS matched for age, sex, and body mass index. Methods: Thirty-three individuals diagnosed with MS and 33 controls underwent strain gauge plethysmography for resting forearm blood flow (FBF) and peak reactive hyperemia for the microvascular function. Intima-media thickness and arterial compliance (AC) were measured using carotid ultrasound for vascular function. C-reactive protein and PA (7-d accelerometer data) were also measured. Results: There was a significant difference (P G 0.05) in resting FBF, peak reactive hyperemia, central pulse wave velocity, and AC between the MS and control groups. PA was associated with peak FBF and central pulse wave velocity but not FBF and carotid AC. Individuals with MS exhibit reduced arterial function but similar intima-media thickness compared with controls. Persons with MS had significantly reduced PA levels compared with controls, and PA accounted for differences in arterial function between groups. Conclusions: These results indicate that subclinical markers of atherosclerosis are higher in individuals with MS, suggesting a higher risk of cardiovascular disease in this population. However, the higher levels of subclinical atherosclerosis were accounted for by the low PA in persons with MS, suggesting that increasing PA may reduce the increase in cardiovascular disease risk in patients with MS.

Local Dynamic Stability (LDS), a non-linear gait stability index, has been advocated as an early indicator of risk for falls. With this longitudinal study over three weeks, we aimed to assess the responsiveness of Local Dynamic Stability to a rehabilitation program and to compare it to other measures. Eighteen patients (mean 54 years, median EDSS score: 5) participated. They were admitted to inpatient rehabilitation and received a three weeks individually tailored program. They performed a 3-minute walking test at the beginning and at the end of the stay, as well as pain, wellbeing, fatigue, and balance assessment.

At the end of the rehabilitation process, patients reported reduced pain (Effect Size: -0.7), fatigue (ES:-0.6), and increased wellbeing (ES: 1.1). A small positive effect on static balance was observed (ES: 0.3). LDS was improved (ES: 0.6), and the effect was higher than walking speed improvement (ES: 0.4).

A Reliability and Comparison Study in Healthy Individuals and in Patients with Paresis of the Lower Extremities";"PLOS ONE";2014;"Falls while walking are frequent in patients with muscular dysfunction resulting from neurological disorders. Falls induce injuries that may lead to deconditioning and disabilities, which further increase the risk of falling. Therefore, an early gait stability index would be useful to evaluate patients in order to prevent the occurrence of future falls. Derived from chaos theory, local dynamic stability (LDS), defined by the maximal Lyapunov exponent, assesses the sensitivity of a dynamic system to small perturbations. LDS has already been used for fall risk prediction in elderly people. The aim of the present study was to provide information to facilitate future researches regarding gait stability in patients with neurological gait disorders. The main objectives were 1) to evaluate the intra-session repeatability of LDS in patients and 2) to assess the discriminative power of LDS to differentiate between healthy individuals and neurological patients. Eighty-three patients with mild to moderate neurological disorders associated with paresis of the lower extremities and 40 healthy controls participated in the study. The participants performed 2x30 s walking wearing a 3D accelerometer attached to the lower back, from which 2x35 steps were extracted. LDS was defined as the average exponential rate of divergence among trajectories in a reconstructed state-space that reflected the gait dynamics. LDS assessed along the medio-lateral axis offered the highest repeatability and discriminative power. Intra-session repeatability (intraclass correlation coefficient between the two repetitions) in the patients was 0.89 and the smallest detectable difference was 16%.

Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: University medical center. Participants: Persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) (n=40) were compared with similar aged control subjects (n=20). There were 20 subjects with MS in the normal walking velocity group and 20 subjects with MS who had slow walking velocity based on a timed 25-foot walk (T25FW) of <5 seconds. Interventions: None. Main Outcome Measures: Postural response latency, sway variables, trunk motion variables. Results: We found that subjects with MS with both slow or normal walking velocities had significantly longer postural response latencies than the healthy control group. Postural response latency was not correlated with the T25FW. Postural response latency was significantly correlated with center of pressure sway variables during quiet standing (root mean square: rho=.334, P=.04; range: rho=.385, P=.017; mean velocity: rho=.337, P=.038; total sway area: rho=.393, P=.015). Postural response latency was also significantly correlated with motion of the trunk during walking (sagittal plane range of motion: rho=.316, P=.05; SD of transverse plane range of motion: rho=-.43, P=.006). Conclusions: These findings clearly indicate that slow postural responses to external perturbations in patients with MS contribute to disturbances in balance control during both standing and walking.

Even though there are several tools available to quantify ambulatory behavior in a home environment, reliable measurement of joint motion is still limited to laboratory tests. The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a novel inertial sensor system for ambulatory behavior and joint motion measurement in the everyday environment. An algorithm for behavior classification, step detection, and knee angle calculation was developed. The validation protocol consisted of simulated daily activities in a laboratory environment. The tests were performed with ten healthy subjects and eleven patients with multiple sclerosis. Activity classification showed comparable performance to commercially available activPAL sensors. Step detection with our sensor system was more accurate. The calculated flexion-extension angle of the knee joint showed a root mean square error of less than 5° compared with results obtained using an electro-mechanical goniometer. This new system combines ambulatory behavior assessment and knee angle measurement for long-term measurement periods in a home environment.

Accelerometric (ACC) and electromyographic (EMG) recordings were performed in 26 MS patients complaining of clumsiness, associated (n= 16) or not associated (n= 10) with visible tremor. Seventeen healthy subjects with physiological tremor (PT) and eight patients with essential tremor (ET) served as controls. Signals were analyzed using non-linear Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and related Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT), compared to the standard linear spectral analysis using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The presence of cerebellar signs and motor deficit was assessed on clinical examination. Using FFT, tremor was found in all patients with ET and 12% of subjects with PT, but in none of the MS patients, even in the presence of visible tremor. In contrast, EMD-HHT analysis of ACC-EMG coupling showed common frequency peaks characterizing tremor related to a central generator in 62.5% of MS patients with visible tremor, 40% of MS patients without visible tremor, 29% of subjects with PT, and all patients with ET. In EMD-HHT analysis, tremor characteristics were similar in subjects with PT and MS patients, regardless of the presence of a visible tremor, but these characteristics clearly differed in patients with ET. A visible tremor in MS patients was associated with more frequent cerebellar signs and less motor deficit at the upper limb. The low-frequency tremor observed in MS patients could therefore originate in lesions of the brainstem (midbrain) or cerebellothalamic circuits, or may correspond to an enhanced PT, partly favored by cerebellar dysfunction and being more visible during movement execution in the absence of concomitant motor deficit.";"Article";"10.1016/J.NEUCLI.2015.09.013";"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=17697131&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.neucli.2015.09.013&atitle=Analysis+of+tremor+in+multiple+sclerosis+using+Hilbert-Huang+Transform&stitle=Neurophysiol.+Clin.&title=Neurophysiologie+Clinique&volume=45&issue=6&spage=475&epage=484&aulast=Ayache&aufirst=S.-S.&auinit=S.-S.&aufull=Ayache+S.-S.&coden=NCLIE&isbn=&pages=475-484&date=2015&auinit1=S&auinitm=-S";"Embase";"Yes";"";"";"no";"Out of scope";"";"Included";"";"Out of scope (outcomes)";""

Methods: Thirty-eight participant pairs (MS and cohabitant) aged 18-55 years participated in the study. Each participant received an Android HTC Sensation 4G smartphone containing a custom application suite of 19 tests capturing participant performance and patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Over 1 year, participants were prompted daily to complete one assigned test. Results: A total of 22 patients with MS and 17 cohabitants completed the entire study. Among patients with MS, low scores on PROs relating tomental and visual function were associated with dropout (p < 0.05). We illustrate several novel features of a smartphone platform. First, fluctuations in MS outcomes (e.g., fatigue) were assessed against an individual's ambient environment by linking responses to meteorological data. Second, both response accuracy and speed for the Ishihara color vision test were captured, highlighting the benefits of both active and passive data collection. Third, a new trait, a person-specific learning curve in neuropsychological testing, was identified using spline analysis. Finally, averaging repeated measures over the study yielded the most robust correlation matrix of the different outcome measures.

About 1/5 will eventually receive a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS). Up to 3/4 of children with MS suffer from depression, fatigue, and/or cognitive impairment. Previous studies in healthy adolescents and adults with MS have shown physical activity (PA) to benefit cognition and psychosocial outcomes. Investigating PA may help in the development of non-pharmacologic interventions for symptom management in pediatric MS. Goals: To investigate: (1) PA levels in youth with monophasic ADS (mono-ADS) and MS in comparison to healthy controls (HC); (2) The associations of PA levels in youth with MS wh experience fatigue and depression. Methods: 74 consecutive patients were recruited from the Neuroinflammatory Clinic at the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada (25 MS, 49 mono-ADS). 45 HC were recruited by flyers/word of mouth. Accelerometry (7 days), PA (Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ)), fatigue (PedsQL MFS) and depression (CES-DC) questionnaires were completed by all participants. SickKids research ethics approval was obtained. Results: MS participants (15.7±1.9 yo) were older than mono- ADS (13.7±2.6; p=0.001) and HC (14.4±2.4; p=0.03) participants. The proportion of females was not different across groups (p=0.14). Accelerometer data showed lower vigorous PA in the MS group (0.07±1.5 min/d) than in the mono-ADS (3.3±5.6 min/d; p=0.006) and HC (5.6±5.0 min/d; p=0.004) groups. On the GLTEQ, indicated MS patients compared with mono-ADS patients participated in lower levels of strenuous (17±18 vs. 30±21 METs, p=0.01) and total (42±29 vs. 63±32 METs, p=0.02) PA. Results remained after controlling for age. No differences were found in fatigue or depression between the groups. For the MS group, fatigue was correlated with depression (r=0.76) and vigorous PA was negatively correlated with fatigue (r=-0.53) and depression (r=-0.54). Conclusions: Youth with MS participate in less vigorous/strenuous PA than their mono-ADS and HC counterparts. Those who participate in higher levels of vigorous PA report fewer depressive and fatigue symptoms. This study is limited by its crosssectional nature, therefore, directionality of this association is unknown. Future investigations should focus on interventions that will help increase the amount of vigorous/strenuous PA as this may have the potential to ameliorate depression and fatigue in youth with MS.";"Conference Abstract";"10.1177/1352458515602642";"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=13524585&id=doi:10.1177%2F1352458515602642&atitle=Low+levels+of+participation+in+vigorous+physical+activity+in+youth+with+multiple+sclerosis+and+the+associations+with+fatigue+and+depression&stitle=Mult.+Scler.&title=Multiple+Sclerosis&volume=23&issue=11&spage=379&epage=380&aulast=Grover&aufirst=S.A.&auinit=S.A.&aufull=Grover+S.A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=379-380&date=2015&auinit1=S&auinitm=A";"Embase";"Yes";"";"";"no";"Out of scope";"youth population";"Abstract only";"";"included";"accelerometer used as outcome measure"

Methods The study employed a multivariate, replicated, single-subject repeated-measures (MRSRM) design and involved four individuals with MS. Mood, fatigue, pain, balance confidence, and losses of balance were measured daily over 28 days by self-report. Physical activity was also measured daily over this same time period via accelerometry. Dynamic factor analysis (DFA) was used to determine the dimensionality and lagged relationships across the variables. Results Person-specific models revealed considerable time-dependent co-variation patterns as well as pattern variation across subjects.

Outcome measures included the Symbol Digit Modalities Test to assess cognition. Texting measures included accuracy (%) and duration(s). Gait was assessed with axial accelerometers to quantify temporal measures. The dual-task cost percentage for the walking tests and texting accuracy was determined by calculating the percentage change from a single task to a double task. The impact of texting while walking on gait measures was significantly higher in PwMS; furthermore, texting was less accurate compared to the healthy controls.

Methods This two-phase study recruited online research network members reporting MS and who were utilizing Fitbit One (TM) activity trackers. In the first phase, participant interviews assessed demand based on physical activity and the use of behavior-change techniques. The second phase assessed the demand, limited efficacy, acceptability, and practicality of a Wearables 101 course that integrated behavior change and self-experimentation principles. Tracker data were used to determine the percent of matches between daily symptom-based step goals and step counts. Results Participants expressed demand in the form of interest in gaining insights about a possible sweet spot behavioral target, if a system could be produced to support that. Limited efficacy results were mixed, with approximately one-third of participants dropping out and only half matching their daily target goals for at least 50% of days. In terms of practicality, participants commented on the burden of daily measurement and the need for a longer baseline period. Participants noted that tracking helped support an understanding of the link between activities and symptom severity, suggesting acceptability. Conclusions Results suggested that the intervention demand and acceptability criteria were demonstrated more strongly than limited efficacy and practicality. The matching intervention tested in this study will require refinement in baseline measurement, goal definition, and reduced data-gathering burden. Such changes may improve efficacy and practicality requirements and, by extension, later impact of the intervention on MS outcomes. Overall, these results provide justification for additional work on refining the intervention to increase practicality and efficacy.";"Article";"10.1177/2055207619872077";"WOS:000483763900001";"WoS";"Yes";"";"Fitbit";"no";"Out of scope";"Read for discussion";"Included";"";"Out of scope (outcomes)";"Fitbit"

Setting: Clinical setting. Participants: Thirty adults with neurologic disorders (10 with multiple sclerosis, 10 with Parkinson disease, and 10 with stroke) and 20 healthy volunteers. Methods: Participants were assessed with the Timed Up and Go test (TUG) and with the mDGI. During the assessment of mDGI, data were collected by a single Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) positioned on the sternum. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the instrumented data extracting eight PC scores (ImPC) describing dynamic balance. The instrumented overall score (ImDGI) was then calculated as the sum of the mPCs. PCA revealed two components associated with stride features and regularity (ImDGI_Gait_Pattern) and trunk movements (ImDGI_Trunk_Sway). Spearman coefficients were calculated between mDGI and ImDGI, whereas Mann-Whitney (U) and Kruskal-Wallis (H) tests assessed differences between groups and neurologic conditions. Main Outcome Measurements: ImDGI. Results: ImDGI did not show ceiling effects, and good correlations were found between ImDGI and mDGI (r =.84), and TUG (r =.84) for people with neurologic disorders (P <.001). Significant differences among pathologies (H test((2))=12.5, P =.002) and between healthy participants and adults with neurologic disorders (U test = 47.0, P =.001) were found.

Method: This article elaborates on a step-detection method based on personalized templates tested against a gold standard. Twenty-two individuals with pMS and 10 young healthy subjects (HSs) were instructed to walk on an electronic walkway wearing synchronized IMUs. Templates were derived from the IMU signals by using Initial and Final Contact times given by the walkway. These were used to detect steps from other gait trials of the same individual (intra-individual template-based detection, IITD) or another participant from the same group (pMS or HS) (intra-group template-based detection, IGTD). All participants were seen twice with a 6-month interval, with two measurements performed at each visit. Performance and accuracy metrics were computed, along with a similarity index (SId), which was computed as the mean distance between detected steps and their respective closest template. Results: For HS participants, both the IITD and the IGTD algorithms had precision and recall of 1.00 for detecting steps. For pMS participants, precision and recall ranged from 0.94 to 1.00 for IITD and 0.85 to 0.95 for IGTD depending on the level of disability. The SId was correlated with performance and the accuracy of the result. An SId threshold of 0.957 (IITD) and 0.963 (IGTD) could rule out decreased performance (F-measure ? 0.95), with negative predictive values of 0.99 and 0.96 with the IITD and IGTD algorithms. Also, the SId computed with the IITD and IGTD algorithms could distinguish individuals showing changes at 6-month follow-up. Conclusion: This personalized step-detection method has high performance for detecting steps in pMS individuals with severely altered gait. The algorithm can be self-evaluating with the SI, which gives a measure of the confidence the clinician can have in the detection. What is more, the SId can be used as a biomarker of change in disease severity occurring between the two measurement times.";"Article";"10.3389/FNEUR.2020.00261";"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=16642295&id=doi:10.3389%2Ffneur.2020.00261&atitle=Personalized+Template-Based+Step+Detection+From+Inertial+Measurement+Units+Signals+in+Multiple+Sclerosis&stitle=Front.+Neurol.&title=Frontiers+in+Neurology&volume=11&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Vienne-Jumeau&aufirst=Ali%C3%A9nor&auinit=A.&aufull=Vienne-Jumeau+A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2020&auinit1=A&auinitm=";"Embase";"Yes";"";"";"no";"Out of scope";"";"Out of scope (topic)";"";"included";""

In order to mitigate its effects, proper rehabilitation therapy is mandatory, in which individualisation is a key factor. Technological solutions can provide the information required for this purpose, by monitoring patients and extracting relevant indicators. In this work, a novel Sensorized Tip is proposed for monitoring People with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS) that require Assistive Devices for Walking (ADW) such as canes or crutches. The developed Sensorized Tip can be adapted to the personal ADW of each patient to reduce its impact, and provides sensor data while naturally walking in the everyday activities. This data that can be processed to obtain relevant indicators that helps assessing the status of the patient. Different from other approaches, a full validation of the proposed processing algorithms is carried out in this work, and a preliminary study-case is carried out with PwMS considering a set of indicators obtained from the Sensorized Tip's processed data. Results of the preliminary study-case demonstrate the potential of the device to monitor and characterise patient status.";"Article";"10.3390/S20154329";"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14248220&id=doi:10.3390%2Fs20154329&atitle=Sensorized+Tip+for+Monitoring+People+with+Multiple+Sclerosis+that+Require+Assistive+Devices+for+Walking&stitle=Sensors+%28Basel%29&title=Sensors+%28Basel%2C+Switzerland%29&volume=20&issue=15&spage=&epage=&aulast=Brull&aufirst=Asier&auinit=A.&aufull=Brull+A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2020&auinit1=A&auinitm=";"Embase";"No";"Out of scope (topic)";"";"yes";"";"";"Included";"";"Out of scope (topic)";"pressure sensor for canes etc"

The efficacy of SVT has never been examined in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS), therefore, our aim was to examine the immediate effect of SVT on cognitive function, gait and static balance performance in PwMS. This assessor-blinded, randomized crossover study included 26 PwMS, 16 females, mean age 47.9 and median EDSS score 4.5. Participants attended two sessions: SVT and control training. Exercises for both the SVT and control sessions were based on ball-catching tasks. Training sessions were identical in length (40–50 min) and type of exercise drills. The difference between the two practice regimes was that the SVT session was performed wearing stroboscopic glasses and the control training was performed with similar glasses without lenses. Cognition was evaluated by a computerized software (Mindstreams(®), NeuroTrax Corp., NY). Gait and balance were evaluated via wearable accelerometers (APDM, Oregon, USA). Outcome measures were collected twice during a single session, prior to training and immediately afterward. Information processing speed (p = 0.003) increased at the post-evaluation compared with baseline, solely in the SVT session. No differences between pre–post evaluations were observed for other cognitive scores following the SVT session. No differences between pre–post measurements were noted for gait and balance following the SVT session. The present study’s results justify performing future RCT studies to examine the effects of a longer SVT program on cognition in PwMS.";"Article";"10.1007/S00702-020-02190-2";"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=14351463&id=doi:10.1007%2Fs00702-020-02190-2&atitle=The+immediate+effect+of+stroboscopic+visual+training+on+information-processing+time+in+people+with+multiple+sclerosis%3A+an+exploratory+study&stitle=J.+Neural+Transm.&title=Journal+of+Neural+Transmission&volume=127&issue=8&spage=1125&epage=1131&aulast=Shalmoni&aufirst=Nov&auinit=N.&aufull=Shalmoni+N.&coden=JNTRF&isbn=&pages=1125-1131&date=2020&auinit1=N&auinitm=";"Embase";"No";"Out of scope (topic)";"";"yes";"";"";"Out of scope (topic)";"";"included";"accelerometer used as outcome measure"

This project examined the utility of a head-worn inertial measurement unit (IMU) to quantify head movement frequency, velocity, and amplitude during gaze stability exercises. METHODS: Twenty-eight individuals with multiple sclerosis and complaints of dizziness or a history of falls were randomly assigned to either a strength and aerobic exercise (SAE) or gaze and postural stability (GPS) group. During a 6-week intervention, participants wore a head-mounted IMU 3 times (early, middle, and late). For aim 1, the frequency, mean peak velocity, and mean peak amplitude of head turns during equivalent duration components of group-specific exercises were compared using general linear models. For aim 2, the progression of treatment in the GPS group was examined using general linear regression models for each outcome. RESULTS: Aim 1 revealed the GPS group demonstrated significantly greater velocity and amplitude head turns during treatment than the SAE group. The frequency of head turns did not significantly differ between the 2 groups. The aim 2 analyses demonstrated that the yaw and pitch frequency of head turns significantly increased during gaze stability exercises over the 6-week intervention. Velocity and amplitude of head turns during yaw and pitch gaze stability exercises did not significantly change. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: A head-worn IMU during rehabilitation distinguished between groups. Furthermore, within the GPS group, the IMU quantified the progression of the frequency of head movements during gaze stability exercises over time.Video Abstract available for more insights from the authors (see the Video, Supplemental Digital Content 1, available at: http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A320).";"Article";"10.1097/NPT.0000000000000329";"http://sfx.metabib.ch/sfx_locater?sid=EMBASE&issn=15570584&id=doi:10.1097%2FNPT.0000000000000329&atitle=Turning+Toward+Monitoring+of+Gaze+Stability+Exercises%3A+The+Utility+of+Wearable+Sensors&stitle=J+Neurol+Phys+Ther&title=Journal+of+neurologic+physical+therapy+%3A+JNPT&volume=44&issue=4&spage=261&epage=267&aulast=Loyd&aufirst=Brian+J.&auinit=B.J.&aufull=Loyd+B.J.&coden=&isbn=&pages=261-267&date=2020&auinit1=B&auinitm=J";"Embase";"Yes";"";"";"no";"Out of scope";"Occulomotor assessment";"Included";"";"Out of scope (topic)";""

Methods: MS participants were recruited for a double-blind, parallel-arm, randomized, sham-controlled trial and assigned to 10 sessions (5 d/wk for 2 weeks) of either active or sham tDCS paired with unloaded cycling for 20 minutes. Stimulation was administered over the left M1 cortex (2.5 mA; anode over C3/cathode over FP2). Gait spatiotemporal parameters were assessed using a wearable inertial sensor (10-meter and 2-minute walking tests). Measurements were collected at baseline, end of tDCS intervention, and 4-week postintervention to test for duration of any benefits. Results: A total of 15 participants completed the study, nine in the active and six in the sham condition. The active and sham groups were matched according to gender (50% vs. 40% female), neurologic disability (median EDSS 5.5 vs. 5), and age (mean 52.1 ± 12.9 vs. 53.7 ± 9.8 years). The active group had a significantly greater increase in gait speed (0.87 vs. 1.20 m/s, p < 0.001) and distance covered during the 2-minute walking test (118.53 vs. 133.06 m, p < 0.001) at intervention end compared to baseline. At 4-week follow-up, these improvements were maintained (baseline vs. follow-up: gait speed 0.87 vs. 1.18 m/s, p < 0.001; distance traveled 118.53 vs. 143.82 m, p < 0.001).
