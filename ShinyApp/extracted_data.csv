Persons with MS who were male and had lower disability status were more likely to have higher initial levels of MVPA that decreased over time. Such results suggest  that  that  behavioral  interventions  for  persons  with  MS should target men and those with lower disability.

The sample further consisted mainly of women, and our results may not be representative of men with MS. We only collected physical activity data at 6-month time intervals  and  perhaps  this  infrequent  sampling  missed  additional  possible changes. Our sample consisted of voluntary participants that may present a bias that limits generalizability. Another limitation is that only participants with at least 2 valid days were included in the estimates of MVPA; stricter wear time criteria (eg, at least 4 days) might provide more accurate estimates of physical activity behavior.

The study involved a small sample of 20 participants who only completed two short linear walks. In addition, one participant was only able to complete one walk due to fatigue. When the sample is considered by EDSS the numbers in each group are small. While it was possible to accurately estimate the mean bias for the majority of participants, our sample was not sufficient to determine the lower cut-off for walking cadence. Future studies could use an adaptive design to recruit participants until a sufficiently precise description of the EDSS and cadence bias association can be established. Validity was assessed during a controlled testing protocol in which participants walked in a straight line indoors. It is possible that greater errors would have been present if walking had been assessed in the free-living environment. However, walking events within this protocol were short and therefore it is possible that relatively smaller errors over longer walking events may be found.

The association of the physical activity parameters to SSST and TUG was modest and therefore physical activity could only to some extent be explained by the SSST and TUG test.","We acknowledge certain limitations in our study. First, the sample size was 99 patients divided into four groups with 15–34 patients in each group which may limit the generalization of the physical activity profile and performance-based function to the general populations of the four groups. Second, since this is a cross-sectional study, we cannot comment on causality, but only on the associations between accelerometer-based physical activity and performance-based function, e.g., we can not conclude that patients with high performance-based function are more physically active. Third, due to the method of recruitment, it is possible that the patients who accepted the study invitation were a selected group of highly motivated people and thus might have a different activity behaviour compared to most people with these four chronic diseases. However, in regard to previous findings in patients with multiple sclerosis, the opposite was found in our population in regard to, e.g., fewer steps taken.

In order to better match the changes in C of the KD to the clinical outcome measures, a better approach would have been to administer the outcome measures at more regular intervals than once every three months. For the measures administered during the clinical visits (EDSS, 9HPT, T25FW, SDMT) and the MRI, this would not have been feasible. However, a higher sampling rate for the self-report measures (AMSQ, FSS, CIS-20R, MFIS, GRC-fatigue, GRC-QoL) would be possible and would allow for clearer insights into the change profiles of the clinically validated outcome measures, leading to better matching with the KD change profiles. Furthermore, due to the preliminary nature of this exploratory study, there is currently not a quantification of how well the C and the CCPs coincide with the changes in the outcome measures. Building on the current analysis, one could investigate the capabilities of both the C and the CCPs in predicting changes in the outcome measures, using time series based predictive modeling.54 The dynamics of complex systems approach to KD would also benefit from future research investigating other methods of feature selection. The current study uses RQA summary statistics; however, there are a host of NLTSA approaches that could be used to select promising keystroke features, for instance, Detrended Fluctuation Analysis.55 Moreover, more in-depth analysis into an appropriate sliding window size for the calculation of F and D of KD in MS is necessary. In this study, we chose a sliding window of 28 days due to the changes in disease activity in MS being markedly slow, while still maximizing the amount of data being shown (the larger the sliding window, the larger the lead-in of the F and D). Last, the keystroke feature selection was conducted on a group level across all the users; however, the results of this analysis would likely be improved by doing individualized feature selection specific to each user. Feature selection on an individual level would likely improve the results as each keystroke feature could hold more complex information to one user over another. For example, one user may have typing sessions that are very consistent and, therefore, have low complexity, whereas another user may usually type quickly and have short session durations apart from when they have worsening of symptoms.",https://www.trialregister.nl/trial/7070,-,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,RW: Dexterity/Tremor,,,,,,yes,significance not tested,yes,significance not tested,"MRI, 9HPT, T25FW, SDMT, FSS, AMSQ, CIS-20R, MFIS, GRC-fatigue, GRC-QoL",no,,no,,no,,,no,,yes,significance not tested,no,,no,

We further note that general guidelines for valid accelerometer data are that the device is worn for 10+ hours per day, and we only included days of data that satisfied this criterion. There further was variability in the number of valid days of accelerometer data across participants, and this might represent a weakness, if the variability reflects poor compliance with wearing the device. We only included a single measure of perceived fatigue severity under the assumption that fatigue is stable over time, and there might be differential results for the perceived impact of fatigue, as measured by the MFIS,32 on physical activity and sedentary behavior in MS. Future analyses might consider other approaches for measuring fatigue and examining its association with physical activity and sedentary behaviors, including capturing cognitive or psychosocial aspects of fatigue that could be associated with these outcomes.42,43 Finally, we did not account for other fatigue management approaches such as energy conservation or medications that might account for association between fatigue and physical activity/sedentary behavior in our analyses because this was a cross-sectional study.",-,"Motl? recruitment occurred through the random selection of 1000 persons with MS who completed the biannual NARCOMS registry update survey (Fall, 2017)",yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,applies partially,applies partially,no,yes,RW: Physical activity,,,,,,no,,yes,significant,FSS,no,,yes,significant,no,,,no,,no,,no,,no,

First, we had a modest sample size of only 15–16 subjects in each group. This also resulted in a modest statistical power for detecting differences. If a larger number of subjects had been included, additional measures would have been able to discriminate between the neurological groups from their matched controls. Further analysis is needed with larger cohorts to test the generalizability of the findings. Second, we used a conservative correction for multiple hypothesis tests. Many of the tests we performed were on measures of gait that at correlated and not statistically independent. The Bonferroni correction assumes these tests are independent, so the correction may have reduced the power of the statistical tests so that additional measures are actually statistically significant. Thirdly, for daily life data, we assumed that subjects attempt to be in the ON-medication state most of the time, and hence, we compared with laboratory walking test only with subjects with their ON state. Further, future studies need to determine the test–retest reliability and sensitivity of the top mobility measures to a treatment and disease progression in daily life to be useful as digital biomarkers for clinical trials.

On the other hand, intermittent assessment is more likely to be adopted in routine clinical practice. Seasonal variation may be important, since people may be more active during the summer months. Limited data was collected on the socioeconomic background or normal ambulation behaviours and environment, so activity differences related to participant lifestyles could not be controlled for. In this cohort, the mean baseline EDSS was 5.7 (range 1.5 to 6.5).

Several of these mobility measures from a week of passive monitoring in daily life were also related to clinical and patient-reported outcomes of neurological severity, providing clinical concurrent validity. Thus, the most sensitive objective measures of daily life mobility for clinical trials and clinical practice need to be specific for each neurological disease.","There are several limitations to the current study. First, the turn algorithm used in this study was defined by a threshold on a vertical rotational rate of the pelvis (15°/s) [13]. This can be challenging when turns are nearly as slow and small as the angular velocities and angles of trunk motion during gait. Too high a threshold to detect the onset and offset of turns could result in smaller turn angles rather than longer turn durations with the initial and final rate of change of trunk rotation is very slow. Second, we performed all mobility analysis by taking the mean of each measure for all the strides over a week for each subject and thus gave equal weight to each stride. But in reality, gait speed and other measures vary for gait bouts of different lengths [16] and people with MS might have fewer long gait bouts because of fatigue. Hence, future work will focus on analyzing the effect of bout length on each mobility measure and how gait bout length affects the discriminatory power of each mobility measure. Thirdly, we ranked mobility measures characterizing mobility impairments in MS and PD based on AUC, but we cannot assume this ranking would be identical across all cohorts. Future work with larger cohorts is needed to investigate if these findings would generalize to other individuals. Lastly, in this paper, we report the most discriminative mobility measures for a specific group of people with MS and a group with PD, but to apply this knowledge in clinical practice, each individual’s gait characteristics are needed to tailor interventions specific for each individual’s specific mobility disability. Future studies need to develop age-related normative values for passive monitoring of mobility. Future work would also explore how to characterize diurnal fluctuations of mobility throughout the day.",-,patients from 10.1186/S12984-020-00781-4 ?,yes,yes,yes,applies partially,yes,yes,applies partially,no,yes,RW: Gait,,,,,,yes,significant,yes,significant,"MFIS, 25FW",yes,mixed,no,,no,,,no,,no,,no,,no,

Wear time alone cannot be considered as evidence for the smartphone as an outcome of real-life activity. However, smartphone covered ~72% of the ActiGraph measurement time. Future studies need to validate against other outcomes or devices. Moreover, we asked the participants to wear the smartphone in their habitual wearing position, aiming to simulate the real-life condition and to avoid the possibly perceived invasiveness. Although the usual position like handbag, backpack, and pants pocket probably does not have differences in the accuracy of measurement (40), the smartphone secured on the upper arm showed a lower accuracy (41). Another limitation is that it is impossible to determine if the phone estimates would remain comparable with other phone models that have not been tested. However, one of the most prominent android brands was used in this study. Finally, we only investigated a rather simple summary metric of 60-s epochs, which reduces the complexity of the raw data. Advanced algorithms, for example, estimating walking speed, might improve the validity of smartphone accelerometry, as it has been shown for research-grade devices (25).",-,-,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,applies partially,no,yes,RW: Physical activity,,,,,,yes,mixed,yes,mixed,"MSWS (m), 2MWT (m), 6MWT (m), FTSTS (m), T25FW (m), GLTEQ (m), FAI (ns), IPAQ (ns)",yes,significant,yes,non-significant,no,,,no,,no,,no,,no,

Multivariate modelling of these features was shown to reliably predict 9HPT times.","First, a limitation of this work is the reliance on estimating a narrow clinical proxy of UE function as a ground truth. As discussed, the 9HPT aims to evaluate UE impairment in PwMS, but given it is measured in seconds it can exhibit a large heteroscedasticity and can be highly variable, especially for longer completion times. It was observed that higher 9HPT times had a higher variance for intra subject measurements over clinical visits (figure 8). As such, the 9HPT time should instead not be considered an exact measure [...] The cohort analysed in this study is relatively small (n= 93 subjects). Most MS patients were mildly disabled with respect to their overall and motor specific clinical scores (table 1), and it was observed that the distribution of the 9HPT was highly tailed and skewed towards shorter 9HPT times. [...] Another constraint bound by low subject numbers occurs as generalisability problems across cross-validation folds. [...] This study is longitudinal and data captured can span weeks' worth of testing. A definite limitation is that the temporal aspect of this data is not fully utilised. Instead subject's features are smoothed down as the median and standard deviation across all their available data.

Third, even if the ActiGraph was found to be a valid instrument for measuring steps during free-living walking in pwMS [19,20], walking at slow paces, especially in highly disabled pwMS with altered gait patterns [28] or uneven surfaces and short distances during free-living walking, may limit the accuracy of step detection.

Even if some studies conceptualized experimental alternative motor electrode montages varying the position of the cathode, evidence is still mixed concerning whether these variations can enhance the neuromodulatory effects.

These abnormalities are more prominent in people with MS with higher levels of disability. These assessments were reliable in test-retest analysis, and suitable for clinical use in monitoring patients and in research settings as accurate and responsive outcome measures for clinical trials.","A possible limitation of this study, related to our decision to perform the walking test along a 10-m pathway, is the low number of strides (i.e., five strides for each straight walking pass) included for calculating step regularity, stride regularity, and symmetry.

One limitation is our sample consisted mostly of Caucasian females with income higher than $40 000 and relapsing-remitting MS. The difference in representation of females and males is expected based on the distribution of MS across sex and previous experience, wherein females have a higher volunteer rate than males [27]. Moreover, it is likely that persons from the registry may underrepresent minorities such as African-Americans [28]. Future studies should consider recruiting a larger and more diverse (e.g., minorities, lower-income, progressive MS, and higher disability status) sample to replicate and extend this research to better understand sedentary behaviour in MS. Another limitation of our study was that we did not place checks to ensure participants wore the accelerometer appropriately (i.e., require participants to take photos while wearing the accelerometers); however, we provided thorough instructions as well as a picture illustrating how the accelerometer should be worn for standardisation. We removed the data from persons with MS who had severe, non-ambulatory disease status (i.e., using wheelchair or scooter as main form of mobility or bedridden), as these individuals may not be able to avoid sedentary behaviour.
